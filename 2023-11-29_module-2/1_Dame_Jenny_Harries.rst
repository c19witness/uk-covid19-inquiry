Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry (continued)

**Lady Hallett**: Mr O'Connor.

I hope you didn't have too bad an evening.

**The Witness**: No, fine, thank you very much.

**Mr O'Connor**: Professor Harries, we were looking yesterday at some of your public statements around about March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic. I'd like to move on to a different subject this morning, albeit it's from very much the same time period, and that is an internal email you wrote.

If we could have on screen, please, INQ000151605. Thank you.

Professor, this is an email you wrote on 15 March, which we will recall was in fact a Sunday, it was over that weekend between, as we've heard evidence, the meetings on the evening of Friday the 13th and then the COBR meeting on the Monday and so on.

I wanted to ask you about the detail in the email at the bottom of the page. You, I think it's obvious, were working that weekend. You were no doubt involved in all of the discussions and deliberations and trying to understand the latest data which was causing some concern.

But what we see here is that you're drawing attention to one particular issue relating to the prospect of imposing more severe NPIs, and you ask -- just picking it up a couple of lines in:

"... can I just ask if someone somewhere is also pulling together a risk of other risks of going too early -- or in some cases going at all?"

You say that issues keep being mentioned but you're not seeing them coming through in the paperwork and you're asking for assurance that these issues are being considered somewhere.

And then you say this:

"The critical ones are of implementing programmes without effective social care and community ... support systems in place, which are obvious to everyone and have been mentioned. The ones that bother me most of all currently are those in relation to safeguarding (adult and children) and domestic violence more generally. For some, these risks will be considerably greater than a negative health impact from coronavirus."

So there is you identifying at an early stage those risks, safeguarding, domestic violence. Well, it's obvious that you were concerned about them, Professor. Can you say something about why and also what happened as a result of this email?

**Dame Harries**: Yes, so I think you can see from that email that things were moving fast, I wasn't in the main meetings that you've discussed --

**Counsel Inquiry**: No.

**Dame Harries**: -- but I will have been trying to respond and input to any potential guidance coming through. I mean, I've -- I always put my old director of public health hat on whenever I'm working, whether it be in central government or elsewhere, because it immediately takes you to thinking what's happening to a family, individual in the street, you know, somebody who is in difficulty already. So raising these things, these were perfectly -- these will be normal things to think about if you're public health trained.

The concern I had was I couldn't see them coming through consistently in the documents, and in fact a clinical colleague who was working with me and working on the documents continued to write things into them, and then the next version that came back would not have them in there.

So one of the problems here is, as you can see, I will be commenting -- that was my job, to advise, not -- I wasn't in control of the policy, it wasn't mine -- and documents might go off sort of into the ether and then the next version would come back, and it wasn't easy to control them. But I think what this shows is these issues were definitely being raised.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, they were being raised --

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- and I'm not suggesting it was necessarily part of your function --

**Dame Harries**: No.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- to see them through to the end, but other evidence we've heard is similar, really, it shows people raising these issues but then perhaps nothing being done about them.

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What was your memory, perhaps not necessarily tied to this email, but of that time? Were you conscious that these concerns that you've raised and we've seen others raising were actually taken forward or was it a situation were occasionally it was raised but actually nothing was done, at least in that early period?

**Dame Harries**: So it's very complex because I'm sitting in the Department of Health, many of these issues will be predominantly sitting within the realm of what was then MHCLG or DLUHC, the Department for -- now -- Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and so you're not seeing right across there to see what activity was going on, so I can't answer necessarily, but I did not see the relevant responses. And, as I say, even when colleagues were writing things into guidance they were coming back on the next version taken out.

So I think also there was evidence around this, because as the data -- as we, you know, the numbers of infection started to rise, I know that the domestic violence third sector, voluntary sector, charities were receiving higher numbers of calls because the likelihood, as the sort of public understanding that there might be a lockdown rose, then the call rate suddenly shot up as people, I think, could see what might happen and that their risk would increase. I didn't see that coming through in guidance at that time. It was corrected later, but I don't think it was -- personally I don't think it was given sufficient attention, notwithstanding everybody was working at very, very significant pace.

**Counsel Inquiry**: That of course is understood but it's right, isn't it, that these risks that you're identifying were not the type of risks that would slowly develop over the period of a lockdown, these were risks that would present themselves as soon as families, wives, girlfriends, were required --

**Dame Harries**: Exactly.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- to stay in the same place as other people?

**Dame Harries**: And then they would be slightly potentially lost to the system as well. So once the lockdown occurred and people were staying at home, and I think we -- we're probably not covering children at the moment but, you know, there are children who would be at home and invisible to the system in a way that perhaps had not happened before.

Now, I know there was a lot of work subsequently. I think my concern at this point was, was somebody considering that, sort of as the curtain dropped almost.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I think you've said that from your understanding at the time not enough was done to think about those sorts of concerns at that time?

**Dame Harries**: That I couldn't see, yes, I agree.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's move on, Professor. I want to ask you a few questions about care homes, and again you mentioned later work, and of course it's right that the Inquiry will be looking much more carefully and in much more detail at care homes in a further module. But that said, you were the clinical co-chair of a group of the SAGE Social Care Working Group --

**Dame Harries**: Yep.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- from, you tell us, but I think from later in 2020?

**Dame Harries**: So there was a care -- I think it was a care home modelling group which had been set up as a subgroup of SAGE, and Professor Ian Hall chaired that -- initially, I understand, I wasn't part of it, to look at some of the concerns around rates of infection in care homes. And Professor Hall comes very much from a modelling background, and we've heard lots about modellers.

And then I think Charlotte Watts, who was the Chief Scientific Adviser for the Foreign Office at the time but sitting on SAGE, supported those meetings as well. She stepped down and I think it was around the beginning of July, it was after the first wave but before the winter period, that Patrick Vallance asked me if I would co-chair. And I remember speaking to the CMO at that time and part of that I think was because I had worked in local authorities and I had supported commissioning of services in local authorities. I've actually even worked in care homes as a care home assistant and I'd actually recently been using services as well, so I think there was a knowledge that there was quite a lot of practical understanding.

I'd also been working with the Minister for Care. I'd rather run towards that, that wasn't part of my job, but it felt such an important area to try to link together.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So that's from, you think, about July you joined that committee?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We will see in a moment you were involved at least in discussions about care homes before then?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But is it right it wasn't an area that you were focusing on?

**Dame Harries**: Well, I mean, as a Deputy CMO you will be asked to look at all sorts of guidance but it's -- you don't lead any particular part of policy.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right. Let's look at a document, if we may, and you can help us with it.

It's INQ000151606.

So in fact from a similar period to the documents we've been looking at previously, it's the middle of March, 16 March in fact, and if we look first of all at the email at the bottom, which is an email written by someone called Rosamond Roughton to you, she says:

"Dear Jenny

"We estimate that [approximately] two thirds of people in care homes are over 85. When we introduce the shielding policy, what should our approach be to allowing patients to be discharged into care homes who are symptomatic of Covid-19?

"My working assumption was that we would have to allow discharge to happen, and have very strict infection control? Otherwise presumably the NHS gets clogged up with people who aren't as acutely ill."

Your response on the same day, you say:

"Whilst the prospect is perhaps what none of us would wish to plan for I believe the reality will be that we will need to discharge Covid-19 positive patients into residential care settings for the reason you have noted."

You say it:

"... will be entirely clinically appropriate because the NHS will triage those to retain in acute settings who can benefit from [NHS] care."

And you say:

"The numbers of people with disease will rise sharply within a fairly short timeframe ..."

Just pausing there, do you mean to say the number of people with disease in care homes?

**Dame Harries**: No, I've written -- in the population. This was the context of this. This was almost sort of -- it was exactly that week where the numbers were starting to rise exponentially, and it's that context. This is a very high -- this is not a policy statement, this is a high-level view that says -- Ros was the director for -- DG for social care in the Department of Health at the time, and it was very much -- it was a very bleak picture because I think the reality was -- this isn't an invitation to be discharging Covid patients, it's actually a reality that says if hospitals overflow those who can benefit from treatment there will be there. Anybody -- it doesn't matter whether it's residential care settings or going home or going on to other ones, that hospitals will have to manage that, that those who were physically well to go will go.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Well, let's just finish off the email and then I'll ask you a question.

**Dame Harries**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So there's a reference to the sharp rise -- I think you've -- just a --

**Dame Harries**: Population -- absolutely population --

*(unclear: multiple speakers)*

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- no doubt including in hospitals?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And so you say you suspect:

"... within a fairly short timeframe ... [that will] make this ..."

Which I think you must mean the discharge of symptomatic patients into care homes:

"... fairly normal practice and more acceptable but I do recognise that families and care homes will not welcome this in the initial phase."

Now, of course, much of the debate about discharging patients from hospital into care homes is about asymptomatic patients, I'm not asking you about that.

**Dame Harries**: Yep.

**Counsel Inquiry**: This email is about discharging people who were symptomatic, who were known or at least strongly suspected to be suffering from Covid.

**Dame Harries**: Well, it actually says "Covid-19 positive patients", so I'm anticipating from this that what will happen is the rate of increase in people in the population with Covid will rise absolutely exponentially, that was the data that we'd seen, that hospitals would do their best with this, and that we would have some patients who potentially had gone through the most acute phase, actually were still positive, but then would be of less need, would no longer need acute care, and that -- and obviously hospitals will be treating those then that they can treat and these individuals would be safe -- safe in terms of their physical welfare at the time to move on. And otherwise there wouldn't be places for other people from care homes to go in and be treated.

**Counsel Inquiry**: One understands the logic --

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- and the need for this discharge?

**Dame Harries**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Or at least the case that's made for it, and as I say, I don't want to get into all of that, but on any view what is being discussed in these emails is discharging symptomatic Covid-19, quite possibly infectious Covid-19, patients into care homes?

**Dame Harries**: So just once again, "Covid-19 positive patients," not symptomatic patients, because I don't think they have ever been --

**Counsel Inquiry**: I only used the word "symptomatic" because that's the word that Jenny(sic) Roughton used.

**Dame Harries**: Oh, right, okay.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I don't want to get tied up in --

**Dame Harries**: No, but I mean --

**Counsel Inquiry**: People who'd got Covid were being discharged into care homes?

**Dame Harries**: This sounds awful. This is taking a very, very high-level view that says: if we have this enormous explosion of cases in the population, as you will see, there will have to be a national triage. And I think what I was trying to do was explain to Ros what the size of the problem might be. I don't think it had actually quite registered.

The other thing I would just like to point out there's a really critical point, and that comes through guidance as we go through, in her email, which is about:

"My working assumption was that we would have to allow discharge to happen, and have very strict infection control?"

And that is the critical point.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Well, I'm going to come to that.

May I ask whether at the time of this email exchange you were familiar with an article that the Inquiry has seen which was written, amongst others, by Professor Van-Tam, about infection control, in particular about influenza, in care home facilities?

**Dame Harries**: Yeah -- well, I mean, I wasn't aware at that time -- that's the 2017 paper, I think, if it's -- the one you're referring to?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: And, I mean, it's perfectly sensible.

There is nothing in that -- and, I mean, I think it's why we may get to lessons learned -- there is nothing in that paper, I think -- it's a very erudite paper, but there's nothing in it which would surprise any practising public health physician either this year, in 2017, or for previous years. And I think that is a really critical point for lessons going forward.

**Counsel Inquiry**: He talked, didn't he, in that paper about the risk of what -- the adjective that was used was "explosive" --

**Dame Harries**: Yep.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- outbreaks of influenza in care homes, for all the reasons which you say --

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- you were familiar with --

**Dame Harries**: And that does happen every winter now with influenza, and that's why there are particular outbreak control plans for care homes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But help us with this, Professor: it may be perhaps that this is just an email between professionals and the risks were understood, but for us or for people looking at this afresh, there seems to be a sort of degree of equanimity about discharging large numbers of Covid-19 patients into that very vulnerable environment, where, as you say, those risks were understood?

**Dame Harries**: If I may, I think that's an interpretation, because I start that email with "Whilst the prospect is perhaps what none of us would wish to plan for". This was a very high-level picture, to reinforce, if you like, the position that the country was in at that weekend, and I think we've heard that in other places. If people were not thinking through what the likelihood was in the rise in numbers of cases -- as we've heard, I don't think we have sensible conversations about managing risks. This is not a policy at all, this is a statement of: if you have a pandemic in a country, how on earth are you going to manage that exponential rise in cases?

**Counsel Inquiry**: If you are suddenly in a situation where -- as you say, a highly undesirable situation --

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- where, of necessity, you are finding yourself discharging Covid patients into this very vulnerable environment, then, as Ms Roughton said, strict infection control was obviously important.

And would it be fair to say that it would therefore be necessary to make sure that care homes had proper guidance and, for that matter, maybe mandatory regulation about the clear steps they should take when they are receiving into these care homes infectious patients?

**Dame Harries**: Well, we might come on to the mandatory regulation. I mean, I think the issue here is, as I think Professor Van-Tam gave evidence before, this sound -- I mean, this is just trying to set out: this is the top line, awful prospect, of what could happen with 'X' number of cases. But the reality is, and I think Professor Van-Tam noted, that any person who is discharged into a care home, whether they are positive or not, if they've come from an environment, actually -- whether they've had a test or not, it's actually the infection prevention and control measures which are the critical component over an incubation period.

So yes, I agree with you in principle. I just -- I think we get hung up sometimes on the test, whereas in fact it's the IPC. So I agree with you in principle. The mandatory bit we might come on to.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Or maybe in another module.

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's look briefly, Professor, at the care home guidance that was in force at the time, and there were different sets of guidance that were being published around this time, were there not?

If we can go to INQ000300278, if you can see just below the title, "COVID-19 ...", it was published on 13 March, so in fact only three days before the email we've just been looking at.

If we can go on, please, to page 4 of that document, we see, at the top there, the title "If a resident has symptoms of COVID-19".

Just before we look at the paragraph, Professor, one might have thought, judging by the email and the understanding that, of necessity, care homes were due to receive these possibly large numbers of infectious Covid-19 patients, that they would be told that this was coming and that, as Ms Roughton said, very strict infection control measures would be needed.

In fact -- well, you tell us whether what we see here is consistent with that, but the message is:

"Care homes are not expected to have dedicated isolation facilities for people living in the home but should implement isolation precautions when someone in the home displays symptoms ... in the same way ... [as] if [that] individual had influenza. If isolation is needed, a resident's own room can be used. Ideally the room should be a single bedroom with en suite facilities."

Looking at this now, do you think that that type of guidance was appropriate to circumstances where it was understood that care homes would be receiving possibly large numbers of infectious Covid patients?

**Dame Harries**: So I think we just need to draw a distinction that my message on the 16th was, as you've noted, numbers go up, this was a "just look ahead and think this is what will happen in due course", it doesn't give a timeframe. And I think, on this one, there had been, I think -- the first case in a care home was around the 10th, and I think this guidance actually had been held up from the 7th. It's not -- I'm not sure I've signed it. I did comment on a lot of guidance but I think -- I would have to check, but I think it was PHE guidance and not one that I finally signed off. That doesn't detract from the question.

So I think there is a -- there was new guidance coming through as cases started to rise. So I think as -- as I say, I think the first case was on 10 March. So the critical thing here actually is the isolation. You should not take my email as to say, "the NHS is suddenly going to discharge lots of Covid positive patients and that's absolutely fine". What it was doing was painting a picture to the person who was contributing to policy on the official side at the Department of Health and the isolation issues here -- I mean, there will be a number, you may come on to, around, you know, how you deal with an outbreak in a care home but this is sitting on top of -- because of the Jonathan Van-Tam knowledge, if you like, in that paper, over many years -- relatively well known systems of infection prevention control in care homes where it is well exercised. And I think that's another issue.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just looking at that on its own, though, that's not enough, is it, to give the care homes the guidance, the clarity, the information that they would have needed facing the type of situation that is described in your email?

**Dame Harries**: So I think there was other guidance that was published alongside this as far as I remember, and the guidance was updated very regularly. I do think there was a problem in the sense of ensuring -- and I think I flagged this in my email somewhere, which is I think that the NHS and social care should be seen as a total continuum. They are all part of the healthcare system, and sometimes one bit gets developed separate from another and you can -- I know, looking back at some of these, you can see that a piece of NHS guidance pops out and then somebody else is trying to ramp up with it.

So at the time for the patients who were being discharged, for the background epidemiology, it is probably reasonable, but, as I say, that progressed, the guidance progressed as we went forward.

I'm really keen to emphasise my email was a high-level view so people were aware of what was kind of coming over the hill, but the hill was still a little way away.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right. Let me ask you about a separate but related issue, Professor, and actually, for this purpose let's briefly go to Professor Van-Tam's paper.

So it's INQ000269388, please, and it's page 3.

We can see if we look at the very bottom of the left-hand column and then read over to the top of the right-hand column, the paper draws attention to a very particular problem in care homes which, again I understand from your earlier answer, was equally well known, it says:

"Although the role of asymptomatic people and those with only mild symptoms in spreading influenza [in that case] is uncertain, [healthcare workers] often continue to work despite having symptoms and may act as a source of infection to those in their care."

There is a reference to a Swedish study where nursing home aides are shown to be:

"... the occupational group at significantly greatest risk of continuing to work despite the feeling that, in light of their perceived state of health, they should have taken sick leave ... in reality the employment status of many ... staff is often precarious and taking unpaid sick leave may result in adverse economic consequences."

You're nodding, Professor. Was this another equally well known aspect of the healthcare risks associated with care homes, nursing homes and the like?

**Dame Harries**: Yes, I shall have to make sure I stick to my professional -- I mean, the health -- the social care sector, as I've said, I think, is under-recognised. There are more people employed in it, I think around 25% -- sorry, more people employed than in the health service, is my understanding. Around 25% of them, I think, are on zero hours contract. Many of them, the majority are women --

**Counsel Inquiry**: First, can I just interrupt you. Could I ask you to try to speak a little more slowly.

**Dame Harries**: I will do, sorry.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

**Dame Harries**: You can tell that I care passionately about this.

Therefore, when you want to manage situations of infection control, it's really important -- it's similar, actually, in some other industries, some other settings, for example, like food factories, I'm not suggesting these are the same but this same issue, of people working in poorer circumstances who cannot afford to take the time away from their work. And often it's compounded because both halves of the couple, for example, will not be able to. And if their children are at home, they are not receiving free meals, they can't do that either.

There is a whole sequence of social events which, for very understandable reasons in those families, would predicate to people either continuing to work, which of course is a risk to those for whom they're caring, or for things like, I think, you know, not staying in confinement, or isolation.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So the problem is and, I think on your evidence, was well understood at the time?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we focus then on that email of yours, and I'm simply using it as a way into this discussion --

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- we understand it was an internal email, but with the prospect, then, of discharging into care homes infectious patients, of course one risk is that they themselves might spread the infection to other patients, we've talked about that, but there was just as much a risk that healthcare workers would come into contact with them and then the workers would go on to spread the infection, either within that home or indeed in another care home. Do you think that that side of the risk was sufficiently understood and sufficiently accommodated in 2020?

**Dame Harries**: I think it was understood. I think it's difficult to quantify. And I would also add, part of the problem here is that, at the end of the day, my view is, care workers are often absolutely critical in individuals' lives, they're the one person who is standing by them at their frailest moment, and there aren't many of them around. And there comes a point where you say -- and we did see this for, in a few occasions in the pandemic, where the workforce capacity was insufficient to care for the individuals.

So if I just paint a picture, perhaps, where you have care workers who may be a risk -- and the evidence suggests they were doing a fabulous job but they were bringing in, as the majority ingress route into care homes, infection -- that you can't just exclude everybody, and people who -- because you lose the capacity to continue. And one of the biggest risks was care workers. So maybe a nurse, for example, working in the acute sector who then goes and does a night in a nursing care home and then goes on and does a bit of domiciliary work, and you can see the infection tracking round.

But just saying "Stay in one place" immediately means you've lost two capacity points in your health and care system.

**Counsel Inquiry**: That is a description of the problem --

**Dame Harries**: Yes, it is, I agree.

**Counsel Inquiry**: My question is, in this emergency situation, whereas you tell us these risks were understood, was enough done to try to mitigate that problem?

**Dame Harries**: So I think the problem was understood. The reason I explained the problem is because it's a very, very difficult one to solve. Because if you just isolate care workers completely and clamp down on everything, a care home might fall over, if you like, if you have got somebody working in two care homes.

So I think the care workers were given strong advice, they were encouraged to stay away from work. Clearly, as the pandemic went on, very strong testing procedures were put in -- and that was really helpful -- and then, in addition, payment funds. I mean, quite apart from the infection prevention control, payment to care workers to support them to self-isolate was also put in.

So the problem was recognised and it was dealt with, but the precarious state of the care workforce was a problem through the pandemic.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm going to leave it there, Professor, and move on and ask you about another issue, equally hotly debated, and that's of :outline:`face coverings`.

Can we start, please, by going to your witness statement at paragraph 8.125.

We will note here, paragraph 8.125, and then we'll look at the next paragraph as well, and the Inquiry has heard a fair amount of evidence about this, that the advice provided by the Office of the Chief Medical Officer on the use of :outline:`face coverings` -- which developed during the pandemic, did it not?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But you say here that as it developed it reflected the developing scientific understanding at any given time. You say:

"The initial position was that outside healthcare settings, the use of face-coverings for people who did not have COVID-19 in community settings was unlikely to have a significant impact and was not recommended ..." and you give references to NERVTAG and so on, and then also a reference to SAGE.

If we can go on to look at the next paragraph, please, you say that:

"Later in the pandemic, as the transmission characteristics of the virus became better understood ... there was a growing emphasis on the use of face-coverings as a precautionary tool ..."

In the next sentence you say:

"The evidence base for their use in community settings was, and still is to some degree, uncertain."

Professor, is it fair to say that your own personal view in fact remained that there wasn't any convincing evidence that :outline:`face coverings`. that is not sort of PPE used in healthcare settings, but the sort of home-made, if you like, fabric :outline:`face coverings` used in community settings, that there wasn't any convincing evidence that they were helpful?

**Dame Harries**: Not all the way through, no, and depending on what sort of face covering you had -- and this is the problem with the evidence, because much of the evidence -- there was a Lancet paper that was very heavily awaited during the pandemic -- was predominantly papers not in community settings or -- it was very difficult to dissociate the effectiveness of the face covering from other infection prevention control or NPIs. So I think that's why we have a difficult evidence base.

There is a stronger evidence base about the actual material, if you like. So if you have a one or two layer cloth, thin cloth covering, the evidence is: not particularly effective. If you have -- I have my colleague Jonathan Van-Tam's words ringing in my ear, he always refers to army ones, but a kind of -- a 12 layer, I think he calls it "duck material" or something, but, you know, it's a different sort of barrier.

So even within the face covering there's a difference. If somebody doesn't wear it appropriately, it won't work. But I think the WHO advice actually, I think it was around the beginning of July, changed and I think that was around the right time, where -- where you're starting to see is more recognition of the likelihood, still unquantified, of the asymptomatic transmission, and the opportunity therefore to -- the evidence starts to move in a more positive way.

But I think there's also a difference between, which I think the CMO put in his report potentially, around mandation, recommendation, guidance and allowing people to do what they want to do. And of course anybody could always wear a face covering if they wanted to, nobody was stopped. I think this issue is around which direction is the evidence travelling.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let me show you a couple of documents, Professor, and then ask you a question about them. They do cover that period that you've just been describing.

So first of all if we could look at INQ000069151.

So this is a document -- the date of it, it's not on the document, but it's from May of 2020, and it's some draft guidance, as we can see, how to wear and make a cloth face covering.

If we can go to the third page of it, please, I think what we see on the sidelining is that you've commented -- made various comments. No doubt it wasn't you who did the first draft. But what we see on the top comment here, in relation to a -- the draft saying -- talking about putting two squares of fabric on top of each other to make the :outline:`mask`, you say:

"Just querying the logic behind needing to have two pieces of cotton fabric stacked on this version but only a single layer of cotton t-shirt in the previous model... I think they are both ineffective so am not unduly worried but someone might want to think of an answer for the Q&As."

So there you are in May expressing a view that, frankly, these home made :outline:`cloth face masks`, one layer, two layer, are ineffective?

**Dame Harries**: Because the evidence at the time said at least three layers. So I didn't draft this guidance. My point was the guidance -- there were two points about this. The first one was I'm querying the logic, because if I was a member of the public and looked at that I'd think: why on earth do you want one layer here and two there? That was one point. The reason I said "I think [it's] ineffective" was because the only evidence I think we had at the time was around three layers, which actually started to give a bit of a positive impact. So I don't think that is effective.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well --

**Dame Harries**: If they'd said three, I'd have said, "Okay, but make the guidance consistent".

**Counsel Inquiry**: Professor, if there was evidence at the time that three layers was effective but one or two wasn't, why didn't you say, "We should be telling people to use three layers"?

**Dame Harries**: Well, I'm not sure I even knew where this had come from. You have to bear in mind that this will come to me from somewhere else. Often I would get given pieces of guidance that said, "This is what somebody has decided to do as policy, now make it the best you can". So I may have read that one as: this is what we're going to say, and I think this is an example.

So I've said, "I don't think this is effective, I think the public -- it doesn't feel logical as a communication to me, and if that's therefore what you want to do, work through it".

I think people would have known, probably, at the time what the evidence was. PHE were continuously providing -- reviewing the evidence on the use of :outline:`face coverings`. In fact predominantly at the time I think it was my colleague Jonathan Van-Tam.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let me just --

**Dame Harries**: But can I just go back on that? Because actually this was May and I think this was probably the period -- it was coming just after, certainly in the UK, where we'd had the Easter 6 studies and various other things, and it was still not at this point -- I mean, WHO was still not recommending :outline:`face coverings`.

So we'd got a position here -- I mean, maybe I was a little bit annoyed, you know, I can see it in the tone there, but where there wasn't a clear policy and yet I was being sent a document to sign off something which I didn't think was very evidence-based. But that was not an infrequent occurrence.

**Lady Hallett**: Professor, I understand the need for having an evidence base -- I would, given my background -- and I understand that you would have preferred three layers because you had the evidence for three layers --

**Dame Harries**: Well, the evidence with three layers was not very strong.

**Lady Hallett**: Right, well, okay, let's forget about how many layers. Is there any harm in -- I appreciate buying :outline:`masks` may interfere with supply to care home workers and people working in hospitals -- is there any harm in encouraging members of the public to use :outline:`home-made face masks`?

**Dame Harries**: I mean, this is where it gets, I think -- because the evidence at this point is quite tricky, I think once we got past -- I mean, as I say, I think WHO changed their guidance in July. They were not -- we haven't got the date of this document.

So I think where you've got a very low evidence base, it hadn't, I don't think, shifted at that point, we didn't have the evidence, and still don't, about asymptomatic transmission. The evidence is definitely there, is strong now, but the quantification of it is quite poor, and therefore understanding the size of effect of this is quite tricky, and this will be a government document effectively. Again, not for me to decide, but there's quite a difference between mandating, recommending -- if a government recommends something that's quite a strong position -- encouraging -- and actually if you encourage or support and you're in a government position, that's almost taken as recommending, and it's quite difficult to do that when the evidence is not strong because you will then end up with people challenging other ones.

So you tend to see where it moves to and there -- but the other issue here is, if I just point out, you said: are there any other things? We've got all sorts of safety issues here as well, and one of the problems in May, and this might be related to this as well, was when -- it might show my irritation -- was when there were a lot of discussions about coming out of lockdown, opening up the economy and various other things, and the 2-metre/1-metre. I think this was landing just about the same time as the 1 metre plus issue, and the problem we had there was that there appeared to be a view permeating through and a real concern and risk that it was being conceived that if you did 1 metre and you wore a face covering flung round your cheek or whatever it might be, that was fine. And so there was a risk that in encouraging :outline:`face coverings` people would stop doing the thing which was really important, which was distancing and all the other things. So this may have been coming on the back of that. I suspect it was.

**Lady Hallett**: So the risk of there being a false sense of security?

**Dame Harries**: Yes, a false sense of security. But it was actually also overlapping with what was economically driven policy, I think, to try to remove some of the distancing rules.

So it was, you will have seen, I think, in the evidence, I think it's about this time, with Jonathan Van-Tam and myself, where we were trying to really highlight what we thought about the 2-metre and 1 metre rule discussions, and what was being conceived was, if you wear a face covering and reduce everything to a metre, the face covering will make up for the difference. And the answer was: no, it won't, and it definitely won't if it's not evidence-based.

**Mr O'Connor**: Well, in fact that was the point I was planning to come to, Professor.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry if I interfered.

**Mr O'Connor**: No, but it's the point about false sense of security.

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What we are seeing here is draft guidance on making a mask, which will of course make people feel more confident to go out, go on public transport, whatever, which you are saying is ineffective. Wasn't that a reason to say, "No, we shouldn't be encouraging people to use these :outline:`ineffective masks`"?

**Dame Harries**: That's a very difficult balance, for the point we've just come back to, because the first question was: shouldn't you be encouraging this, there's no harm? And the issue for me at that time, and I think Professor Van-Tam shared it, was we definitely shouldn't be supporting something which was not evidence-based if it was going to promote a risk compensation. And there were a number of different driving factors here and of course :outline:`face coverings`. as I know you'll be aware, is a wholly polarised debate and it's quite difficult to maintain a central position.

I -- you know, if you -- if I'd said, "Don't do any of this", somebody would have challenged back and said, "Well, you know, surely there's no harm", my main concern was it was being put in -- it would have been conceived as a safer way of moving about, just when we've got through the first tragic wave of the pandemic.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And did you do something about that concern?

**Dame Harries**: Yes, well, on the 1-metre/2-metre, and I think this is -- I may be getting my timeframes mixed up but I think this is very much around the same time that the CMO, CSA and two Deputy CMOs wrote to Simon Case, because it was around lifting all the different industries and businesses and sectors at the same time, and the anxiety was that if people just thought they could get a bit of T-shirt, put it round their face and that would solve all the problems and we could go back to normal, that was not going to be a good public health intervention.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

Professor, lastly I want to ask you about a different matter altogether, and it relates to your current role with the UKHSA and some evidence that Sir Patrick Vallance gave, Sir Patrick Vallance, when he was in the box last week.

He was talking about how the country might best prepare for a future pandemic, and he talked about his idea of a need for something that he described as an academic centre for pandemic preparedness, in terms of trying to bring together, in one or more academic institution, all the different fields of expertise that might be relevant to preparing for a pandemic, whether it's modelling or testing :outline:`masks` or the whole range of expertise.

When I asked him whether that was something that the government should be involved in, he said yes, he thought it should have government funding, and indeed that he thought the UKHSA, your organisation, should be involved in that enterprise.

What's your view about all of that?

**Dame Harries**: So I think Sir Patrick and I are looking at it from slightly different lenses, but the broad answer is yes. And in fact it is in my planning.

But what we have at the moment, just by way of description, is a number of different universities across the country have set up their own pandemic institutes, or words to that effect. We are linked to them on an individual basis and they link with each other.

The vision from my lens is that they have a network. They all have brilliant academic work ongoing routinely. We are sitting almost at the interface between government and academia, and so in peacetime, when we're not all responding to something, then we can be identifying between us what pieces of research work need to go ahead, there's opportunities to link with the National Institute for Health Research and funding opportunities, so we're all aligned on what the priorities are. And then at a time of need actually the institute -- the global institutes are all there to work through and with UKHSA, working into the pandemic response, you know, for government.

And it wouldn't just be for pandemics. If you thought about something like the Mpox epidemic recently, then it's a great opportunity to do that.

The only thing I would say is I think Sir Patrick suggested, and I notice Graham Medley said, well, they were expecting PHE to be doing a lot of the work for SAGE. In fact PHE was doing a lot of the work, it was going in on individual names to NERVTAG, and then the NERVTAG paper would go to SAGE. And so a lot of the academic work has not been recognised of PHE colleagues and I would just like to pull that out.

But --

**Counsel Inquiry**: That's a comment about the last pandemic?

**Dame Harries**: It is, but on this one, now, there are health protection research units, they've actually just been refunded, we have a lot of people who -- I call them "twin hats", so they work part time in the UK Health Security Agency, they work in academia, and the Health Protection Research Units can do very rapid evidence reviews or research programmes. Many of the urgent research work that was done through the pandemic is done through those.

So my shorter answer is, to be helpful, I absolutely agree with Sir Patrick. We are trying to do the same approach with industry so that we're ready to, you know, create vaccines, look at therapeutics. I think there is a partially set up system already. We have our own Centre for Pandemic Preparedness, which is designed as the building block to link with academia already. It is not funded longer term but nevertheless we have prioritised trying to put it together because we also think it's really critical.

So I think it's a version of what Sir Patrick has mentioned and I think we've started to build it already, so we perhaps just -- I'd perhaps need to swap notes with Sir Patrick so we've got a consolidated view.

**Mr O'Connor**: Thank you very much, Professor, those are all my questions.

**Lady Hallett**: Just before we go to the questions from core participants, Professor Harries, you talked about lessons learned; have you thought of a list of lessons that --

**Dame Harries**: So I think I put three in my statement, one is very much around data, one is around science and the value and the value of the scientists, and the third one is inevitably, you will see, around social care.

If I work backwards, I don't think we can have a responsive health system, health and wellbeing system, if the value of social care is not recognised and the value of the workers is not recognised. As I look forward, planning for pandemics, the very same frail individuals who are sitting in residential care settings now or learning disabled, wherever they may be in the community, are the same people I need to reach each time there is an infectious disease incident. And so that should be much better planned for on a systematic basis, and I think social care workers should have parity. That's not how it's been seen.

The second point I think is around data. There are a number of reasons why data appeared to flow slowly, probably not for going into the detail here, but there should definitely be a transparency of data. But we also need to engender trust, I think, in people sharing data. One of the problems, for example, with ethnicity is, yes, people aren't looking to collect it, that's a problem for researchers for government, but also people need -- you know, we need to enable them to feel trust, that they trust us to share that data so that we can actually get the granular level of information to support them.

Then the third one is, although we are a responsed organisation for infectious disease, we also have a significant scientific element. As scientists, they're just not recognised, they're sitting at the back of this. Every time somebody uses a point of care test, it will have been validated at UKHSA Porton Down. Every single vaccination programme is -- there is a whole pathway, no vaccination programme in this country is running without colleagues working at UKHSA Colindale and across the UKHSA generally. These are quite hidden scientific tasks and we -- one of my problems actually in setting up the organisation is having funding for a year, not having that -- you know, a scientist has a ten-year career ahead, and you need to do three years of research, and that needs to be really, really embedded and then we can take forward our work with industry as well, I think, and work with them.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

Mr Wilcock.

Questions From Mr Wilcock KC

**Mr Wilcock**: Professor, good morning. I'm going to ask you some questions on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice campaign, and I think you've had advance notice of the areas that we wish to cover, and they really deal with your involvement in UKHSA, which you've just been talking about.

Yesterday you told us that you became chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency in April 2021, and that that body became fully operational in October of the same year, and that the UKHSA took on much of the health protection areas that had previously been the responsibility of Public Health England.

The Inquiry has heard expert evidence from Professor Ailsa Henderson of Edinburgh University that, despite the name change, which was designed to enhance clarity about the territorial extent of the role UKHSA played, the body still has, in her words, a predominantly English focus, using and analysing English data, and therefore framing an English framework in response.

Can you see the force in those observations?

**Dame Harries**: I probably should just declare at this moment, I'm a Welsh resident, when we get into questions of four nations, so I look from both angles. I trained and I live in Wales.

**Mr Wilcock KC**: Well, we'll forgive you that.

**Dame Harries**: So I didn't choose the name.

There are clearly huge advantages of working across the UK, but in -- in relation to things like pandemic response, and I absolutely welcome what is actually very, very close working particularly with the CMOs and Deputy CMOs, but also with the health professionals in the different health protection agencies. It's a very, very positive working arrangement. They happen naturally.

However, I think there are points that have been made, and they're recurrent points, and so I'd look at them in two ways.

One is the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which I think was welcomed by -- I didn't set it up and I wasn't -- it was welcomed by other UK nations, had a formal agreement, and that agreement is maintained, it was agreed by the health ministers, and then there is a working level board sitting underneath that.

We also have a separate UKHSA devolved nations board, and in fact it met yesterday, as routinely, it's chaired by my director general for strategy and policy, and that met in Edinburgh.

So I think that in itself should signal the steps that we were trying take to try to maintain it.

When it comes to data, it gets very, very much more difficult. So, for example, we saw discrepancies -- I'm part -- I was expecting somebody to ask me about QCovid and shielding and various other things, but a QCovid tool, for example, we had in England and we had in Wales, we didn't have in Scotland. That's not because people weren't working together, it's because the systems are different and each country has its own health protection agency and is responsible for its own health protection response, except for some matters of global health security when we do represent the UK Government and therefore we are UK. So it's quite a complex setting.

There is also -- I mean, I can see this from the Welsh lens as well, having sat there. There's often a requirement or an ask, and we welcome in those colleagues -- you know, there are incident meetings running now and every nation is involved, but the data belongs to those nations and if it is not provided to us we cannot put it on various websites.

I actually tried last night to put in my own postcode into the dashboard, to see what happens, and I can pull up my own data, but it's not a landing page for Wales, for example. And Wales has some great scientists, they collaborate with us, but it's not a one-way flow.

And I think the other thing is there's often an ask, which we've heard through the pandemic -- through the Inquiry -- for people -- you know, "Have you got somebody from Wales, have you got somebody from England?" on a particular group. But if you want -- it doesn't work the other way round. So there's an expectation everybody will come to England, but not that England will be allowed to go to every nation. So I think that's not -- you know, as I say, we work brilliantly with many colleagues and hugely grateful for their support, their particularly good input to the Social Care Working Group, but it's something that I'd think is not a one-sided picture, and we need to work through how we can improve that.

**Mr Wilcock KC**: So would it be a fair summary of that answer: it's a complex problem, you see some force in what the professor says and you're trying to put in --

**Dame Harries**: Absolutely.

**Mr Wilcock KC**: All right.

Now, I think you might have touched on the next questions I'm going to ask you, because some of the families I represent have noticed that if they go on to the UKHSA website there is no reference to Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales on the website, and nor does the website direct readers from those parts of the UK to the equivalent services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Are you able to confirm that that is the case, and if so why would that be the case?

**Dame Harries**: Well, again, this is one of those areas where it needs both angles, really. So I think if I was sitting, let's -- if I'm sitting in Wales working as part of the health system in Wales, I think they expect residents to track on to their system. And, you know, similarly we had -- I know there have been comments about press briefings, for example, over the pandemic, but of course each country also had its own press briefing. So it gets quite difficult.

I would like to -- we're still quite a young organisation. I would like us, with the very strong support of other health protection agencies, to make sure that, as a minimum, we have the links operating across and we're directing people. Because at the end of the day we're all here to protect the public and if they can't actually work their way round this very complex system, none of us are doing a very good job.

**Mr Wilcock KC**: Understood. Let me just rewind a little bit. Presumably this concentration on English-focused data also existed during the pandemic?

**Dame Harries**: So that -- you know, the data -- so the health service for data, for example, for Wales -- I'm using Wales simply because I'm very familiar with it -- but it's owned by Wales, it's not our data. As I think we heard from Professor McLean last week, possibly, DSTL actually helped, in the early phase, get some of that data together, and she gave some reasons as so why it was easier for that organisation to do it than others, but it needs both the will of -- the trust, I think, of each nation to share that data. And it does get very sensitive. It happens within the UK as well. Because for something -- I'm going to be quite outspoken here -- as politically sensitive as the National Health Service and its efficiency in all nations, that can be quite a challenging thing to do.

**Mr Wilcock KC**: Was anything else done to try to rectify those problems apart from what you've just told us Dr McLean --

*(unclear: multiple speakers)*

**Dame Harries**: Yes, so -- so on the -- through the pandemic obviously the dashboard actually did give different country data as well, so we did accumulate it, and I think it was shown, if I remember, at the Number 10 press briefings, for example, you could see some of the -- and it was looked at routinely and colleagues from the four nations also reviewed. So when, for example, gold and silver committees were meeting, what have you, it would have input from all the different nations.

But what we're displaying where needs agreement across all four nations, but certainly from my perspective it would be much better if we had more sharing. I live on the border, so I'm a resident who wants to see and know what's happening around me.

**Mr Wilcock KC**: So finally can we assume, therefore, that if the UKHSA is to remain a UK-wide agency, you accept that more can and should be done to try to consider and reflect the UK-wide position rather than --

**Dame Harries**: Within the remit which we are given, which is not -- you know, it's to respect and work with, you know, the Health Protection Agencies --

**Mr Wilcock KC**: Not instead of --

*(unclear:multiple speakers)*

**Dame Harries**: -- we don't have a control over that.

**Mr Wilcock**: Thank you very much.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Wilcock.

Mr Friedman.

Questions From Mr Friedman KC

**Mr Friedman**: Professor Harries, I act for four national disabled peoples' organisations.

You have explained in detail in your written and oral evidence that there were foreseeable risks, I think the words used today are "normal things to think about if you're public health trained". That social and health inequalities would produce adverse outcomes for people in terms of the virus itself and in terms of its countermeasures, and that would include disabled people.

The question is this: why do you think now, with the benefit of hindsight, there was so little government planning for that?

**Dame Harries**: That's -- I think I look this way, is that right?

**Mr Friedman KC**: Please face away from me to the Chair.

**Dame Harries**: So there was a lot of planning and I don't think -- I wouldn't wish the Inquiry to think there was no planning at all, but I do think we can do better. One of the things which actually I think is very positive in this regard, which I was personally involved with, and which the CMO started, was the tool called QCovid, which I've just highlighted. The shielding programme was -- I think has had a quite difficult birth and utilisation, because people have used the word "shielding" -- we've heard "segmentation", we've heard "shielding", we've heard "cocooning". From my perspective there were two elements to it. The part I was involved with, which was very definitely, clumsy words, but to distinguish clinically extremely vulnerable and clinically vulnerable, that was to identify people with diseases some of whom will have disability in higher arrays. And then there were other vulnerabilities, some of which will have been disabilities, some of which will have been financial disabilities, if you like, you know -- so -- so there were -- the -- there was the difficult mix, I think, across -- between the clinical provision and recognition and the work which was ongoing in local government.

But I think there's an opportunity for us to actually get that better aligned, and what we did do, I think -- I think it was Michael Marmot in the first Inquiry said that nobody had actually -- it was all clinical and nobody had put the rest of it together. Actually that's not correct at all. What we did do was, at the first round, if you like, thought: who do we think is clinically vulnerable? And that will include quite a lot of people with existing disabilities. And then we went on, having started that shielding programme, to develop a weighted cumulative risk tool. It's called QCovid. But without going into the detail of it, it was for two reasons. It was to ensure that people could have a conversation about their own risk, and it was to ensure that we had captured as best we could the intersectionality of the problems that people might have.

Now, some of these will include disability, so the one that I particularly call out, for example, is learning disability, and that tool also included socioeconomic deprivation and ethnicity. As best we could. And so through that we actually added on a significant number to the shielding patient list, so not just for clinical reasons but for many others, and we also raised -- moved up a lot of people into the group 4 for the JCVI vaccination as soon as that was through.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Thank you, I'm just going to come in there, and in due course we'll go through the timeline with the Chair on the documents, but I think you know very well that as of March, and let us say 16 March for instance, because you looked at very difficult emails to look at now, where you had to give very high-level realistic advice, you've explained something that was developed, and I think you know, from July into September and into the autumn of 2020, I'm not asking you about that.

I'm asking, and maybe you disagree with the premise, but we rather thought it was clear from your statements, that normal things to think about if you were public trained were not normal things that government as a whole was thinking about as of mid-March 2020, and the question is: why do you think now, with the benefit of hindsight, that there was so little thinking about that across government at that time?

**Dame Harries**: I would say, I certainly -- having worked in local authorities, I think local government definitely thinks about it --

*(unclear: multiple speakers)*

**Mr Friedman KC**: But I'm asking you about central government, which is --

**Dame Harries**: I agree, but I'm not sure I can answer that question in that way, because I ... it's not a -- I'd be asked for advice and I would give that willingly. It's not an area that would be -- directly involve me.

I mean, I know right at the start of the pandemic the Minister for Care asked for reports, as soon as there was any evidence, that could be used around disability. The data is quite difficult. And of course something like -- I think it's 65% of those over 65 will have disabilities. So to some extent they were already being thought through in the shielding programme.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Thank you.

Just on that shielding programme, the meetings from early March adopted a two-tier approach to shielding, and you've explained there was some baggage in the label, we understand that, and there were going to be different degrees of clinical vulnerability.

Now, was there a foreseeable risk that those in the second tier, however one defines it, would be de-prioritised in being able to access basic services such as food and healthcare services, access to which was explicitly linked, initially, to being within the first tier, clinically extremely vulnerable cohort?

**Dame Harries**: I might not have quite understood the question. So Tier 1 is --

**Mr Friedman KC**: CEV --

**Dame Harries**: Yeah, okay.

**Mr Friedman KC**: And they got an automatic package --

**Dame Harries**: Yeah.

**Mr Friedman KC**: -- and CV didn't?

**Dame Harries**: The important thing here is that shielding, as I think Professor Whitty said, is not -- I mean, basically there isn't a magic bullet here. It's somebody is advised (and totally for them to do, completely voluntarily, this is not the sort of segmentation policy that I think is described elsewhere) to go into isolation almost.

And so it is, firstly, for them to choose whether they do that. Always has been.

For those who are in the clinically vulnerable group, the wider one, then there was the -- obviously it's a much wider group, we recognised that we couldn't contact all of those people centrally. It wasn't feasible. And for the reasons which I've just said, that intersectionality of risks was very much something for local government. So it's not something that was handled in that way.

So there were funding -- there were -- to local authorities. But I think you'd need to direct that conversation to somebody from that department.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Understood, but conceptually, as it were, at the central level --

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Mr Friedman KC**: -- reliance was going to have to be placed on the effectiveness or otherwise at the local government level?

**Dame Harries**: I think that's right. And, I mean, local government do -- they run, and I'm sure you're aware, they're registered -- they will know where their local communities are who need support and those people sort of running between both a clinical risk and, you know, a financial or mobility risk.

**Mr Friedman KC**: We can look at that in due course, and we've heard what you've said about social care and the lessons learned about that and the parity that's needed now that perhaps wasn't there then.

But staying with those who were regarded as clinically vulnerable, and with what degree of risk, may I end by asking you about Down's Syndrome. I think you were on notice that we wanted to ask you about this, and we've got quite specific questions, if you could assist us on them.

The first is this -- it's levelled at March 2020, I'm going to go on in the chronology, so the first one is: bearing in mind that respiratory disorders are a predominant cause of death for people with Down's Syndrome, should they have been designated in a higher category of risk from March 2020?

**Dame Harries**: So, we had to look at what was likely to be a risk factor at the start.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: So I don't think there was any suggestion of perfection in that.

**Mr Friedman KC**: No.

**Dame Harries**: The QCovid tool was designed to enhance that. Not everybody with what you might think -- and I think, was it Professor Brightling said this earlier -- would -- you know, some of the things we found did not work out. So, you know, for example we thought people with asthma might be particularly affected, you'd think respiratory disease -- actually that wasn't -- for most people that wasn't it, and they could come off the list.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: So for Down's Syndrome it's not that -- there was very little signal to start with. So there is a logic and there is a potential logic for a number of conditions.

What we did do was monitor these things. So there was a four nations -- goes back to colleague -- the question earlier, there was a four nations UK clinical panel, which I chaired. In fact the signal from Down's Syndrome was raised by NERVTAG, I think, so --

**Mr Friedman KC**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: -- time for it to come through, around May.

We asked the clinical lead for the NHS to bring forward a paper, and all of the clinical leads for that UK panel met and reviewed it.

Now, at the time, there wasn't sufficient granularity in that information to be able to see a signal, but there was a process of bringing things back. And a couple of months later --

**Mr Friedman KC**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: -- there was a signal through and immediately people -- all the Down's Syndrome people were moved onto the shielded patient list.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Well, thanks, you've gone ahead a little bit. I'm just going to break that down a little bit, because that's what I'm going to ask you about.

We know -- I hope you'll just take this from me -- we know as a matter of record that Down's Syndrome was not added to the CEV list until early November, it's about 2 November --

**Dame Harries**: Yes, although --

**Mr Friedman KC**: Can I just set the context for you and tell me if you disagree.

You've explained to the Chair, as we understood it to be, that the matter made it to the NERVTAG clinical subgroup. It's actually first at the beginning of June and then going to a second meeting at the end of June, 29 June, where they indicate on the basis of modelling that there appears to be a high risk, but they want more work to be done, and they pass that up the line, as you've just summarised to the Chair.

So we've got to 29 June, and then there is a decision that goes before the Covid-O group as of 1 October that is indicating that the work has now been done and the recommendation is there in the pipeline, and then we have, as it were, this letter to the GPs and other stakeholders. That was 2 November.

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Mr Friedman KC**: So we've got a very specific question on that, which is: how could such a delay in adding people to the Down's Syndrome CEV list have been avoided? How could it have been done quicker? Now we know what we know and, as of 2 November, what had to be done had to be done, how could it have been quicker?

**Dame Harries**: So number one, just for clarity, if a GP felt that somebody with Down's Syndrome for some specific reason, because many will have other conditions, so epilepsy for example, needed to be on the list --

**Mr Friedman KC**: We take that.

**Dame Harries**: -- they could go on. But on your particular point, I think I tried to explain, obviously very badly, that in that intervening period the detail had been looked at. It had come to the clinical panel, it had been presented to the UK CMOs, the signal wasn't there at that time. And as more data came through, it went back again in September, and we immediately acted on it because we could see that the signal then for Down's Syndrome was high, and then all of the Down's Syndrome adults were put on the shielded patient list.

So it's not that there was no activity, there was actually a systematic approach to looking at the evidence.

**Mr Friedman KC**: We understand that. The point of it is that the paper in September showed a ten-fold increased risk for people with Down's Syndrome.

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Mr Friedman KC**: That's a very significant risk. That's a paper in September. The CEV moment is 2 November --

**Dame Harries**: So I think --

**Mr Friedman KC**: I mean, I think you're trying to tell the Chair you went quickly, in your view. My question is: how could it have been done quicker? Your answer may be it couldn't have been, but that's the question.

**Dame Harries**: So there is a process -- I've got a date here of 9 October when I think the process for moving the people onto the list started, so there is a digital process to do that.

The other point was, I think, just for reassurance for those individuals, that was, of course, the time when no shielding was in process, so I think what we were trying to ensure was individuals were on that for the list going -- it had been paused over the summer because of the lower prevalence rates.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

That's enough, Mr Friedman, sorry, thank you.

Mr Thomas.

Questions From Professor Thomas KC

**Professor Thomas**: Professor Harries, good morning. I represent FEHMO, the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations. As you probably know, FEHMO represents and advocates for the interests of workers from ethnic minority communities at all levels within the health and social care sector across the UK.

I'm going to be making reference to your fourth witness statement, but I'm not going to call it up, but just for the record, and for her Ladyship, the relevant paragraphs are paragraphs 9.38 and 9.40.

Here's what I wish to explore, and let me just set out a little bit of context, and I don't have much for you. During the pandemic, when the NHS was overwhelmed, care homes were meeting deficit in terms of the NHS's ability to care for often elderly people, some of whom were dying and would ordinarily be in hospital. You would agree, I'm sure, that that situation would have had a significant impact on care homes. Can we agree on that?

**Dame Harries**: Sorry, I'm not being awkward. Can we just go back?

**Professor Thomas KC**: Of course.

**Dame Harries**: So I would expect anybody who would normally be in hospital would be in hospital unless there was a reason not to. I may have misheard. Could you just go back one and then I'll ...

**Professor Thomas KC**: Of course. I'm suggesting to you that the NHS was overwhelmed --

**Dame Harries**: Yep.

**Professor Thomas KC**: -- and care homes were meeting the deficit at times in terms of some of the NHS's ability to care for often elderly people, some of whom were dying and would ordinarily be in hospital. That's the proposition I put to you. Do you accept that or don't you?

**Dame Harries**: I would hope that, except in extreme circumstances, they would be in hospital, that it should be preserved for those will be benefiting from that. But I agree that the whole system was under stress.

**Professor Thomas KC**: All right. In the light of the unique challenges posed by the global pandemic and the national emergency it represents, I'm sure you'll also agree that central government should bear significant responsibility for ensuring that the safety and wellbeing of its care home workers, especially considering their frontline roles being in an overstretched public service; would you agree with that?

**Dame Harries**: I mean, I think that is a question for the government, the minister, rather than me as a medical professional. To answer. But, having said that, I think -- I suspect the statements that I've made earlier suggest that I, as a public health professional, am very much in support of ensuring that the care staff are recognised.

**Professor Thomas KC**: Is that a yes?

**Dame Harries**: I think -- I don't think it's a question for me to answer on behalf of government. It feels like it's a ministerial question. That's the only reason I'm not commenting.

**Professor Thomas KC**: Well, the reason why I'm putting this to you is because something that you said in your statement at paragraph 9.38 -- and I'll put my second question to you. Would you accept this: given the critical nature of care home workers' roles, particularly during these extraordinary times like a global pandemic, it would become imperative for central government to take a more active and central role in overseeing and supporting the safety for carehome workers. Would you accept that?

**Dame Harries**: I agree and I think they did -- they certainly tried to. I also would flag, which is the point I've -- point in the lessons learned, which is the underlying system for care homes in this country is not one of central -- it's very different to the NHS.

**Professor Thomas KC**: Well, I'm going to come on to that because that is my final point, which is -- because you make this point, and this is again at paragraph 9.38 --

**Dame Harries**: Is it possible for me to see what I've said because I don't have it in front of me.

**Professor Thomas KC**: Will, I will come on -- is what you say. You say that:

"While recognising the private business model of care homes ... ", yes?

**Dame Harries**: Yep.

**Professor Thomas KC**: It's in front of you. You say, "While recognising the private business model of care homes ... "

Here's the point that I wish to put to you: surely we can agree that government decisions and policies during a national emergency can significantly impact the ability of care homes to protect their staff, manage PPE stock and ensure business continuity, thereby necessitating a more engaged from role from central government?

**Dame Harries**: Yeah. So I would just say I do think this is a question for government, not for a medical adviser. Of course I think the government would say -- and, I mean, I'm sort of answering your question indirectly -- that they have and that there was clearly a central role in the pandemic. But the point I was trying to make is probably the one which I think you're getting at, which is the model was not one that was established well enough to ensure that that central control happened effectively, and that I think is one of the points I've put in my lessons learned, because it is so critical because of the vulnerability of the population.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Thomas.

Ms Sergides.

Can you see Ms Sergides over there?

Questions From Ms Sergides

**Ms Sergides**: Do say if you can't see me.

**Dame Harries**: I can. Thank you.

**Ms Sergides**: I represent Southall Black Sisters and Solace Women's Aid and I will be asking you questions relating to domestic abuse as a public health matter and key workers.

So my first question is at paragraph 455 of your statement, dated 22 August 2023 -- I know you have done a few statements -- you say that on 16 March 2022, Public Health England explained that testing was being scaled up to focus on intensive care units, hospital admissions and testing for key workers. Did you have any involvement in defining key workers?

**Dame Harries**: I presume you mean 2020. I think you said 2022, but I presume this is the change in prioritisation.

**Ms Sergides**: 2020, I apologise.

**Dame Harries**: Not directly. I was engaged in discussions over the pandemic with things like testing for key workers, but very much from, at that stage, the technical advisory part of what would work. There were discussions across government but it was -- and they were right across all sectors, so I was in the room. I wasn't a key decider of who was in a key sector.

**Ms Sergides**: So although you weren't a key decider, as far as you are aware, were those working in refuge accommodation or domestic abuse charities prioritised for testing and, if so, when was that?

**Dame Harries**: I can't answer that one directly. I mean, there are two issues there about key workers and who was a frontline worker and then, sort of, the implementation of the testing programme. There was quite a lot of consideration, I think, in NHS Test and Trace -- again, I wasn't there at the time -- about where that risk lay and who needed to be tested. Obviously, there were many different use cases and there was a certain flexibility whilst working with directors of public health that if they wished to -- you know, if they could identify groups because it would, as you know, vary in different geographies that they could direct testing in those cases. But I think that's probably all I can say to help.

**Ms Sergides**: I'm going to turn to my second and last question. In his evidence to this Inquiry and in response to questions relating to interventions, NPIs. Sir Chris Whitty said that he is entitled, and should, weigh up the negative aspects from a public health view. He gave an example of people who go into shielding before needed and then end up with loneliness and depression and that these are clinical and public health problems.

I appreciate you've briefly touched upon this with Mr O'Connor but, given that domestic abuse and its impact on victims are public health issues, what should the government have considered in relation to domestic abuse when deciding social isolation and/or lockdown measures?

**Dame Harries**: Well, I think I probably have answered the question because in that particular case, to my mind, it is foreseeable and we can imagine what's going to happen and I think you will probably be representing people who experienced those increases in calls just beforehand.

And therefore I think some of the messaging was not as clear as it could have been to make sure that people understood that they could come out of isolation. There clearly was a course out and I think it was considered within that, I'm not sure that if I was somebody frightened, you know, in a domestic abuse situation and about to go into lockdown, that I would perhaps have clocked that the message that says "for an emergency" actually applied to me.

**Ms Sergides**: I'm grateful, Professor.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Sergides.

Mr Stanton.

Questions From Mr Stanton

**Mr Stanton**: Thank you, my Lady.

Good morning, Professor. I'll be asking a few questions on behalf of the British Medical Association. I'd like to ask your views about the response to the risk of :outline:`airborne transmission`, avoiding any duplication of this area when you were engaging with Mr O'Connor.

At paragraph 521 of your first statement in this module, you indicated that this risk was predictable in February 2020 but took some time to determine and, appreciating that the scientific understanding took some time to play out, can I ask you why a more precautionary approach wasn't taken to this risk from the outset?

**Dame Harries**: So I think we heard yesterday, I think, or from a previous witness the -- it was treated as an HCID to start with. I mean, that has a whole discussion in itself which I won't go into. So I think it was treated with a precautionary approach; that was correct.

And when I say it was foreseeable, I think it was because almost any respiratory virus we would expect it would be very difficult to not think through a whole continuum of going from, you know, :outline:`fomite`, :outline:`droplets` and :outline:`airborne:outline:`. The critical thing here is about the proportionality. So I think the right preventive element was put in to start with and it is a matter of the developing science as we've gone through which is very complex.

**Mr Stanton**: Thank you.

Thinking about the measures in place within healthcare settings, what prevented the provision of :outline:`FFP3 respirators` to healthcare workers who were treating patients with Covid-19?

**Dame Harries**: So I -- the guidance, as you will know, I'm sure, was reviewed multiple times, and continues to be as we have gone through. It's set by a four nations IPC cell, not by myself, not by Public Health England in those days, now UKHSA, and the operational implementation of that sits with NHS England.

So I can't -- I mean, there's a very, very complex review through that. It goes back to the risk and the evidence. So :outline:`FFP3s` were provided for :outline:`aerosol-generating procedures` right from the outset. That has always been there and it remains. We are back then to the balance of risks around appropriate PPE.

But I would just like to say that at all times when those reviews have happened they have linked across to see what WHO's recommending and have stayed consistent, I'm pretty confident on that. So I don't think -- I think one of the interesting things was :outline:`FFP3s` and :outline:`FFP2s` are used differentially in different countries. So, in fact, the :outline:`FFP3` that was in play right at the start of the pandemic is, if you like, in simplistic terms, a stronger recommendation than in many other countries and I think for some of the WHO guidance.

**Mr Stanton**: To what extent did cost and availability play a part in their provision?

**Dame Harries**: So again, as I said yesterday, I wasn't responsible for PPE. Obviously some of my team now input to the technical side of it. Cost was not an issue at all in any of these events; so that one is right out of the picture. But obviously there was a -- there was a global shortage. I mean, I think if every country in the world wants PPE, it's going to be difficult. So I think at times there was difficulty procuring.

That said, as I discussed yesterday, certainly early on we did have a very good national supply but obviously, as it was pulled on, and I think picking up the care provision, the predominant -- the pandemic preparedness PPE was predominantly, I think, originally focused on the healthcare, which goes back to my point about social care.

**Mr Stanton**: Thank you.

Lastly and very quickly, just picking up on some of the comments you made about the effectiveness of :outline:`masks` used in the general population, can I ask you your view of the effectiveness of fluid-resistant
 :outline:`surgical masks` for combating  :outline:`aerosol transmission`?

**Dame Harries**: So, I mean, that's quite a detailed technical question which is probably not for answering here and I'm happy to provide a written one on that. I mean, usually there is -- when you're working in a healthcare environment, often the fluid-resistance is therefore :outline:`splash protection` but obviously if the :outline:`splash protection` is critical, then you will actually have a shield as well. So, you know, that is quite a detailed answer. I'm very happy to provide one in writing.

**Mr Stanton**: Thank you, Professor.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Professor Harries. I wish I could say it's the last time we're going to call upon you, but I have a feeling that we'll be asking you to help us again. Thank you for your help.
