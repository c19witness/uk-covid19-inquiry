Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Ms Cowen**: Thank you, Mr Mason.

Could you please begin by giving us your full name, please.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, my full name is Toby Rhys Mason.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. Thank you for assisting the Inquiry, both through the provision of your witness statement and for attending today.

If I can please remind you, when answering questions, please keep your voice up and try to speak slowly so our stenographer is able to keep pace with your answers, thank you.

You have produced a witness statement for this module of the Inquiry. That witness statement is at INQ000340123 and that statement has been signed by you on 2 November 2023. Is this statement true to the best of your knowledge and belief?

**Mr Toby Mason**: It is.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Mr Mason, you were appointed as head of strategic communications for the Welsh Government in January 2014; is that right?

**Mr Toby Mason**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: To be clear, your role is not a political appointment, is it, you are in fact a civil servant?

**Mr Toby Mason**: That's correct, I am a civil servant.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Prior to your appointment as head of strategic communications, you were news organiser in the BBC Wales political unit based in the Senedd in Cardiff Bay; is that right?

**Mr Toby Mason**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

So you were ultimately responsible for all aspects of the Welsh Government's external communications and you were head of the profession for communications during the pandemic?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In his statement to the Inquiry, Dr Andrew Goodall has summarised the structure of the communications team, and from this statement the Inquiry understands that the central communications division had four components. These components were: the press office, which provides press support for the First Minister, Counsel General and other governmental ministers; the corporate digital team, which is responsible for the operation and content production of the Welsh Government's corporate digital channels; cabinet communications, which delivers major national events; and the central design team which provides services such as graphic design and typesetting.

Is that correct?

**Mr Toby Mason**: That is correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Is it correct that as of approximately September 2022 there were about 144 posts within the Welsh Government and only two of these posts were part of the communications profession, and these posts were either within the central communications division or working to departmental heads of communication; is that right?

**Mr Toby Mason**: There are 140 posts within the communications profession.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, thank you.

You explain in your witness statement that the communication division's principal role in the overall Covid response was to provide communications and handling advice to decision-makers and to communicate those decisions as clearly as possible. Is that correct?

**Mr Toby Mason**: That is correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In Dr Goodall's statement he states:

"The Welsh Government's approach to public health communications throughout the pandemic was governed by the principles of clarity, transparency, honesty and giving people all the key information needed to keep themselves and their families safe at every stage."

Do you agree with that characterisation?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Absolutely.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I'm now going to ask you about the role of the communications profession during the pandemic.

In your witness statement, you explain that from the outset of the pandemic, ministers and senior officials within the Welsh Government recognised the importance of clear and consistent communications.

You say in your statement that communications advice and guidance was provided as frequently as possible to inform policy and decision-making by both ministers and officials.

Can I please ask, what form did this advice and guidance take?

**Mr Toby Mason**: It took a wide variety of forms. Every paper that went to cabinet had a communications section within it that would be signed off along with the rest of the cabinet paper. I would also provide more specific papers to cabinet on particular aspects of communications handling.

Our Keep Wales Safe campaign, which we'll probably come on to later, every major kind of iteration of that and every change in messaging was communicated to cabinet so that they understood the overall strategy that we had for the kind of communications approach. And then, of course, there was the more kind of informal communications, handling advice to ministers, for example briefings before press conferences.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

What sources was your advice based upon?

**Mr Toby Mason**: So, we drew information from a wide variety of sources. Behavioural insights was important and we had a representative on the RCBI, and you heard from Professor Ann John, so that was incredibly useful.

We undertook extensive tracker polling during the pandemic, which gave us insight into people's level of trust in the Welsh Government, people's understanding and compliance with the rules at any given time, but we also undertook focus groups and they were really important for us in engaging people's sentiment towards their safety, towards the government actions, and they enabled us, I think, to put together quite a broad set of advice that ministers could then consider as part of their decision-making process.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You also explain in your witness statement that your team worked closely with the Public Health Wales communications team, given their responsibility for public health information provision.

Could you please describe your relationship with the Public Health Wales communications team in a little more detail?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, of course.

So Public Health Wales, at the very outset of the pandemic, the four nations pandemic communication plan was triggered and it was very clear that Public Health Wales at that point were the lead in informing the public on --

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm just going to interject, Mr Mason. I don't mean to interrupt you, but can I just ask you to slow down a little bit. I can feel that your pace is picking up a bit. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, you were talking about the four nations communications plan.

**Mr Toby Mason**: So Public Health Wales, along with the health communications section of the Welsh Government, worked effectively as one team in the early stages of the pandemic in order to provide public health advice to people in Wales. That was done on a -- very much a four nations basis. As the pandemic progressed and as the Welsh Government began to put in place its own rules and regulations, then obviously the role of government communications and ministerial communications began to increase dramatically, but Public Health Wales were always a very important component of our overall strategy, because they had the clinical expertise and, as we know, during a pandemic it's really important to have those trusted clinical non-political voices to the public. So they were really important.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

How regularly did you provide advice to Welsh ministers, would you say?

**Mr Toby Mason**: As I said in my earlier answer, every cabinet paper would have a communications section, some obviously were more relevant than others, but, I mean, on a kind of informal basis, on a kind of daily basis, when we as the communications leads interacted with ministers, that's the advice we would provide, but there were more formal touchpoints too.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

In your witness statement you say that as well as attending cabinet you attended meetings of the ExCovid group, the Health Protection Advisory Group, and other senior meetings within the government structure.

Do you think you had sufficient involvement in key meetings and groups during the pandemic?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I can say I absolutely did. The importance of communication as one of the key components of the government's response was absolutely recognised by the First Minister, by ministers, by successive permanent secretaries and by senior officials. I think it was really important that we had a seat at the table at those meetings. You'll see from the minutes that I contributed. And one of the things I think we were able to do was bring a degree of external perspective to those discussions through feeding in the focus group results, the social listening activities that we did as well, and I felt that was quite a -- that was a very important part of --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. We will talk about some of those later on, but thank you.

At paragraph 48 of your witness statement you say that there was initially no dedicated budget for communications. Are you able to say why that was?

**Mr Toby Mason**: So the way at that point communications budgeting worked across the government is that each policy area, when they were undertaking communications, for example climate change communications, the communications budget would come out of that to pay for that activity. So as we went into the pandemic, the -- what effectively happened was that the health communications team, who looked after the -- initially the Stay Home, Save Lives aspect of the campaign that was run jointly with the UK Government, would have budget in order to promote that in Wales alongside the UK Government. But then, and we've spoken obviously about divergence, in May 2020 the budgets for the distinctively Welsh Keep Wales Safe campaign ramped up dramatically and I think reached Â£12 million in 2021, I understand, which is, you know, a very substantial amount of money for us.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

To the extent that you haven't already answered this question, can you say what impact did the initial lack of budget for communications have on the effectiveness of the communications strategy employed?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I would say that in the early stages, given the four nations approach, the buying power of the UK Government across the UK meant that we were playing to some extent a kind of supporting and, you know, helping role in terms of, for example, making sure that material in Wales was bilingual. The ramping up of budgets that I talked about happened pretty rapidly once the divergence happened.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I would now like to turn to the approach taken by your team to communication with vulnerable and at-risk groups and those who were digitally excluded.

Before we start, can you please summarise what is meant by digitally excluded.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, this is a group of the population who either don't have access to internet, social media or struggle to kind of navigate that, and there's pretty robust data on that group.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. Are you able to say what proportion of the Welsh population would be considered to be digitally excluded?

**Mr Toby Mason**: And this is from recollection, but I think we are looking at around about a third of the over 75s, but that just gives a kind of indication.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You explain in your witness statement that:

"Advice and evidence on the direct impact of NPIs on particular groups was principally a matter for colleagues in policy and science areas, and subsequent consideration by Cabinet on the balancing of relative harms."

You note, however, that:

"... the 'at risk' and vulnerable groups, who may have been digitally excluded, were an important and distinct audience for our communications, which sought to reach groups such as these via the channels most accessible to them."

Please can you explain how you sought to reach these groups, and can you please be mindful when answering this question of efforts made to include older people in this strategy.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, absolutely.

I'll give three very, very brief examples, if I may, of the breadth of the communications work that we did.

So children and young people were really important. They don't necessarily consume news in the way that maybe adults do, and for that we made quite extensive use of TikTok, which was not a channel that we'd used as a government much at all, but that's where a lot of attention was, so we would actually take on influencers to carry our public health messages to that group.

We also had, and I referred to this in my statement, community teams who were on the ground in multi-ethnic, multicultural communities, speaking directly to people, because one of the insights that we had was that sometimes government is not necessarily the right conduit for government messages.

And then the third aspect, and this is -- goes to the points that we were making, we printed leaflets, we were pretty old-fashioned. We simplified the messages as much as possible and, you know, this was something that the Minister for Social Justice in particular was very, very -- you know, held our feet to the fire. So those leaflets were distributed through all our kind of networks of contacts, to GP surgeries, to community centres, but we also undertook all Wales door drops, so we were reaching 1.4 million households.

I hope that gives you a kind of breadth of -- we -- you know, if it was -- if we were able to reach people via channel, we would use it.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Toby Mason**: I just want to say one very brief thing, the importance of the daily press conferences --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Toby Mason**: -- they were a game-changer for us, and the decision of BBC Wales to televise those really, I think, made a huge difference, because they were -- we were able to reach, then, people who may have been digitally excluded.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry to interrupt.

By door drops, do you mean sticking them through people's letterboxes?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, you effectively contract Royal Mail to deliver one to every household in Wales.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Ms Cowen**: Thank you.

I'm going to remind you again just to keep your voice slow, and I'm sorry to keep reminding you, but please bear that in mind.

You've touched on this in your answer actually to the previous question but you do note in your witness statement that there was emerging evidence of the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, and so particular effort was made to engage with these audiences.

Can you describe anything further that you may have done subsequent to what you described in your earlier answer regarding steps taken by your department to engage with these audiences?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, absolutely, we partnered with a lot of organisations who had particular insights into these communities. We took on a specialist consultancy at one point really to kind of hone how we were doing. I think the work of the Covid-19 race advisory board chaired by Professor Ogbonna was really useful and was a very useful challenge to us. And I think one of the main things we did was, you know, work with community leaders. As I said, a trusted conduit for our messages.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Overall in your view to what extent did the Welsh Government adequately engage with at-risk and minoritised groups?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I believe we did. You can always do better and there were learnings for us throughout the pandemic, but I think as you can see from the statement and the documents that I've exhibited we did, I feel, as much as we could.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: If you're moving on, when you say you could have done better with hindsight, what might you have done better?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I think that that deep kind of community engagement, we could have expanded potentially those street teams. They were in a number of areas during the pandemic. I think -- yeah, I think that was -- that would be the main thing. And just how important that was in terms of particularly around the vaccination programme.

**Ms Cowen**: Thank you.

There is no mention of any particular efforts made by your team to reach disabled communities in your statement. Are you able to express a view on why that might be, given that disabled people face significant barriers to accessing information during the pandemic and also faced significant digital exclusion?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes. That is an omission, I think. We -- as with all kind of groups, they were really important. We had the shielding cohort, the shielding group of people, they were written to directly by the Chief Medical Officer on a number of times during the pandemic, and we -- during the press conferences, the First Minister and others would address that kind of group directly. But, you know, we were focused on getting the broadest set of messages out to the broadest number of people throughout the pandemic.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So just to be completely clear, when you say that that was an omission, do you mean that that's an omission from your statement rather than the strategy?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I think it's an omission from the statement. I think we were cognisant of that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I'm now going to ask about engagement across the four nations in terms of communications. You explain in your statement that using the devolved Public Health Act 1984 as the underpinning legislation for NPIs meant that there was always the potential for policy divergence between UK nations, and you say that this made liaison between communications teams in each of the four nations particularly important.

How did you ensure that your team had an effective relationship with the UK Government and other devolved governments?

**Mr Toby Mason**: This was absolutely -- an absolutely vital part of my and my team's role in this. A lot has been spoken about the potential for confusion due to different rules in different parts of the UK. Very high, if not the top of our list, was to ensure that people in Wales understood the rules that applied to them and what the government's messages were.

As I said, at the early stages of the pandemic, in fact up until, and it's been again rehearsed in front of the Inquiry, mid-May 2020, there was -- we were in lockstep in communications terms as much as we were in policy terms. Maybe the tone of government communications was different, but it was very, very clear what the core underlying public health messages were. During that period I think liaison was constructive and worked well. The big issue came at the COBR in mid-May --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can I just pause you there.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We may come to the COBR meeting slightly later. I just want to be clear, you have emphasised the importance of effective liaison. Can I just ask, what did you do to ensure that your team had effective liaison at the relevant time?

**Mr Toby Mason**: No, absolutely. There was liaison at all levels of the communications teams throughout the pandemic. I had contact with the UK Government's director of communications. The health -- our health communications teams were very closely involved with DHSC, Public Health England and the other devolved administrations. But the really critical point was, once the divergence took place, we formalised a four nations communications group of senior leaders, myself, the head of the UK Government's Covid communications hub and the other devolveds, and that would be a really, really important learning from the pandemic to establish early. I cannot stress that enough.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

The Inquiry understands from your statement that the formal engagement that you describe was in fact a weekly meeting with the head of the Cabinet Office Covid hub and other senior staff. The Inquiry understands that minutes were not taken of these meetings; is that right?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I don't have meeting -- minutes of those meetings. It may be that -- they were convened by Cabinet Office and the Covid hub. They may have minutes of the meetings. My role was very much to kind of feed back, almost in real time, to colleagues working on Welsh Government communications and campaigns, what the latest thinking and direction of travel was in Whitehall.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

In your statement you say that you do not recall any substantial changes to Welsh Government communications strategies as a result of these meetings or any changes to the UK Government communications strategies as a result of their impact upon Wales.

Now, you've already explained that you think a key learning point would be to, in the event of a future crisis, set up this meeting again, so it's clear that --

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- you think it is of value. Can you please explain why you think this group was particularly beneficial?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yeah, if I can just clarify on the strategies, what I'm talking about there is the kind of top-level approach, communications approach.

So we had a very distinctive approach in Wales, the UK Government took a slightly different tone and approach in their communications, and while it was useful to understand what was behind those, these meetings weren't about us telling them "You should change your" --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Toby Mason**: There was none of that. Sorry, the question was in terms of?

**Counsel Inquiry**: It's what you think the benefit of --

**Mr Toby Mason**: Oh.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Sorry, what you think the benefit of this group was.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yeah -- oh, it was -- I think there were -- there were, just very quickly, a number of things. Particularly once we got into 2021 there was really good or much better advance sharing of UK Government campaign materials, that would run in Wales. So we were able to look at them and advise the UK Government that if there were things in there that ran counter to the rules that were in place in Wales, that they could try at least to not run them in Wales. That was a really important point. And there was quite an important kind of pastoral point as well. You know, we were all working under quite a degree of stress and, you know, it incredibly useful and supportive to talk to colleagues who were in similar positions in the other governments of the UK.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

In your witness statement you give the example of the Hands, Face, Space ... Air campaign of March 2021 as illustrating the complexity of trying to get message alignment based on changing rules in each of the four nations. Can you please explain why this was such an instance of complexity?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I think again, going back to that top line of -- hands, face, space, air are the key protective behaviours that people needed to adopt, based on scientific and medical advice, during the pandemic.

We had no particular issue with UK Government communications and campaigns running in Wales because so long as they were reinforcing the absolutely key behaviours that people needed to keep the prevalence of the virus down, that was a good thing.

The problem was all the content that sat underneath there. So if you had images of, say, people gathering outdoors and it was clearly more than six people gathering outdoors, the rule in Wales at that time might have been no more than six people can gather outdoors. So that was the work.

And I have to say that Cabinet Office civil service colleagues were really diligent in terms of trying to do that, but we were dealing with hundreds, if not thousands, of pieces of content at any given time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

If I can please now turn to document INQ000282302.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I see you perhaps recognise this document?

**Mr Toby Mason**: This is exactly what we were just talking about.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right, well, you may need to help me explain this.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In your statement you say that this document was a spreadsheet that was circulated by the UK Government relating to communications activities they planned to carry out.

Can you recall when this spreadsheet was circulated?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes. This would have been -- so that phase 1, 29 March in column 3, column A, would have been, I think, 2021, and this indicate -- this is a really good example of the fact that, after a year, we did get to a point where Cabinet Office and the UK Government were very cognisant of the issues that were being caused by pieces of content --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Toby Mason**: -- giving the wrong impression to people in different nations. But this is a tiny part of an even bigger and more complicated spreadsheet that we've -- I wanted to exhibit this just to illustrate the care that was taken perhaps in the latter stages of the --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Toby Mason**: -- pandemic.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You explain in your witness statement that this spreadsheet was circulated and you or your office were asked to input changes that would need to be made to reflect the variations in rules across the four nations.

If we can, please, look to lines 1 and 2 first really, moving across line 1, at column B and C, which have a yellow background, we can see that the cells are labelled "Wales", with column B being a yes/no option and column C being headed "Dates". We can see, moving across line 1, that these column headings are replicated for Scotland and Northern Ireland, and then there are further columns relating to UK-wide matters.

Can we please look at line 26 of the spreadsheet, please. So at column A, we can see the phrase "MEETING UP AGAIN?" Is this row, therefore, about messaging relating to meeting up again?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes. This would have been, I think, the -- a piece of content that was encouraging people, as we came out of the more onerous restrictions, to meet up safely.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

There's then more detail provided in column I of line 26, so if we can just scan along to that, please.

Now, still on the topic of meeting up again, column I states that in Scotland, things depend on a child's age. In Wales, it's noted:

"Yes, but it should be clear that there are two households -- also change line 'stick to groups of six from a maximum of two households'."

So can you just explain what meaning should be taken from this entry in the spreadsheet, please.

**Mr Toby Mason**: The meaning that should be taken from this entry is that that piece of content would have been, would have had the representation of a group of people, probably given it's around meeting up. What we were effectively saying to the UK Government was: if this piece of content is to run in Wales, this is our -- these are the rules that it need to clearly depict to avoid confusing --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: But if you -- sorry to interrupt. But if you take a UK campaign, make it specific to Wales, which I understand the importance to the people of Wales, but then does it have relevance to England?

**Mr Toby Mason**: So without going too deeply into kind of media buying -- so, for example, with digital campaigns, you can -- you can have a number of different "meeting up again" pieces of content and they can be sold into -- that one piece could be sold into Welsh-facing --

**Lady Hallett**: So you can tweak it to fit your different audiences?

**Mr Toby Mason**: You could. And then that one is -- would be sold into media that people in Wales might see. You know, WalesOnline, ITV Wales, and it could be differentiated.

One of the big problems we have, if I can just make this point, the problem was that the UK Government, obviously the scale of what they were doing in terms of their media buying, their budgets, was huge. If you buy a cover wrap for The Times newspaper, so the all-encompassing, there's no Welsh edition of The Times. That is sold in Cardiff in the same way that it's sold in London. That's --

**Lady Hallett**: So you get the same cover wrap?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Which would refer to English --

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, I follow.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Ms Cowen**: Thank you.

Thank you for your explanation of this line on the spreadsheet. We've now looked at one line out of the 29 lines that are on the spreadsheet. Now, I appreciate some of the heading ones are column headings, but there are 29 lines, each line reflects a topic about which public communication was anticipated. Would it be fair to say that at this point the policies across the four nations were so different that clear communications to the public were becoming increasingly difficult?

**Mr Toby Mason**: There certainly were differences, as you can say. Some of them were sequencing differences, some were more substantive.

I think -- and the focus group data and the polling data I think do bear this out -- that from a reasonably early period after May 2020 people in Wales became quite attuned, in fact very attuned, I think, to the fact that the rules that they were being asked to follow may differ, and I think that was the overwhelming kind of imperative that we had in our communications, was just to illustrate those as clearly as possible.

I do come back to the press conferences, they were absolutely vital. The First Minister always made it clear that if people tuned in at 12.30 every day they would hear from the Welsh Government on the key messages, the progress of the virus, and any changes to Wales would be announced by the First Minister, not by ministers in London.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You explain in your witness statement that there were occasions during the pandemic where communications and campaign materials from the UK Government were published in Wales against the wishes of Welsh ministers, and you cite the introduction of the Stay Alert messaging which was introduced in England in May of 2020 as an example of this.

You state that:

"At this point the UK Government's media buying strategy was UK-wide."

And you state that it's your recollection that both the First Minister and the First Minister of Scotland expressed opposition to the Stay Alert messaging at the COBR meeting which took place on the afternoon of 10 May 2020, and expressed a view that campaign material featuring this should not be run by the UK Government in either Scotland or Wales, given the key message in those nations at that point was to stay home.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You state that you were not given advance notice of the Stay Alert campaign prior to its introduction in England and that your recollection was that the first you were aware of this campaign was when you saw it in the Sunday Telegraph on the morning of Sunday 10 May, which was the day of the COBR meeting itself.

Can we please bring up document INQ000281683, please.

This is an email dated 5 May 2020, which you sent to various officials in the Welsh Government, and in this email you summarise a conversation you had with the director of UK Government communications.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: At the fifth paragraph of the email, you state:

"It is pretty clear that after Thursday/Sunday that from the [UK Government] side 'stay home, save lives' has gone, all marketing collateral will be removed -- the question is what it is replaced with. Could be something as simple as 'Stay Safe' as a strapline, with a series of sub-headings around the measures that people and businesses can take (not verbatim but an indication)."

Is it your recollection that the Stay Alert campaign was not discussed in detail in this conversation with the director of the UK Government's communications team?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes. Just to be clear that this was the Tuesday of the week that ended with the COBR on the Sunday, just to give a sense of where we are with this.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Toby Mason**: It's my sense that actually the UK Government had not by this stage settled on what -- their kind of campaign approach, so I wouldn't say there was an attempt not to tell me.

What you see in this email is, I think, pennies dropping in Wales and in the UK Government that the theoretical potential for divergence is about to become real, and you touched on this with Jane Runeckles earlier on.

So my response to that was obviously to make sure that there was a clear record of this conversation, but then what we did was accelerate the development of our own Keep Wales Safe brand. Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS was going to be withdrawn. So this was the kind of impetus for that.

On the point about Stay Alert, yes, I recall conversations very early on that Sunday morning, as we saw the Sunday Telegraph, and it was a kind of "Oh, that's what they're going with". It was then included in the papers for the COBR meeting that we received a couple of hours before on Sunday.

Neither the First Minister of Wales nor the First Minister of Scotland were content with that. That led to comms colleagues in the UK Government having to unpick very rapidly -- sorry to use media buying again, but their media buying strategy.

But that was also the reason, I think, that the four nations directors of comms group was set up, was in order to try to avoid that crunch that happened on Sunday's COBR.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Now, there might be an issue as to whether formal notice of the proposed policy change was given, but even if notice was not given, do you think the Welsh Government could have been more proactive in liaising with the UK Government to agree a communications strategy around this policy change?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Well, as you can see, we were discussing it at very kind of senior levels. It may not be in this email, but I think it might be on the next page of the email that there was an action from the GPS -- yes, if I can read --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Toby Mason**: -- "For awareness, this is an action from yesterday's GPS MIG, which may have prompted the call. Home Office and their counterparts in devolved administrations to ensure there is clear public communication of potential differences following Thursday's review."

And that was the process. But I think, you know, policy was being decided very close to the wire. Equally, kind of, communications followed that as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You may have answered this already, but just to cover the point, would you agree that the Welsh Government bears some responsibility for confusion around public messaging at this point?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I don't believe so. We were very clear: we spoke to the people of Wales. And we spoke to them through our channels, through the press conferences, through all the interviews that, you know, the First Minister and other ministers did. We made sure that we didn't confine that to Welsh media. So the First Minister would do hundreds of interviews and -- you know, Good Morning Britain, you know, BBC Breakfast, BBC network, and what we were trying to do, from this -- well, before this but particularly from this stage onwards, was really to educate the London media about the reality of what a devolved pandemic was going to look like, and we invested really quite a bit of resource into doing that. And to be fair, as time went on, I think the London -- the UK-based media that we see in Wales did become much better at reflecting the differences across the four nations.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

We're actually going to come to that point now. I'm going to ask you about some questions about differentiation in communications campaigns.

You note in your witness statement the issue of English-specific campaigns being launched in UK-wide publications. You explain that:

"In light of this, the Cabinet Office made efforts at very short notice to restrict the media buying to England only, but this gave an early indication of the complexity of delivering different messages to different parts of the UK."

Is it fair then to say that the Cabinet Office did attempt to help the Welsh Government and the other devolved nations when it became aware of issues such as these?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, they did. And I have to say, my relations -- as I say in my statement, but for the record, my relations with civil servants in Cabinet Office and other devolved administrations, even when there were policy differences between administrations, were always polite, respectful and we worked very well together.

Cabinet Office I think did what they could. I think one area of frustration, I think it's picked up by Professor Henderson in her report to Module 2, was quite frequently the UK Government, the Downing Street briefings, even when they were on devolved matters, barely referenced England, and of course those were broadcast across the BBC and other outlets that cover the whole of Wales, and we did make strenuous efforts at every level, including First Ministerial, to try to appeal to them to be more clear.

We didn't have that problem in the sense that it was very clear that, you know, we were speaking to people in -- people in Wales.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Could we now, please, look at document INQ000282289, please. Thank you.

This is a report summarising the findings of a focus group and the report is dated 21 May 2020. If we turn to page 3 of this document, please, and the first and second bullet points there, they state that:

"Participants voiced regret and concern that the UK is no longer taking a joined-up approach to managing the pandemic across all four nations.

"All participants voiced a strong preference for a joined-up, UK-wide ... [Document read] ... leading to an increase in the spread of the virus."

What was your view of this feedback at the time, that being May 2020?

**Mr Toby Mason**: So this was a really important kind of way of taking the temperature. I think the point I would make is that the Welsh Government's preference was for a joined-up UK-wide response, where there would be greater, you know, co-ordination of approaches between the four nations. I think, as Jane Runeckles said earlier on, once the 1984 Public Health Act is brought in, then divergence becomes a theoretical and then a practical possibility.

I do -- I do think -- I think later in this focus group I think the participants were also very clear that they favoured the Welsh more cautious approach to what was happening in England, and I think that's quite important to note.

I don't think -- if you look at the report as a whole, that is not a criticism of the Welsh Government, but they are voicing a preference that the situation we are now in is potentially complex and confusing.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Did you take any steps to address the point raised by this feedback at the time?

**Mr Toby Mason**: We just redoubled our efforts to make sure that people in Wales had clarity about the rules as they applied to them.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Of course it isn't just differences between what the Welsh Government were doing and the UK Government were doing, Scotland did things differently.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes. Yes, no, that's entirely true. I mean, the big issue that we had was the porosity of the media border, particularly between England and Wales, but yes, from a citizens' point of view there would also be -- you know, the First Minister of Scotland would be on the 6 o'clock news announcing a slightly different, be it sequencing or set of rules. Yes.

**Ms Cowen**: Thank you.

I'd now like to turn to ask you about Wales-specific communication during the pandemic.

You explain in your witness statement that you took a decision that communications within specific pandemic related programmes would be undertaken using the overarching Keep Wales Safe brand in order to build on the trust and recognition that that campaign had accrued. That campaign was developed by the Welsh Government in May of 2020, as what you term a distinctively Welsh brand to communicate the regulations in Wales.

Can you please explain how you arrived at the decision to launch the Keep Wales Safe brand?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes. So this goes back to the email that we saw earlier on, which was, at the point of divergence, we couldn't simply -- at that point it was not tenable or correct to follow UK Government messaging, and if there was to be broader divergence, then it needed to be very clear to people in Wales who -- that we were speaking to them.

Keep Wales Safe was a phrase that I think the First Minister had been using in some of his even quite early press conferences, and what we found interesting was, in our focus groups, when we asked people "What do you want? What do you want from your government?" overwhelmingly they said "We want to be kept safe and we want our families to be safe".

So we then worked that up very rapidly in May into a campaign, we tested that back with the focus groups, and there was -- they said "Yes, this speaks to us in terms of a Welsh identity but also, you know, the imperative that we want". And I think that enabled us to have an umbrella brand across all our, kind of, communications activities across all sectors.

The really important thing with Keep Wales Safe is that we flexed it at different times. So we were looking at the data modelling from TAC and TAG, and if it became clear that there was a large potential second or even third wave coming, we would be flexing our campaign planning to have a much harder edged approach. So maybe in the summer months it would be "Let's keep Wales safe together", with that very cautious but more permissive view on meeting up.

In the winter, when prevalence was higher, we moved to a much harder edged "Disrupt the transmission to keep Wales safe". So we, yeah, we found it to be a really, kind of, useful -- you know, a really powerful approach.

And I just would also say how bought in our public sector partners were to it, because we did it in a way that enabled them to adapt that content very easily for their kind of local areas with an overarching national brand.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I would just like to pick up on one thing that you talked about earlier in your statement, that was the use of social listening reports.

Can we please bring up document INQ000282290, please.

Now, this is an example of a social listening report. It's from 2 November 2020. If we go to page 1 of the document, under the heading "Topic mentions in Wales", we can see there the nature of the summaries produced by the social listening research. If we can go to the bottom of page 1, under the heading "Firebreak", we can then see snapshots of the top issues that have been picked up on.

Is it fair to say that the social listening exercise produces a very high-level summary and then pulls out specific quotations?

You mentioned earlier that you thought these reports were particularly useful -- can you explain, is that right? Did you mean to say that or have I misconstrued you?

**Mr Toby Mason**: No, they were useful. I think with social monitoring they are a useful general indicator of sentiment, but I think we would never advise ministers and our senior officials, you know, to treat them as being necessarily representative of public sentiment as a whole. It is a useful additional and quite immediate tool, alongside polling and focus groups, but also the feedback that we were getting from our partners as to sentiment on the ground in relation to --

**Counsel Inquiry**: I see.

**Mr Toby Mason**: -- for example, compliance with regulations.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I'd now like to ask some specific questions about the public messaging campaigns implemented during the pandemic.

If I may, please, begin by asking: why was the focus of public messaging on protecting the NHS and not on other sectors, for example care homes ?

**Mr Toby Mason**: So that campaign was very much a UK Government campaign, that's ... it was launched I think in -- you know, in March. I -- my understanding is that the -- from what I've read, the polling that they were doing, because they did even more kind of polling and focus grouping than we did, indicated that the -- a primary driver of people's behaviours were to protect the NHS and, in order to gain the kind of compliance with the regulations and the stay-home rules, that that would be the primary driver. But we weren't closely involved in the development of that campaign, we assisted with the way that it ran in Wales.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Second, were communications always delivered in the Welsh language? Do you consider there was parity with English language communications?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes. We took bilingualism -- well, we have a statutory responsibility as a government to communicate in both languages and not treat one less favourably than the other. Yeah, it was -- and one of the things that we did was, and we've kind of built on this since the pandemic, is rather than just slavishly translate English into Welsh, you can actually have more, kind of, Welsh idioms that would appeal to, kind of, Welsh speakers as well. So, yes, it was a really important part of our work.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. Reports provided to the Inquiry have also commented on how the government's use of the term "following the science" was very damaging. To what extent was this a message that featured in the Welsh Government's communications strategy?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I wouldn't necessarily say it was part of the strategy. It was used by ministers at, kind of, press conferences and in interviews. From my point of view, having seen how carefully ministers weighed the, kind of, scientific and medical advice that was in front of them, they -- that was their decision to use that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do you have a view on the impact of -- that kind of messaging had on the accountability of political decision-makers and the public perception of who made decisions?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I think it was very, very clear who was accountable for the decisions made in Wales through our communications.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I'd now like to ask some questions about the effectiveness of Wales' communications strategy.

You explain in your witness statement that your focus group work and your polling enabled you to assess the extent to which the messages and communications were resonating with the public, and the extent to which people were accessing those messages and the likely reaction to potential future restrictions in different circumstances.

Can we please bring up document INQ000066103, please.

This is a further focus group report, and this group -- this report, sorry, is dated 13 May of 2020.

Could we please turn to page 2. Thank you, I see that we have that.

That is a summary of the key findings. I would just like to look at two in particular.

The first is at paragraph 4, and that states that:

"Despite some initial confusion, participants felt the distinction between UK and Welsh Governmental announcements is relatively clear."

To what extent do you consider that that was due to your communications strategy?

**Mr Toby Mason**: As I've said to the Inquiry, that was our objective and it was -- it was good to see that being reflected in the -- back to us in the focus groups.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Could we now, please, bring up document INQ000327735, please.

This is Dr Goodall's statement.

Can we, please, turn to paragraph 463, which is at page 115 of the statement. Thank you.

In this part of Dr Goodall's statement, he summarises the reach of the Keep Wales Safe campaign. He states that it was significant:

"... for example, between April and September 2021, it reached the following percentages of the Welsh population ..."

And there is therein set out a breakdown of different groups and how the messaging was being received.

Of note, in relation to the C2, D and E groups, the reach is 93.45%, that's in fact the lowest percentage in the summary. Why do you think the campaign had the lowest reach amongst individuals in those groups?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I couldn't say for sure. What I would say is that these reach numbers are very, very high across the board for any other campaign that a government would run. I'm not sure, it could be a mix of the media buy, but -- no, these are very, very high numbers generally.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

If we then, please, look at paragraph 464 of the statement, that's at page 116, thank you.

This states that in the tracker poll carried out in mid-August of 2021, awareness of Keep Wales Safe peaked at 81% of all adults in Wales.

Do you have a view on why this figure is lower than the figures in the previous paragraph?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes. So reach -- reach is a theoretical percentage that is generated by -- if a campaign runs across these channels at this frequency, that is what the reach of the campaign is. Awareness, which is really important, is more along the lines of: if you ask people to spontaneously say what is the Welsh Government's key message or what is their campaign, if they reply to you "It's Keep Wales Safe", that is the awareness level, and 81% is very good for that, for any campaign.

**Lady Hallett**: So, putting it -- again, sorry, to go back to Scotland, but just so I'm following. So I heard a bit in Scotland about the FACTS campaign and so, had I looked at the reach figures, they might have been quite high because that was the theoretical number that the campaign --

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: But then when people were asked if they understood what FACTS stood for --

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: -- they didn't.

**Mr Toby Mason**: They didn't. So that would be --

**Lady Hallett**: So that's the awareness figure?

**Mr Toby Mason**: That would be more on the awareness figure, yes. I mean, our decision was we used Keep Wales Safe as an umbrella brand, as I said, and the protective behaviours would sit underneath there rather than have an acronym.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry to interrupt.

**Ms Cowen**: Thank you.

If I could now ask for document INQ000388424 is brought up, please.

I'm sorry, I think that's probably a mistake.

**Lady Hallett**: It's all been redacted.

**Ms Cowen**: Sections of it have.

If I can ask you, please, to look at a message on page 2, please, and this is a message of 14 March 2020 that is timed at 14.48.39.

This is a message between you and Shan Morgan on WhatsApp, and in this message there is reference to concerns being raised about co-ordination and inconsistency of approach between different parts of the government.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I don't propose to read the message out, but you can see certainly the text of the message and the concerns that are raised regarding co-ordination.

Do you agree that co-ordination and consistency between the different parts of the Welsh Government at a time of increasing concern around the virus was vitally important?

**Mr Toby Mason**: My recollection of this period was, it wasn't so much co-ordination of the government's approach to tackling the virus, my recollection is that different -- we were at a stage when the questions around whether people should work from home or not were becoming very, very live. I think it was more there were some departments that were telling their staff "You should work from home", others saying "No, come into the office", I think, and I think the concern -- because we had to be, you know, an exemplar, as a Welsh Government, in terms of that, and I think -- I think it was more around, kind of, the internal processes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So would you agree that an inconsistent approach from within the Welsh Government would have also been confusing for the public and would impact on public perception as regards the severity of the virus and trust in the government?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, I think that was the concern.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can I please then just ask you to look at the message at 14.57.07. Shan Morgan therefore says:

"OK -- Thanks. Sometimes inconsistency is actually flexibility."

Why would you agree with that statement given what you've just said?

**Mr Toby Mason**: It ... this was a -- so there were people ... I think a blanket work from home -- there were -- there were some of us who attended the office throughout most of the pandemic on the basis that there needed to be really close -- and things were moving so quickly that there needed to be really close, kind of, co-ordination, so I guess there was an element of there needed to be some flexibility that people -- people could. But, you know, I think the point about consistency is really important.

**Ms Cowen**: Thank you very much.

Thank you, my Lady, that concludes my questions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

I think there's a question or questions.

Questions From Ms Heaven

**Ms Heaven**: Good afternoon, I think, Mr Mason. My name is Kirsten Heaven and I represent the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru. So can I start with the topic of :outline:`face coverings`, please.

The day is 9 June and it's the day of Vaughan Gething's press statements on :outline:`face coverings`. No doubt you will remember that, but just to give us all a quick reminder: five days before, the UK Government had announced :outline:`face coverings` were mandatory on public transport in England, and in this statement obviously we know Vaughan Gething is simply saying that :outline:`face coverings` will be recommended where social distancing is not possible.

You're nodding your head, no doubt you remember that well.

**Mr Toby Mason**: I do.

**Ms Heaven**: Thank you. So we have some very clear divergence there.

Before I ask you about your email communications on that day trying to sort out the press statement, can I just ask you to confirm -- we've seen some WhatsApps, I put them to Shan Morgan, we understand they're with you but your number, I think, was redacted.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, that's correct.

**Ms Heaven**: Yes. So can I just ask you, just if we could bring them up on screen, just so we can confirm you are the person speaking to Shan Morgan.

It's INQ000388424-004.

My Lady this is the communication around banging of heads on the morning of the 9th and ":outline:`face mask militancy`".

*(Pause)*

**Ms Heaven**: So if we can just zoom in, please, it's quite hard to see, it's at the very bottom. There we go:

"Hope all goes well at the press conference -- it all sounded a bit muddled ..."

Then we think it's you said:

"A number of heads banged ahead together ... thrown as narrow a ring around it has I possibly can to avoid all the knock ons. Still pretty worried. Transport colleagues in the loop from the TFW side."

Is that you?

**Mr Toby Mason**: That is, yes.

**Ms Heaven**: Thank you very much. Well, I'm not going to ask you about that.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Ah, okay.

**Ms Heaven**: It's just to correct the record so that we know that it's the director of communications that's speaking to Shan Morgan.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yeah.

**Ms Heaven**: So, again, before I get the email up that I'm allowed to ask you about, a little bit more context.

5 June, the World Health Organisation publishes advice on :outline:`face coverings`, and we know that it recommended that government should be saying that :outline:`you should wear a face covering`, but it also recommended :outline:`medical masks` for vulnerable populations. So that was people over 60 with underlying health conditions.

So let's look at the series of emails between yourself, Fliss Bennee and others trying to sort out the press statement on the day Vaughan Gething gives his announcement.

So it's INQ000215458, and it's 0007, please. Sorry, let's start at 0006.

Now, this is the email from yourself there. I'm just going to read it to you. Has it come up on the screen? This is the --

**Mr Toby Mason**: -- yes.

**Ms Heaven**: So you say:

"I'm really concerned about the handling of the 1230 press conference following the 9am call. I don't believe ... [Document read] ... sectoral guidance, developed with stakeholders ..."

Okay. Now, you appear to be concerned here that if the Welsh Government were to go out in public on 9 June, so in other words Vaughan Gething, and on the website, and tell the vulnerable people in Wales that the WHO are now recommending that they should have :outline:`medical grade masks`, that this would cause really major implications for policy; is that right? That was your concern at this point in time?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, that's what the email says, yes.

**Ms Heaven**: What we know eventually happened is that a press statement went out. I think probably Vaughan Gething has given his statement to the public. He makes no mention that the WHO are telling vulnerable people to have :outline:`medical masks`. We'll come on to that in a moment.

But the press statement that goes on to the government website is just a few pages up. So if you scroll up, please, there is a few iterations but the final version that goes out is at 002, and it goes on to 003.

So if we can just look at 002 there:

":outline:`Three-layer face coverings` ..."

And 003, it goes down.

Now, we don't need to read it but you can take it from me that there is no reference in this press statement to the fact that the WHO were recommending that vulnerable people should have access to :outline:`medical masks`.

Can you assist us with why that was the case and was that on your advice, that that information should not go to the Welsh public?

**Mr Toby Mason**: So, I'm kind of reading this as we go along.

**Ms Heaven**: I appreciate that, yes.

**Mr Toby Mason**: If we were -- this statement says we're following WHO advice, I would assume that that recommendation is that people in Wales should wear :outline:`three-layer face coverings`. In the previous email that we looked at there was reference to a TAG paper, the Technical Advisory Group paper.

**Ms Heaven**: Yes, I'll come on to that in a moment, because that piece of information is also missing from the TAG paper and I was going to ask you about that separately.

**Mr Toby Mason**: Okay.

**Ms Heaven**: If we just focus on the initial question --

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes.

**Ms Heaven**: -- which is that the WHO, we know, was saying vulnerable people had to have access to :outline:`medical grade masks`. It's missing from Vaughan Gething's press statement, it's missing from the press statement on the Welsh Government website. So I'm just seeking your assistance as to whether or not that was on your advice, because obviously I've just read to you an email which says that the issue of :outline:`medical grade masks` "will be pushed beyond today".

So I'm just seeking to understand, is that something that you advised needed to stay out of the press statements, needed to not be given to the Welsh public and pushed to a later date?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I -- we have this email -- I don't know what the sequence of events were on this morning. What I do know is that while there were, kind of -- I could give communications advice about the way particular things would land, ultimately this would have been signed off by Fliss Bennee and others as being the correct government position.

**Ms Heaven**: Would you accept from me, looking at your email, it's very clear, isn't it, that you knew that the WHO were talking about vulnerable people needing access to :outline:`medical grade masks`? You obviously knew that on that day, didn't you? It's in your email.

**Mr Toby Mason**: I presume I did from the email. I don't -- again, I haven't gone back and looked at the WHO advice itself at this stage.

**Ms Heaven**: Would you have drafted Vaughan Gething's statement to the press that day?

**Mr Toby Mason**: No.

**Ms Heaven**: Who would have drafted that then?

**Mr Toby Mason**: It would have been drafted by the relevant press officer, I think.

**Ms Heaven**: And I did say I was going to assist you on the TAG paper. So the TAG paper that was eventually published on 9 June made no reference to the WHO recommendation that vulnerable people should have access to :outline:`medical masks`. Now, that was the final version that was published. But what I want to understand from you is: do you recollect, was there an earlier version of the TAG paper which did talk about vulnerable people having access to :outline:`medical masks`?

The reason I ask you that is because if we look at your email again, and that's at 0007, it does reference the TAG paper "bringing a huge number of queries and demands like the provision of :outline:`medical grade masks` to vulnerable people".

So that would seem to suggest that at one point there was a TAG paper talking about vulnerable people having :outline:`medical masks`, and that that might have then been removed from the one that was eventually published. Can you assist on that?

**Mr Toby Mason**: So I was not closely involved with development of TAG papers, I didn't sit on TAG, I don't -- I don't recall. This is kind of a note after a discussion. But, again, whatever TAG published in the end was their responsibility.

**Ms Heaven**: Okay. And you could only work on that, presumably, because you're not the scientist, essentially?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I'm definitely not a scientist.

**Ms Heaven**: No.

My Lady, I've got one more question. Have I got time?

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, certainly.

**Ms Heaven**: Let's just get through these very quickly then, so -- they're just straight questions, you'll be pleased to hear.

Why were media communications :outline:`initially so focused on hand washing`, with :outline:`no focus on Covid-19 being airborne` and asymptomatic? So we're looking here at March to June 2020.

**Mr Toby Mason**: That was the scientific advice from SAGE and the chief medical officers at the time.

**Ms Heaven**: Okay.

Again, was there any discussion on public messaging around :outline:`mitigation for airborne` or asymptomatic transmission? So do you remember when that discussion came in?

**Mr Toby Mason**: :outline:`Ventilation` -- I don't remember exactly when :outline:`ventilation` became a greater issue, I remember it becoming more and more important. And that's why I think we referred to it earlier on, HF -- :outline:`Hands, Face, Space` ... Air came in. I would say on that that we incorporated that into our messaging, but it was a good example, that the UK Government worked up a campaign called let's :outline:`Stop Covid Hanging Around`, it was quite a dramatic campaign, and that was an example of a campaign that we were very happy to run in Wales by the UK Government because it addressed one of the key emerging preventative behaviours.

**Ms Heaven**: Finally, in late 2021 the Welsh Government ran its :outline:`Stop Covid Hanging Around:outline:` campaign and that was by that stage to stress that :outline:`Covid was airborne`, so did you ensure that the Welsh Government's communication on this was aligned with Public Health Wales and NHS Wales communications to challenge any misleading or confusing guidance from Public Health Wales that might not have aligned with what the Welsh Government were saying?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I wasn't aware of any advice that didn't align with that. As I say, this was a good example of, as the science developed and the understanding of the virus developed, the communications adapted with it.

**Ms Heaven**: Okay, thank you very much.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Heaven.

Ms Foubister.

Questions From Ms Foubister

**Ms Foubister**: Thank you, my Lady.

Good morning, Mr Mason, I represent John's Campaign and Care Rights UK.

In your witness statement and today you've spoken about communication with the vulnerable groups, and you referred to particular efforts with black, Asian and minority ethnic communities given the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on them.

Were you aware that Covid-19 and its response had a disproportionate impact on the care sector, for example that in the first three months of the pandemic nearly 40% of Covid deaths were of people in care homes?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, I mean, the issue of care homes was very live within the government, yes.

**Ms Foubister**: What particular efforts were made to communicate with those involved in the care sector, be it carers, people being cared for at home or living in care homes? Were particular efforts made, and if so what were then?

**Mr Toby Mason**: So if I divide that into two quick parts. Obviously all our campaign work around preventative behaviours was aimed at the entire population, which would include those working in care homes. Where there were more specific, kind of, technical, sector-specific advice to those working in care homes and those operating care homes, they would have come on a, kind of, stakeholder basis from the director of social services within the Welsh Government out into those -- out into that sector.

**Ms Foubister**: So you refer to specific stakeholder perspective from the director of social services. What communications would have come from them in relation to things that might affect the care sector?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I don't know specifically, my role was around the kind of -- the entirety of external communications, but I would imagine that there was -- that information -- as knowledge of the virus and its impact developed, that there would be communication at that level between the Welsh Government, Care Forum Wales and the sector more generally.

**Ms Foubister**: So it wasn't part of your role specifically to deal with communications for the care sector specifically?

**Mr Toby Mason**: No.

**Ms Foubister**: Are you aware that concerns have been raised that communications relevant to the care sector were inconsistent, confusing and unclear?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I wasn't aware of that specifically.

**Ms Foubister**: Then you might not be able to help with my next question, but do you have any ideas about what could be done to improve clarity of communications with the care sector?

**Mr Toby Mason**: I don't -- I don't, in terms of that sort of specific sector. What I do know is that we tried at all times to be very, very clear in all our communications to the whole country about what the level of risk was and the steps people could take to protect themselves.

**Ms Foubister**: Did you have any expert advice on the communication needs of people in the care sector?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Not to my knowledge.

**Ms Foubister**: Finally, was there a single person who was responsible for ensuring that guidance and communications relating to restrictions were clear and consistent?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Do you mean for the care sector or more generally?

**Ms Foubister**: In general or the care sector specifically.

**Mr Toby Mason**: In general terms, we as a government had a collective responsibility for making sure that the communications around regulations and behaviours were clear. On the care sector more specifically, that would sit, I think, with probably the relevant Welsh Government department or the local authority director of social services.

**Ms Foubister**: Do you think it might be helpful going forward for there to be someone specific targeted with ensuring clear consistency in communications for future situations like this?

**Mr Toby Mason**: Yes, I mean, I -- that was ultimately my responsibility and the responsibility of the wider government.

**Ms Foubister**: Thank you.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

Thank you very much, Mr Mason. I think we've put you through the difficult task of marking your own homework for long enough, so thank you for your help.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: I shall return at 1.45.

*(12.50 pm)*

*(The short adjournment)*

*(1.45 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: I hope we haven't kept you waiting.

**The Witness**: Not at all.

**Mr Poole**: Can I call Simon Hart, please.
