======================

*MR JUSTIN TOMLINSON (sworn).*

Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Lady Hallett**: I undertake we will complete your evidence today, having kept you waiting.

**Mr Keating**: That's a promise, a guarantee we will finish today.

Thank you so much for making yourself available today, thank you for your patience this morning and waiting, and thank you for your statement and assisting the Inquiry with its investigations.

Just a few things before we start. If we both can keep our voices up. Secondly, avoid overspeaking because there is a note being kept of your evidence. And pace, pace of answers, if we could try to monitor that pace and not speak too fast, I think it will assist the record, which is being kept.

The statement you see before us, and thank you for providing that. It's dated 7 August 2023, with 67 exhibits, and you have had an opportunity to see that and you've signed that statement with a declaration that it's true to the best of your knowledge belief; is that correct?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yes, that's right.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In relation to why you are here to assist the Inquiry, it's regarding your role as Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, and you held that role between January 2020 and 16 September 2021, so the three lockdowns was during the period when you held that position.

To assist you, I want to outline how we're going to deal with your oral evidence today, building upon your written evidence. Two parts. The first part is structural, dealing with your role as a minister of state, the Disability Unit, which we'll discuss in a moment, and how that fits into governmental decision-making. It shouldn't take us too much time. That's the first part.

The second part I want to explore some key events with you, and we'll deal with them in chronological order, and there is three broad themes I want you to consider, and then we will cover them as we go through that time period.

Firstly, visibility, was there sufficient visibility insight and data regarding the needs of disabled people during the pandemic.

Secondly, engagement. Was the engagement that was undertaken -- and there was engagement which was undertaken -- was that sufficient and did that fit into decision-making?

Lastly, delay. Were the needs of disabled people sufficiently and promptly considered during the pandemic?

So there are three areas I would like us to cover in part 2. I know your statement covers the other areas.

And the last promise today, you have had one already, is that at the end I'll give you the opportunity to add anything you think which is significant to assist the Inquiry with its investigations, and we'll deal with lessons learnt. Okay?

Briefly, your professional background we see at paragraph 5 of your statement. You became an MP in 2010, Member of Parliament. In 2015 you were appointed by the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, to serve as the Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for Disabled People. It's at paragraph 6.

Then at paragraph 7 we know that you rejoined Government as a minister within the Department for Work and Pensions, first as an undersecretary and then later as a minister of state, a Minister for Disabled People, Health -- in April 2019, and that's the role we're going to ask you about.

Before the pandemic took place. So against that background, part 1, structure.

So the role of minister, firstly the Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, it's within the Department for Work and Pensions. I think you were described -- you may not have heard -- as having junior position, a short time ago, but it was the second most senior ministerial position within the DWP; is that correct?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: That's right. So the first time I served as the Minister for Disabled People, I was a parliamentary undersecretary. When I returned the second time the role had been upgraded to minister of state, so I was, in effect, number two in the Department of Work and Pensions.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And the Secretary of State, the most senior minister within that department, and at Cabinet level, was Thérèse Coffey at that stage?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of the size of the group, disabled people, that interests you were seeking to represent is huge?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm just going to draw upon a document which is within your exhibits but 21% of people in Britain are disabled? That's 14.1 million people. Of that, 8% are children, and 19% of the working age population and 44% of the pension age adults --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- category.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Just to be clear, that's disabled or those with long-term health conditions, and it's predominantly our bodies and minds can't quite keep up with us with age, because what surprises a lot of people is the prevalence later in age rather than necessarily born with either of those.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes?

**Lady Hallett**: You said 21% in Britain, I don't know how precise we have to be, by that do you mean England, Wales, Scotland or just England?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yes, yes.

**Mr Keating**: It's my terminology, I think we should say the United Kingdom. I was quoting --

**Lady Hallett**: So it is the United Kingdom, it includes Northern Ireland?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: There is variations, so there's a greater prevalence in Wales and possibly Scotland, I can't really remember, but certainly 21 -- one in five was the stat that we would generally use.

**Mr Keating**: We may see, and we may touch upon that document in a moment, but on any basis, as you say, one in five, a substantial proportion of the population.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of your role as that minister, if we have a -- if you could bring up paragraph 2(a), so go back to page 1, please, thank you very much. Thank you.

Your responsibilities as minister of state, it says:

"some specific disability policy and cross-government responsibility for disabled people."

Can I focus on that just for a moment. When you say "some specific disability" responsibility, what do you mean -- why the qualification?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So for example I was solely responsible for disability benefits. At that time that would amount to about £13.6 billion worth of government expenditure. That was predominantly through my DWP role.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: But in other areas I would make representations on behalf of disabled people to other responsible departments. So, for example, if I'd had a stakeholder meeting and they raised accessible train stations, then I would relay that to the Department for Transport, who are ultimately responsible for how accessible stations are or aren't.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So to use your terminology in the statement, you, in effect, were the champion of disability rights within government?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah, yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The second part of your role I want to touch upon is oversight of the DU, that's the Disability Unit. We'll touch upon that in a moment and perhaps we can -- I can deal with that now. It's at paragraph 9 of your statement and you describe the Disability Unit. And this is actually quite a relevant part structurally of how the interests of disabled people are represented within government. This was formed in November 2019 and:

"It brought together the Office for Disability Issues ..."

In relation to the Office for Disability Issues, that was within DWP?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And that's when you were in your ministerial post, and then that became the Disability Unit and migrated over into the Cabinet Office?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And at the beginning of the pandemic it was the Disability Unit and then by September 2020, if I understand your written evidence --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- it became part of the Equality Hub?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Is that a fair summary?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yes, yes, it is.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And the Equality Hub, as an umbrella, covered Disability Unit --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- the Race Disparity Unit, and also the Government Equalities Office?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And there is, of course, a Minister for Equalities. And your role was to assist with that migration?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Perhaps you may have not heard but Lord Sedwill perhaps touch upon the rationale why the Disability Unit was brought into existence and brought into the Cabinet Office, and see if you agree with this, the rationale was to bring some stability to coverage of those interests, to counterbalance ministerial change or churn, not his word. That's the context we've had. Perhaps you could tell me your understanding --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So my understanding and my recollection is Cabinet Office is the eyes and ears of the machinery of government, and whilst I was based in DWP, any stakeholder engagement would invariably bring up issues that were beyond DWP's scope and responsibility, and it was more efficient, from a Cabinet Office angle, to then go and chase up the relevant departments to either flag the issue, seek resolution, et cetera. And so it was a move I was very supportive of. And then it sort of -- being part of the Equality Hub also made sense because there was a lot of co-working, particularly around data and sharing that. So it made sense.

It was -- it was a different building, so as a minister it was the inconvenience of being spread across two, but I absolutely understood the decision behind that and it was one I supported.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of your role, you had oversight --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- of the Disability Unit. Did you have direct responsibility for the Disability Unit?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yes, though it did sit within -- ultimately within the Equality Hub, which was the responsibility of a different secretary of state to my own, so I wouldn't have done the operational day-to-day things, but I would have -- certainly in any stakeholder engagement the Disability Unit would have been present and they would have taken the responsibility of chasing that up with the relevant departments, relevant ministers.

And I have to say they were an impressive unit who were very, very efficient at taking up any of the challenges and issues that were raised.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The last aspect of this part 1 of your evidence is, with two hats on, you are now outside government --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- and with lessons learned or how we can improve things going forward, with that mindset, was there, do you think, at the time, or looking back, a drawback that you were a minister, not a minister of state, in the DWP and not a minister within the Cabinet Office?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: And I think that's fair to dig into because I've looked at many of the submissions that have come in and this has been raised, and it's a difficult -- I can't give a definitive answer because there is advantages and disadvantages.

Disability benefits is £13.6 billion at the time of Covid, it's greater now, 2.1 million people, and so for many people with disabilities and long-term health conditions that would be the absolute priority for a minister, because if financial stability wasn't in place the consequences could be catastrophic.

But counter to that, Cabinet Office is better placed for cross-government work, because it is the eyes and engines. So I can't give a definitive answer because there is advantages and disadvantages to both. Both can work, but, having stepped out, I think probably a disability minister probably would be better placed in Cabinet Office, and I think the disability benefits can run -- be run still from DWP as part of the wider benefits, but there would be some downside to that because there would be less focus.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So what we would have in this alternative structure would be a minister for equalities?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Which ideally would be somebody who was a secretary of state, so at Cabinet Office level, and then underneath that the minister for disabilities, and then with liaison between the minister of disabilities and the DWP to ensure the important financial support remains?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Last point in terms of your involvement during the Covid response, as a minister of state but not a Cabinet -- a secretary of state, it's right, isn't it, that you -- on the whole, there is some exceptions which we will turn to, you did not attend COBR or Cabinet or the ministerial implementation groups or the Covid-O groups, as -- overall that was the position?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah, that's right.

**Counsel Inquiry**: There is exceptions, which we'll turn to.

In terms of the interests of disabled people, how were they represented and raised at COBR --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- at the relative MIG --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- or Covid-O?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So there are a number of strands. So, first of all, my Secretary of State, Thérèse Coffey, was exceptionally hard working, took her role very seriously, so she was keen to attend COBR as the senior member of the department. She would have daily meetings, so all ministers within DWP could flag issues. She was very receptive to issues being raised, which she would then take up if they needed to be. There were occasions where I attended where there were specific disability-related issues.

And then the way that government works is the civil servants take those issues up, try to get them resolved, and generally either if they have been resolved they were flagged back to ministers, so we knew for future stakeholder engagement, or if there were issues they would be brought back to ministers who could then either escalate them to other ministers who were responsible, and that would generally work.

And again, I have to pay tribute that the civil servants -- and I know there has been a lot of scrutiny around this -- the civil servants always served me well in all the roles. Whether it was the Disability Unit or DWP, things were taken very seriously.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Well, let's move on to part 2, and we can touch upon the application of that in a little bit more detail.

The first heading is around the time of lockdown or the lead-up to lockdown in March 2020, and you set out in your statement, we don't need to turn to it, that you were not directly involved in the UK Government's initial strategy in the period from January to March 2020, including the decision to use lockdown. That's correct, isn't it?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And we've heard already evidence regarding the shielding programme which was set up at pace, and that was not something that you or the Disability Unit was involved in or had input in relation to?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Not that I recall, no.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No.

In the narrative I'd like to pick up and turn to a document, INQ000187670.

This is a statement issued -- a joint statement by you and other ministers on 31 March 2020.

Perhaps if we could turn to page 2, please. And again, turn over. Lovely, thank you.

That may be a rogue reference, so we can take that off the screen.

But it's touched upon in your statement at paragraph 71, in a joint statement, late March 2020, and in that it starts off with the following text, that the government:

"... hugely values disabled people and is committed to ensuring that disabled people are supported during this challenging and worrying time."

It may chime with your recollection, and you have had a chance to see these documents beforehand:

"We will do everything in our power to ensure the needs of disabled people are addressed."

It's with that -- words of reassurance, it reflects upon the legislation which had just been implemented which had removed -- and we're not going to go into the pros or cons today, but had removed certain safeguards in relation to disabled people. Do you recall that?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: In what respect?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, in relation to the Coronavirus Act, there was certain provisions which had been lessened, safeguards which had been lessened because of the public emergency we were about to go -- experience.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah, but -- and I'm conscious we're not debating merits and demerits of things, but it was all about balance of limited resources in terms of workforce and making sure you prioritise the most vulnerable in society, because this was around social care if --

**Counsel Inquiry**: That's correct, that's exactly, yes.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Not in my realm, but that was my recollection of that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: It was a joint statement with you and the permanent Undersecretary of State for children and families, but the reassurance, which was the core message of this public statement, was that you were going to take decisive action to save as many lives as possible?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And also ensure the highest levels of support for disabled people --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- their carers and their families --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- during this challenging time?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So that's the context we have.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So that was the statement of intent.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we can move on now, around that time, the Equality Hub and the Disability Unit were reacting to events as they emerged, and isn't it right around that time a decision was made to move -- redeploy 51 members from the Disability Unit to assist with the overall response to the pandemic?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah, I mean, right across all of the areas I was responsible for.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: If you -- disability benefits, the vast majority of our frontline staff were from a medical background, so they were in huge numbers seconded to support the NHS, the vaccine roll-out, bearing in mind the benefits -- the disability benefits system was predicated on frontline physical assessments --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: -- so that presented immediate challenges. But actually within the Equality Hub a relatively small number compared to other areas of the Disability Unit were seconded and it certainly from my recollection didn't impact on our ability to carry out engagement and stakeholder work. What it will have done is perhaps some of the longer-term work -- beyond Covid, once we returned to normality -- will have had to have been paused, but certainly for the immediate challenges of Covid I didn't feel the Disability Unit were not in a position to serve out what they were --

**Counsel Inquiry**: That wasn't in your experience --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: -- wasn't an issue.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In fairness to you and the evidence we have elsewhere, there was a redeployment of staff initially, but then --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah, came back.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- the Disability Unit were re-categorised as essential staff?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah, and certainly the cohort of staff who would join me to support in stakeholder engagement, they were certainly kept.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

I'm going to move on now to 21 May 2020, and this is a paper which was prepared for the general public sector ministerial implementation group, the MIG.

It's at INQ000083584, please. This one works, which is helpful.

This was entitled "The impact of COVID-19 on disabled people."

If we could turn to page 3, please, so this is the documentation which was before the committee and there to assist you, and we see there that at page 3 "Findings", top left:

"Further data on the impact of COVID-19 on disabled people will be key in guiding our response, eg health and employment."

In terms -- if we could scroll out, please, if that's okay -- one of the actions is to start to build the data picture that measures are impacting disabled people --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- disproportionately. So we see reference there, is that there is a need for greater data.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Lady Hallett**: What's the date of this?

**Mr Keating**: This is May 2020, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Mr Keating**: We see the far right is:

"DHSC is exploring existing datasets to gain greater insights into, eg, health impacts and deaths, and extending the scope of a PHE review into the risk of an outcomes of COVID-19 to cover disabled people."

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Which we'll touch upon in a moment.

At page 5 of this document, please, "Findings":

"Accessible communications is vital ..."

Something which is a feature of your statement, you recognise.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: A need for impact assessments, and to get further insight from lived experiences.

We see here, because engagement is another theme which we have in our evidence today, and something within your statement, feedback from stakeholders, some disability groups have expressed concern about particular cohorts not being helped through the shielding programme and that members are disadvantaged because the supermarkets are offering prioritised delivery slots for shielding individuals.

That's the feedback, and we see the action there.

We've got the questions in relation to that, because I know you touch upon how you were one of the individuals which, in your role, liaised with DEFRA to help this.

Was there an issue around that time that those who were classified clinically extremely vulnerable, it omitted a significant amount of people who were also disabled and had significant vulnerabilities as well?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Is this in relation specifically to -- just in general?

**Counsel Inquiry**: In general but also that was a difficulty, was it not, in relation to shielding, how there was support for those who were shielding --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- but also there was others who were not within the category of shielding --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- and had been originally --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So there was an absolute understanding across government that those with underlying health conditions and disabilities were the most likely to be impacted by Covid in -- from a health perspective, the wider impacts of the changes in terms of lockdowns, et cetera, so across government were supportive of that principle. We were reminding people that the better quality data the more accurate they can be. And as stakeholder engagement flagged issues, generally departments were very receptive to then take that up and then adjust. At no point were things like the list, the prioritisation list, ever set in stone and will never be moved, they were always evolving. I certainly recall when we first saw sight of the vaccination priority list the DHSC were very keen to take areas that may have been missed from their initial assumptions, and work with the stakeholder groups that we had already met with, and we could then signpost to the relevant people.

In fact, in that case, Minister Zahawi actually met with the Disability Charities Consortium and they were the -- predominantly the leading health and disability charities, with many millions reach of members --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, that may be an opportunity to deal with the topic of engagement.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You mention in your statement that this was, in your view, an important part of your role --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- and that the Disability Unit worked within government --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- and with disabled people and organisations and charities, to use your words, to gain insight and encourage engagement with the government, and you set out four categories of stakeholders, which I'm going to summarise and then give you the opportunity --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah, can I just add one quick thing there?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Of course.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: The Disability Unit would flag three things. One, issues that had been raised through their meetings, stakeholder engagement including with myself. Secondly where they offered solutions themselves and could therefore help speed up the response. An example I set out in my written statement was the DEFRA's access to work -- sorry, access to food --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: -- for which a number of the Disability Charities Consortium actually joined the taskforce, and they were able to utilise what they were getting on their telephone and online forums from their members and give that valuable insight that sped up the ability for them to come up with a response. And thirdly, to test out things because of their extra knowledge. And -- and sorry, and finally, to then utilise their communications because not everybody was tuning in at the 6 o'clock daily news briefings, and many of these organisations had reach to groups of people who otherwise wouldn't have been getting the government messages. And they were seen as trusted sources.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, I'm going to take this even more shortly in relation to engagement because it's set out in your statement the four different categories and organisations which you and the Disability Unit engaged with during that period of time.

In terms of the evaluation of that, first of all, did you, in your view, find that that level of engagement to be beneficial and feed through in the decision-making?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Hugely. Every minister is different about how they conduct themselves. I've always enjoyed stakeholder engagement, I've found it makes for better policy development, it provides you with insight that even the most academic policymakers, unless they've got that lived experience, would not necessarily appreciate. They road test things. There is nothing worse for a minister than spending 18 months developing what ultimately becomes legislation for somebody to then point out something that should have been noticed at the beginning and therefore you have wasted 18 months. And in the case as I gave with the access to food taskforce, it speeds up the process, because they bring that extra level of expertise.

Now, not all stakeholders agree, and stakeholders are critical, and ultimately as the minister you have to make a judgement, that's why you're in that role, and not all stakeholders will agree with that, but I think it made for a better -- makes for better policy development. And it's something that I passionately wanted to see not just for myself as a minister, but to be embedded as a given across government.

And again, you look at all of the instances where I'm on cross-government things, I'm always pushing for better data, because you -- more accurate decisions, pushing for that engagement. Because why would you not want to have that insight, that level of challenge, that level of ideas? So it's something that I was very passionate about. And separately that then links through to the theme of the National Disability Strategy.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We will loop back towards -- at the end.

So in relation -- obviously a passion and a value placed on engagement and wish for that to be successful.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Looking back now, do you consider that there was any deficiencies or areas for improvement with that engagement in terms of including other people or was it more reactive than proactive?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: There are always challenges. There is -- as a minister, there is one of you, and I genuinely think you would be hard pressed to find a minister who probably did more stakeholder meetings. But there are thousands and thousands of disability charities, organisations, individuals, welfare advisers -- and also staff on the frontline, they often have very valuable insight to be shared. I can't, as an individual minister, be everywhere all of the time, because you also have your parliamentary business, and so we were always trying to evolve how we could meet with a diverse range.

When I first became a minister, it's fair to say -- this isn't my first time as a junior minister -- predominantly London-based organisations would get the lion's share because they could logistically come in to Westminster. And so that was the thinking behind the regional stakeholder network that we set up, because that gave an opportunity for organisations in all corners of the United Kingdom, particularly through Teams and Zoom meetings, to be able to then feed in, and you wanted to just try to get a very, very good mix.

There are never enough hours in the day to meet everybody, and some stakeholders are better than others at utilising the time that they have, and where we could see particularly good insight, particularly good suggestions, we then, through the Disability Unit, would then flag that up to the ministers and say, "These are people who can help you be better departments, better design policy, and policy that will stand the test of time".

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

So we were on 20 May, 21 May at this meeting and we have looked at documents. I'm not going to invite you to turn to the minutes of the meeting but I can summarise the minutes of that meeting once we've seen the supporting documentation. And one of the minutes was that all departments support you, the Minister for Disabled People and the Disability Unit, to ensure that their communications are fully accessible?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And secondly, all departments to consider data gaps and the impacts of Covid-19 on disabled people.

So the need for more data recognised from that.

I'd like us to move on now in the timeline, please, to the summer of 2020, and in relation to the Office of National Statistics, ONS, you refer to the work they were doing --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- in your statements -- we don't need to turn to that -- but you were not directly involved with the Disability Unit's engagement with ONS during the summer?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: No, that's operational.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm going to ask you a little bit more about how sighted you were on that work at that time. It may be operational but obviously you need to know the data and how that may impact policy.

How sighted were you as to data from ONS and how it impacted on disabled people?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So that would have been part of the -- so I would regularly meet with my officials, whether that's within DWP or the Disability Unit, and things were discussed. It was a given, not just for myself but everybody across government, that those with disabilities or long-term health conditions or any health -- underlying health conditions would be at greater risk of the impacts of Covid.

Whilst the data -- we were seeking better quality data to evidence base that, that was the working assumption across government. I do not recall a single meeting where somebody pushed back and said, "I think you're asking too much because of that". That was a presumption that was a given. It is always helpful to have more data as quickly as possible, that's what the ONS do, and we supported calls -- and we reminded government colleagues to use that as evidence based. Particularly when you are lobbying Treasury for extra money, lesson number 1 is: have evidence to support your bid.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So we have the meeting in May, the need for greater data, something as a working assumption you were mindful of the --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- adverse impacts the pandemic would have on disabled people, and we know that on 19 June ONS released data which, in broad terms, was an indicator of greater incidence of death in both male and female disability groups?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And it says, set out in very short term, that the causes are still being identified?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So there was a degree of uncertainty --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- at that stage?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's move on in the timeline now, please, to 24 September 2020 and there is a Covid-O meeting. And in relation to that we could perhaps turn to one of the papers which has been prepared that's INQ000090046, I think it's right in front of us, thank you, and this is a paper in relation to disproportionately impacted groups that was presented at this Covid-O meeting.

And we see the first part and I anticipate we will see this again, so I'm going to deal with that material shortly but not wishing to minimise its importance, it sets out the significant impact on BAME groups --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- in relation to Covid, and includes older people and disabled people there?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And it talks about that these are communities at increased risk?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And next it refers to:

"Urgent action is needed to prevent the same issues being replicated that we are facing a second wave in infections."

And that bold is not by us, that was within the document itself.

So clearly --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- urgent, pressing and the need for more information.

It says at number 2, please -- thank you -- on the same page:

"The recommendations in this paper would augment ..."

Actually it's page 2, not paragraph 2, thank you so much, if you could turn overleaf:

"The recommendations in this paper would augment and complement the work led by the Minister for Equalities in relation to COVID-19 disparities for BAME groups (commissioned following the [PHE] report published in early June), and address issues outside the remit of that work."

You will recall the PHE report that -- there was reference to that in a document we saw back in May. I want to ask you this: we know that Ms Badenoch was doing work in relation to the impact --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- in terms of ethnic minorities --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- and that that was prompted by a PHE report in June, and we have heard evidence that was updated in August 2020.

Was it the case that, as identified here, that disabled people generally, which of course would include some --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- those who are within ethnic minority groups, but was it the case that disabled people were outside that work which had been done by the Minister for Equalities at that stage?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: No, I mean, this was predominantly looking around the lower take-up of vaccinations within certain cohorts of society --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just pausing there, because I don't want you to go on a --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- for us to be at cross-purposes. This is September 2020. Are we -- we're not really in vaccine territory.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: No, in terms of the messaging getting out -- my apologies, yeah. And so this ultimately led on to identifying that the initial 6 o'clock briefings were not necessarily reaching as effectively certain cohorts of society, and this would then ultimately look at more bespoke ways, through community leaders, different ways of communicating.

And from a disability-specific perspective it was an opportunity for me to remind colleagues that -- particularly through the DCC, the Disability Charities Consortium -- their reach to their membership was many millions, and actually we should be utilising, across government, that reach to get specific messages to different groups.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Was it the case that the workstream for disabled people and finding out more information, more data, was in fact falling behind the work which was ongoing in relation to the adverse impacts on ethnic minority groups?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So my recollection is that it was the other way round, because that was already embedded into the thinking of DHSC. As I said, I don't recall ever having a meeting where people pushed back on the assumption that those with underlying health conditions or disabilities were at greater risk of the impact of Covid.

**Counsel Inquiry**: This is where we have your working assumption which --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: When I say "we", the government, society --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Of course.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: That was never in question as far as I'm aware.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just to finish the question, the working assumption you referred to, but was it the case that there was a lack of further data to assist policymakers address the needs of disabled people at that stage, in September 2020?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: I don't recall a specific in that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: It's hard. Let's work through the documents.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: I absolutely accept the point that you will always want the very best possible data. Data takes time to collect, so I'm not saying we had magical all-encompassing data at our disposal. But the fact we didn't, didn't in my mind lower the urgency that society and government, cross-government, understood around the areas of disability and health conditions.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We've got four more date points we're going to touch upon, I'm going to do those briefly, but if we go to the minutes of this meeting, which is INQ000090183, this is a -- we see, I understand, I think you were -- you are -- you are present at that meeting. We can see your name there, Mr Tomlinson, on page 1.

And the stark toll of Covid was highlighted at that meeting.

If we turn to page 5, please.

We can see that at the second paragraph there is a reference to -- you use the phraseology here:

"A BAME person was still more likely to die from coronavirus ..."

It sets that out there.

Then if we come back out, please, just scroll out, thank you, further down, the third paragraph, it says this:

"... 60% of those who had died from coronavirus identified as disabled and, even once accounting for other risk factors, disabled people were 1.6 times more likely to die from coronavirus. Individuals were 70 times more likely to die if over the age of 80, compared to those under the age of 40 ... men were twice as likely to die from coronavirus compared to women."

So breathtaking numbers but how disabled people, that large cohort, was being disproportionately impacted by coronavirus.

And that's something that you were aware of and it was influencing your work --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah, because -- I don't profess to be a medical expert but if you have an underlying health condition you are more likely to suffer the impacts of Covid, and that's seen with age, and the prevalence of disability and health conditions increases with age.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we turn to 12 November 2020, and this is where there was more work being done ahead of the next Covid-O discussion on this topic.

And if we could turn to INQ000083918, please, it sets out the context of the meeting on 27 November.

The recommendations we see:

"Data commission to understand factors driving increased mortality risk ..."

Engagement is touched upon, a national centre for digital access to assist making things more accessible as well.

If we turn to page 2, please, we see in the box:

"Available data and analysis on the question of disproportionate impacts of covid on disabled people has significant gaps ... ONS data on social impact of covid is broken down by impairment, their current mortality data does not tell us what types of disabilities (impairments) are associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19."

And it says at the bottom of that paragraph:

"We are currently not clear what is driving the increased risk."

And it says this, is that:

"These gaps mean:

"- we have insufficient information to inform COVID-19 policymaking for people with disabilities."

And:

"... if this is not addressed at pace, HMG faces a wider reputation risk of being too slow to act in spite of several credible reports of significant differential impacts."

We can see that being the third bottom bullet point.

So in this paper, real concerns being expressed within government regarding these significant gaps and talking about reputational harm, but of course, as you would say, the interests of disabled people are paramount.

What was the concern at that stage and what was being done by government in relation to trying to get more data to address this?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So everybody accepted that better quality data allowed better quality targeting. Now, whether that is the prioritisation of services, access to vaccinations, from a DWP perspective at the very beginning, to make sure that financial stability was in place, there was an extra £500 million injected into the welfare system. With improved data were all the right people being targeted? Would you have chosen smaller cohorts but offered them more of that money?

And that's what was underlying that.

The balance of that is, in the absence of absolute accurate data, there was a working assumption that those with underlying health conditions and disabilities absolutely would need that. And as time went on and data caught up, that provided more evidence to give more targeted support going forward.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The big question is: were you, was the government fast enough in commissioning that data and seeking out that data for disabled people? Or were they being forgotten or their interests not as progressed as other groups?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So, as I -- as it's not me who commissions the data -- I can't give you an absolute answer, but what I can say, in the absence of where absolute accurate perfect gold-plated data existed, it did not hold me back as a minister pushing for our share of additional support, additional prioritisation, because there was that working assumption.

And I've repeated this several times because I've also been a minister when it hasn't been Covid, and I've gone with what I think are perfectly robust and very good, positive, tangible asks to government, Treasury, and have been turned away because I don't have the evidence to back up my assumption.

In terms of asking for things, there was a very big difference between during the challenges of Covid for our asks and outside of Covid.

**Counsel Inquiry**: This is in the lead-up to a meeting on 8 December 2020, a Covid-O meeting, and you were present at that, and I'm going to summarise it. We don't need to turn to the document, but it mirrors what we've seen: concerns regarding data and mortality, for understandable reasons, one could see in relation to that, and it touches upon also the indirect impacts of Covid as well, in terms of financial and mental health, which was seen as another impact on disabled people.

And does that accord with your understanding and your engagement that those were the indirect impacts as well?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yes, absolutely.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of the recommendations, and as we -- at this stage in our timeline we've left lockdown 2, we are accelerating towards Christmas --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- and we have lockdown 3, as we now know, on the horizon.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The recommendation at Covid-O is more data --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- more testing and to help disabled people's access to use digital technology, a concern that a number -- a significant amount of disabled people were isolated and needed to be included.

In relation to that, that may be an opportunity to very briefly deal with communications.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: A lot it in your statement regarding accessible, and you say this, that the Equality Hub and the Disability Unit worked to support Cabinet Office communications to use -- your phraseology -- stakeholder knowledge to improve government communications. And you give an example about the British Sign Language, BSL, interpreter for press conferences. And in your statement, at paragraph 67(a), you recall that the product of this engagement was it was flagged to you that the British Government -- I think probably it would be the UK Government, I'm citing your statement --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- daily press conferences did not have the benefit of the BSL interpreter, whereas the Scottish press conference did.

What did you do when that was raised with you?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: This was hugely frustrating. So I've highlighted many areas where the cross-government flagging of issues, quick resolutions, positive outcomes, this was on the other end of the spectrum. This was -- right from the beginning of the stakeholder engagement this was one of the first issues that was flagged. It was flagged repeatedly not just by organisations like RNIB, though they would understandably -- it was a key issue there, but the wider stakeholder, it was very topical, it was in the national news, in Parliamentary questions, in debates, this was being issued. And for me sometimes when you're given an ask you know they're going to be difficult, they come with a big financial cost, they're complex cross-government -- this was one of those which was an easy fix and it took far too long and I to this day still do not understand why we couldn't have resolved that much quicker. It was done in the devolved --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: -- areas. And also eventually Lord Bethell sent a reply, I believe it was to RNIB, I believe --

**Counsel Inquiry**: There was correspondence --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: -- and he in effect said for social distancing reasons, but -- I get that, but it could have been done in another room and then being done -- which it was ultimately done for the online and the feeds that were provided to other news channels.

It was one of those -- it could and should have been better, no doubt about it.

And for me, hugely frustrating, because in that stakeholder engagement you've got limited time and it was one we didn't need to have to keep going over because it should have been just fixed as a given absolutely.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So drawing it together, the starting point, there wasn't a BSL signer at the outset at the press conferences, which were a very important mode of communication?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: After it was raised with you --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- it wasn't raised within government, it was raised by you that there wasn't a BSL --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- interpreter, the solution was a sort of hybrid where --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- a BSL interpreter was on BBC News --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- rather than on the main --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- BBC channel --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- at 6 o'clock, for example?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah. Should have been quicker and should have been an easy fix.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And the frustration which was conveyed to you was it felt that the needs of disabled people were not considered or were an afterthought; was that something that was conveyed to you?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: On that specific area?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: It was a frustration and I -- believe me, I shared it.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Second point, and last point in relation to communications, you had engagement with the Royal National Institute of Blind People --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- in relation to problems as to accessibility of shielding letters --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- and information, and they raised that with you and government in April 2020. That resulted in revised guidance, and it says that it led to some improvements, I think a qualified recognition that there was an improvement. Does that --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah, and they were fantastic. Government, at times, some of the communication that went out wasn't fully accessible, and organisations like RNIB and many of the others, predominantly in the Disability Charities Consortium, have fantastic policy teams, expertise, because day-to-day they're communicating with their own members in a format that is accessible to their members. And it was doubly frustrating because I would raise this at meetings and say, "Please make sure your accessible communic -- your communications are accessible". Nobody ever said, "No, minister, we want to deliberately make them unaccessible". Nobody got up in a morning to deliberately to do that. But they don't necessarily have either the expertise, and they were working at speed. And so we pushed, first of all to raise awareness, we offered the stakeholders as experts, let them check it over before it goes out, look at their guidelines, and, ultimately we managed to get a senior person inside the Cabinet Office to own this as an issue, who was well regarded by the wider stakeholders, she'd been chief executive of -- a member of the Disability Charity Consortium, and that formed the rapid accessibility contact team. Because, again, there's a balance between the urgency to get information out, and you don't want a six-week lead time to check it, the exact font size and things like that. But I wanted to make sure that that would be a given, not just during Covid, but forever more, because to me it is an area that should be a given and, again, not as much as the BSL but it was up there in frustrations of relatively easy things to fix that we could and should have done better.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Two more areas I'd like your assistance upon. We're going to be about five minutes, and then there is going to be questions from core participants to you.

We were, in this second part, dealing with the timeline, working through the need for data, we have gone through from May to summer, to September, November, December, and we have the publication of the cross-government Covid-19 disability measures which takes place on 28 January 2021. It's touched upon in your statement at paragraph 61, but perhaps we could turn to the document itself. It's INQ000083896.

This is a document which is there which references to publishing a package of cross-government measures. So INQ000083896. Thank you. So it's addressed to you, we see the dates, which I've read already, and it wants a decision by 3 February:

"... which would allow us [you] to publish in advance of the next updated estimates of Covid-19 related deaths by disability status on 11 February."

That's referring to the ONS data which took place in February 2020.

If we just scroll down a little bit more and we can see paragraph 2, and this is a good way to convey the concerns expressed externally but recognised internally within the note from your department to you.

"There was growing stakeholder driven narrative that disabled people are being forgotten and left behind throughout the pandemic."

It cites a letter to a number of ministers from SCOPE, a national organisation, in January 2020, how their work shows that "disabled people have routinely told us they have felt forgotten during the pandemic", and it talks about and refers to how a significant amount of disabled people have died of Covid.

If we scroll out a bit, please. Thank you. What it says later on in that document is this feeds into media criticism such as the "We won't be forgotten" campaign, which states one in four disabled people feel forgotten by the government, and Census, another national organisation, "Forgotten Families" campaign, which highlights the difficulties for families with children with complex needs.

Talking a lot here and just trying to draw out the recognition within the party -- within the government of the concerns regarding this, and if we move on, please, to paragraph 11, further down in that document, please, and in suggesting that -- the recommendations, it recognises the current media and stakeholder landscape on disability, and there has been a strong narrative from stakeholders echoed by the media that people feel left behind.

If we could turn overleaf, please, and it says there that there's concern about this is too little too late. We can see in the third line:

"If ministers do decide to announce, there may be some criticism in some quarters for doing too little too late."

In relation to that suggestion in the paper, were you mindful that there was concerns externally, from national disability organisations and from other stakeholder engagements, that disabled people felt left behind and what was done -- and what was done was too little too late?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So in part, through the regular stakeholder engagement, issues were flagged, some were relatively straightforward to resolve, some shaped responses, both during Covid and beyond Covid, and there were outstanding issues, and there it highlights the impact of that slowness to have the BSL interpreters as a given as part of the daily conference, and the impact of that was greater than just the people that it was directly impacting on, and it was useful at all cross-government meetings for me to then remind ministers -- that wouldn't necessarily deal with disability issues on a day-to-day basis -- that there were cohorts of the people that they would be impacting, and that there was a resource predominantly from that Disability Charities Consortium, SCOPE being highlighted, fantastic policy team, fully engaged chief executive. I met with them time and time again at different levels, so did our policy teams, and we were advocating their use. So if you were the Children's Minister, that they could bring that extra level of expertise beyond your own department's policy team, who wouldn't necessarily appreciate the knock-on impacts of wider decisions that were taken, and finally to utilise their comms network of their own so that they could present changes, particularly where there's additional support, particularly where there's opportunities to be prioritised, et cetera, through their network to make sure those messages reached. Because it is clear in a 6 o'clock briefing you can't fit everything in, and utilising those individual organisations to get very bespoke messages would then help to turn that dial on the underlying point that some people felt that they had been forgotten.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The final data point is we know in February 2021 the ONS data was announced, and we'll touch upon it in a moment, but significant higher rate of mortality for disabled people. It really goes back to the final point on this is: were you satisfied -- looking back now, and recognising the best efforts you and your colleagues in civil service were trying to do, was there sufficient visibility and insight about the impact of Covid on disabled people during the pandemic, in your view?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: In most areas. My role -- the main -- if you speak to the majority of disability stakeholders, the focus is invariably around disability benefits, at the time £13.6 billion, the logistical challenges to keep that system open, and we did that through automatic extension. So anybody who was at risk of coming off the benefit were automatically extended, providing financial stability, leaving our very finite resources to focus on new claimants, so nobody was left out, and claimants whose health condition had deteriorated so would be entitled to a higher level of financial support. And bearing in mind that this was a system predicated on physical assessments where people had to travel to a physical --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: -- assessment to bring forward initially telephone assessments and then video assessments, and that was -- the stakeholder network were absolutely fantastic in giving me fast information about whether that was working, whether we were missing people, whether there were issues, and then ultimately they then wanted it to become a permanent feature, which it did, beyond Covid. And those areas, had they gone wrong, would have been absolutely catastrophic; the same as if Universal Credit had tripped over. These were systems that took a significant chunk of our focus because of the implications were unthinkable --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just pausing there.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yep.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I need to break it up and give our stenographer a brief rest.

So in terms of your answer, you said in most places --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- there was visibility, and you --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- emphasised the importance of financial support.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And that was one of the indirect impacts --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- which was identified at a Covid-O meeting?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Visibility in most parts; where did you -- looking back now, with a view to lessons learned, where was there a lack of visibility?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So the two areas around accessible communications, because for many departments a focus on disability would be a relatively small part of their bigger packages, which was why we then pushed so hard that they utilised particularly the Disability Charities Consortium, their policy teams, their research, their live updates, feedback from their members, to make sure there weren't groups missed, things weren't designed well, and to make sure that communications were accessible. Because, as I said, that -- that was personally frustrating because, if I'm doing questions in the House, if I'm appearing at select committees, stakeholder meetings, you don't want to have to deal with things that should just be a given. You don't want to do it.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm going to follow through on my promise to give you the final opportunity to add, to assist her Ladyship in terms of lessons learned. Do you consider that there is a matter, additional matter, you want to mention which you consider is an area for recommendations or where the Inquiry can learn lessons?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Despite all of the challenges, there were benefits that came out in terms of, particularly around engagement, that ability for us to set up a regional stakeholder network, to get voices that weren't just London's -- nothing against people from London, but perhaps issues that are faced in the northeast or Wales can sometimes be different -- does genuinely make for better insight, speed up policy development, improve policy, and it was a message that I want government -- of which I'm no longer a minister -- I want the new versions of me to take as a given, to see it as an opportunity to be better ministers, to be a better government and produce better policies. And we saw that with the National Disability Strategy, we saw that with the health and disability green paper that was running alongside throughout Covid -- and in the stakeholder meetings we would invariably cover all three topics -- and also to never be precious about the agendas. It was very much, if I met with a stakeholder group it was for them to choose how they wanted to use that time, and many of the stakeholder groups would clearly put a lot of thought in and utilised that team very well, particularly around their offers, offers of, "We have an expertise in that area, disability employment for example, we can help you co-design something that will be much better", and ministers need to be receptive of that. That's why I enjoyed it, because it benefited myself as a minister and the wider government. People accepted that during Covid, and I hope that isn't being lost as we've returned to normality.

**Mr Keating**: Thank you.

They're all my questions, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Right.

**Mr Keating**: My Lady has given permission --

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, I have, and I think Mr Friedman and Ms Davies have moved so you don't get a stiff neck.

Mr Friedman is going to ask some questions.

Questions From Mr Friedman KC

**Mr Friedman**: Thank you, Mr Tomlinson. I'm asking questions for four national disabled people's organisations.

We start with the outset of the pandemic, please. You have told the chair that neither you or the Disability Unit were involved in decision-making, including around the shielding programme, from January to March. So at the outset of the pandemic, did you establish personally whether there was an existing emergency plan for disabled people?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Not that I recall.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Did there come a time when you realised what I think we know from the evidence, that there was none?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Not that I recall.

**Mr Friedman KC**: We've heard about the possible statement that was made by you and colleagues on 31 March. Just for reference, it's at paragraph 79 of your statement. We don't need to go there. I think the correct reference for the record is INQ000187624. But the essence of that was to provide reassurance to disabled people and perhaps others that were caring for them that, notwithstanding the easements and the like in the Care Act that had been brought in as a result of the coronavirus legislation, that ministers were poised to protect disabled people; that's the essence of it, isn't it?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah.

**Mr Friedman KC**: On that basis, and following on from some questioning of Lord Sedwill, why did it take until 21 May 2020 for a ministerial implementation group meeting, in this case the general public sector one, to have the impact of Covid-19 on disabled people as an agenda item?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Because that is not the only work in isolation. So, for example, disability benefits which, in the early evidence I've given, that was done straightaway, with 2.1 million people relying on either DLA, the legacy benefit, or personal independence, £13.6 billion worth of expenditure, that was done immediately alongside the changes to Universal Credit, the changes to access to work, the changes to access to carers' allowance, with the many millions of carers in this country, changing the easements. So these sorts of meetings are flagging then topical issues, outstanding issues of the time, rather than an opportunity to list things that are already in train as a given, and there were many areas across government where that was the place. Things come forward in these meetings and it's decided which is the relevant minister to represent their respective departments.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Well, I'm not going to go back on the evidence that you've given, quite thoroughly, about a satisfactory element is how everybody stood up, including you in your core job, at least the Department for Work and Pensions, and others around you to deal with benefits, and we've heard your evidence about that. But, broadly speaking, if there was a working assumption that everybody in government would know that disabled people would be at risk of both the virus itself but also the provisions brought in in response to the virus, was it too late for the key ministerial implementation group meeting to be looking at the impact on disabled people to wait until 21 May?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: No, I don't think so, because you're working on the assumption nothing was done until that point. As issues are raised, issues are fed in at speed, the whole process in responding was all done at speed across government. It is wrong to say nothing happens until a particular meeting. A meeting is a point in time where things are recorded, but issues -- and I gave the DWP examples around the disability benefits because I don't want to give you three hours' worth of evidence -- things happened before that and they were done at pace. That doesn't mean everything happened, which is why you have these meetings, to hold different departments account and to formally put in writing agreed actions, and an opportunity to challenge other departments to up their game.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Well, let's look quickly at that May document again and one last page of it, it's INQ000083584 at page 7. Bottom of page 7. Is it up? No. Sorry, we're just waiting. INQ000 -- yes.

Just at the bottom of page 7:

"Next steps are that each department develops a plan for addressing key evidence gaps and agrees to meet the Disability Unit to discuss these plans for a further meeting in about six weeks."

We have been through the rest of that document with the Chair. This is in May 2020.

Is this fair: this also is not a plan being presented to this ministerial group, it's essentially a situational summary -- I'm taking the whole document that we went through -- and at its height it's a plan to talk to departments about a plan to address key evidence gaps and in about six weeks?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: No, I don't accept that.

**Mr Friedman KC**: You don't?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: At six weeks you report back, but that doesn't mean you sit -- you agree an idea you want to do and then you sit on it for six weeks. Actions start straightaway.

**Mr Friedman KC**: No, I'm not asking you about what you're doing, I'm asking you about a plan.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Right.

**Mr Friedman KC**: And --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Same thing.

**Mr Friedman KC**: First of all, are we right, we shouldn't take this document of May 2020 as a whole, and suggest this is a plan? We can use different words, but it's essentially a means to give this ministerial group meeting situational awareness -- we have been through it already with Mr Keating -- and then it ends by saying that "In about six weeks we'll come back, and in the meantime we'll get to departments to plan to address key gaps"?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: I don't see it that -- that's a report back, but issues will have been covered in other meetings in between where they were particularly prevalent at the time. That's just not how government works.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Right.

Can I look, please, with you, briefly at your contribution to the ministerial implementation group on 21 May 2020. The reference is INQ000083626. This is the note of the meeting, and can we go to page 5, please, where we see in the bottom section what should be the summary of your part in the meeting.

Can I just draw out some aspects of what is recorded there:

"Engagement with stakeholders suggests there is a positive view of the Covid-19 response, especially the pace at which new initiatives had been put in place.

"However, this work has highlighted the lack of data across government on disability issues, an example being the DEFRA food supply work, which is subject to a data lag.

"The minister affirmed that the Covid response presents both risks and opportunities for disabled people -- some changes that would have taken years to implement in 'normal times' have been made possible very quickly.

"In terms of next steps -- the minister said more work was needed from departments to go further on evidence, and that the Disability Unit will be in touch about this."

Mr Tomlinson, our questions are along these lines: given at the outset of the pandemic there was no plan, in the sense of a coherent plan for disabled people, is this too sanguine a picture, at least in the way in which it summarised this committee? Because what is not said there is, "We have no comprehensive plan. We have been delayed in getting one. Whatever actions and successes we may have had, we absolutely need to have a plan and a package of measures now".

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Well, again you're working on the assumption that nothing has happened at this point. So, many things were able to be done at pace at the beginning, again going back to the changes to the disability benefits, changes to access to work, changes to access the carers' allowance, but it's then putting into place the work beyond this point. Nobody disagrees that's cross-government, that's departments that are maybe not used to having to think of wider or more bespoke cohorts of people that they want to support. That's the reason behind highlighting around the risks and opportunities, how some of the emergency changes that we would have made during Covid actually, through stakeholder feedback, becomes clear that they're welcome changes and actually, once we return to normality, let's keep those in place. Again, a good example of that was almost unheard of, work from home. That obviously came through in Covid, and that then opened the door to a new cohort of people who had previously not had a realistic expectation of being able to work -- this is from a disability employment perspective -- and we then wanted to then explore whether we would need to legislate to protect that going forward. But, as it turned out, in most cases employers saw that as a beneficial -- and it stayed in place. So --

**Mr Friedman KC**: I just want to interrupt, because you're talking about actions. I want to just make clear: is there a cross-government plan for disabled people in relation to the pandemic as of this time? We're in 21 May 2020. Plan, not set of actions.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Well, it's included in all of the wider government actions.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Right.

Can we then go forward to October and November in 2020, and we've already gone through the chronology. The ONS has gone through its summer work, and then there has been that meeting in September that we looked at with Mr Keating, with that breathtaking numbers of the 60% fatalities.

Can you look at the briefing for a meeting entitled "Disproportionate impacts of Covid on disabled people" prepared by the DU for you, and it's dated 30 October. It's INQ000083956.

Just on page 1, looking at paragraphs 3 and 4:

"The purpose is to discuss (i) data HMG has on disability ... and then to (ii) consider interventions that HMG could seek to implement xGovernment to tackle the disproportionate impacts that COVID-19 has on disabled people."

And this follows -- this is paragraph 4 -- a steer from the Prime Minister for much greater ambition from this work and subsequent commissions from Emran Mian -- the Chair knows about him -- from the Covid Taskforce, and a letter from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and they're in the annexes A and B.

Can we go to annex B and Mr Gove's letter. This is page 8, and this is in the briefing to you.

Now, second paragraph, it says:

"It will not now be possible to announce an ambitious package of interventions in the Minister for Equalities' oral statement, scheduled for next week, in which she will announce publication of her first quarterly report ... [on] disparities ..."

That's a reference to the work that Minister Badenoch was doing. Then it says, "This is a terrible missed opportunity", in Mr Gove's view.

Just down the bottom of the page, still page 8, internal page 7, there's the reference to the 59.2% of those who have died from Covid as being disabled.

Across to the page 9, just after the bullet points, on disproportionate impacts there's a reference to:

"Time is running out to mitigate risk for these groups in the second wave."

Then last main paragraph:

"In addition to his headline ask for more ambition, [I think that's the Prime Minister] I want you to draw your attention to his request to departments to consider options for improving outcomes for those with disabilities, ahead of a future COVID-O discussion. This is also extremely important work. I expect Secretaries of State to work with their departments to bring much more ambitious and far-reaching proposals to that discussion, as per the Prime Minister's steer."

Is it right that, in spite of that very strong steer attributed to the Prime Minister, in effect we have a situation where we're now not six weeks on from May 2021, we're several months on from May 2021 -- sorry, 2020, I apologise.

We're not six weeks on from May 2020, we're several months on from May 2020, there's been the very important issues arising for black, Asian and ethnic minority workers Minister Badenoch and Public Health England has talked about, and here we have, in this briefing to you, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Prime Minister -- and it's not a criticism obviously of you, we're looking at the system -- saying, "We just need a far more ambitious package in relation to disabled people".

Is that the best way to read what is being asked for by those two key figures as of this date, 30 October?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Well, I see it differently. I see it that the Prime Minister, the then Prime Minister, took this area very seriously and, as a minister who worked cross-government, having the Prime Minister's interest was a very powerful way to encourage other departments to act at pace and take it seriously. That underpinned the whole of the National Disability Strategy, that work that went alongside during Covid, in the sense that that really does focus other departments' minds. I found that a helpful statement, and it goes back to my earlier answer that you misunderstand how governments work. It isn't a case that you have a meeting, you discuss things and do nothing until the next meeting. It is a point in time, and work was always ongoing, and I found different government departments receptive to do things where they could, with exceptions, for example, the frustration over accessible communications, the BSL, and other things I will have highlighted in my evidence statement. So you and I --

**Mr Friedman KC**: Okay. We are disagreeing, that's fine, but let's take it further forward. The senior figures in government asked for a more ambitious package. Let's go to 5 November 2020. INQ0000839137.

This is, at the top of it, page 1, "Disproportionately impacted groups (focus on disabled people) - 27th November". It is from Emran Mian, who we know about, 5 November. We see the subject. It's copied to, amongst others, HMT, you as the Minister for Disabled People, Sarah Baker, who leads in Disability Unit matters on this, Marcus Bell, Mr Gove himself, principal secretaries to Number 10 and Cabinet Office.

I just want to show you the section on page 2, under the words "Context":

"At the 29 [November] meeting of COVID-O, the committee agreed to an ambitious package of measures to prevent transmission to and within groups that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, focusing in particular on ethnic minority communities. The Prime Minister and [Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster] also asked departments, in slower time, for a more ambitious package that can prevent disproportionate impacts from COVID-19 for people with disabilities."

I'm not asking about actions, I'm asking for a plan to produce a broad coherent cross-government package, notwithstanding the terrible data about black, Asian and ethnic minority deaths required, what is meant here by delayed planning for disabled people for a more ambitious package to work on slower time?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So you've got two things. You've got the here and now, the immediate decisions that need to be taken, whether within our direct control or cross-government; and then the wider things, for example -- again, using DWP as an example -- where we've introduced telephone and video assessments as an emergency measure, to look at whether that could then become a permanent feature, the changes to statutory sick pay, the information given to employers around working from home, the changes we've made to access to the carers' allowance. Are these features that we can then at a later date announce as ongoing permanent features? Because that goes back to my earlier point, or the earlier point that was raised around risks and opportunities, because there were -- telephone and video assessments were a part of the health and disability green paper with a realistic timeline of probably five to ten years before it could have been implemented. We had to do them as part of the emergency response to Covid. That was happening, and that would continue to happen during Covid, but then at a separate pace there was then the discussion: well, actually, this seems to be well received by stakeholders, should this now remain a permanent feature? And in some of those cases, that was easy to do because they're operation -- you carry them on; others we would then need to bring legislation forward.

And you saw, post-Covid, as we returned to normality, there was various tidying-up pieces of legislation that turned emergency government actions into permanent features --

**Mr Friedman KC**: Well --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: -- and then this would have been -- a lot of this would've been shaped by --

**Mr Friedman KC**: Mr Tomlinson --

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Hang on, hang on. A lot of this would've been shaped by the wonderful work of the various stakeholders who worked with us to give insight.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Mr Tomlinson, I'm asking you questions about what happened with the ambitious --

**Lady Hallett**: I'm afraid, Mr Friedman, I'm afraid you're running out of time --

**Mr Friedman**: I understand.

**Lady Hallett**: There's also problems with the stenographers.

**Mr Friedman**: I understand.

Let me then take you to 12 November 2020. I'm asking about the ambitious package that was called for. This is back to INQ000083918. This was -- I'll take it quickly -- at paragraph 3, the package suggested:

"3.1. Data commission to understand factors driving increased mortality ...

"... a National Panel of disabled people ..."

To formally structure the point, and:

"A National Centre for Digital Access ..."

Now, is it right -- to take it quickly -- 3.1 was not an actual organisation, it was to commission better data? How did you understand 3.1?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yeah, fine.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Pardon?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Yes.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Yes. Is it right that 3.2 and 3.3, for whatever reason, did not go through?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So 3.2 ultimately went beyond my time as the minister. I actually, when I was going through all the evidence packs, it's a question I have outstanding. I'm interested to know what did happen with that. So I can't answer that --

**Mr Friedman KC**: I think you can take it from me that it didn't.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Fine. And then, thirdly, the national centre for digital access, my recollection was that did not offer an immediate assistance and therefore would be part of normal departmental bidding for normal business. But, again, you are taking these things -- this very narrow area in isolation, ignoring the wider work, for example the continuation of the £500 million cash injection into the welfare system. That in itself would be a big announcement, but it was a given, because we understood the urgency of doing it and did it at the start.

**Mr Friedman KC**: I understand.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: You're taking things in a very narrow -- and not quite following how governments work.

**Mr Friedman KC**: Well, you've said it to me several times, and you've told me about what the DWP did. But let me then finish with this: the Badenoch investigation on disparities. First of all, what is your answer, in terms of your understanding in real time, why disabled people were not included in Minister Badenoch's investigation and what would be published reports across 2020?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: I don't know.

**Mr Friedman KC**: On that, in December 2021, in her final report -- I can just read it out -- footnote 62, at INQ000089747 at page 32, says this:

"The impact of Covid-19 on disabled people continues to be monitored across government as part of a separate strand of work to ensure the needs of disabled people are considered in the government's response to and the recovery from Covid-19."

This is December 2021, essentially going into the second wave, when the footnote was published. Is that not too late, in December 2021, to say publicly to be monitoring disproportionate impact on disabled people without a plan?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: So we've already extensively covered that in my initial set of evidence, that that -- it takes time to collate data, but it was data that was given as a working presumption across government and across society that those with underlying health conditions and disabilities would be at greater risk of the impacts of Covid. That was a given.

**Lady Hallett**: That's it, Mr Friedman, I'm sorry.

**Mr Friedman**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: You've had substantially over the time allotted.

**Mr Friedman**: Thank you, my Lady.

Thank you, Mr Tomlinson.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry.

**Mr Friedman**: No, no. Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Ms Davies.

Questions From Ms Davies KC

**Ms Davies**: My Lady, I hope the stenographer will bear with us for five minutes.

Mr Tomlinson, I'm asking questions on behalf of Southall Black Sisters and Solace Women's Aid and, as you probably know, they're part of the broader violence against women and girls sector, and so my questions are on domestic abuse and disabled people.

The Inquiry has heard expert evidence, both written and oral, that disabled adults are around three times more likely to be subject to domestic abuse than non-disabled adults are; that women, disabled women are about twice as likely to have experienced sexual violence as non-disabled women; and in oral evidence Professors Shakespeare and Watson said that the stay-at-home orders would certainly have increased the vulnerability of disabled people to domestic abuse.

Given that, in the course of your attending the different stakeholders meetings that you've told us about, talking to the stakeholders, were you ever provided with information relating to disabled women being at more risk of domestic abuse?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Not specifically, but DWP as a collective around Universal Credit, other things, Women's Aid, Refuge, other organisations had highlighted that broader point. So I would -- I'm not surprised you've said that in the sense, if it was a given for the wider population that would then include one in five people who have a disability. But that, again, would be an example of where, had that come up, had you brought that to me in a stakeholder meeting, we(?) would've then relayed that to the equivalent of myself in the Home Office and said, "There's a specific area of work to look at, if you feel that isn't already being covered by the wider work around domestic abuse". But that would have been a good example of where the Disability Unit would have then taken that and flagged that.

**Ms Davies KC**: You said "had it come up"; do you have any recollection of it coming up?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: I don't, but remember in all of the wider stakeholder meetings, I'm not present in every one of the meetings, so it could have done. I don't know how the mechanism works, they can go back and look at that. I would be surprised if it hadn't, and I certainly know it came from Women's Aid and Refuge and other organisations on the wider point about domestic violence, so I'm not surprised by what you're saying.

**Ms Davies KC**: And do you have any personal recollection -- it sounds as though you don't -- of that relaying happening to the Home Office?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: No --

**Ms Davies KC**: No.

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: -- but a huge amount will have happened through the regional(?) stakeholder network, the policy teams talking to the charities and organisations' policy teams. So there's many opportunities where something could do. If it is, there's absolutely no reason why that issue would then not have been shared and flagged. Absolutely not. That's bread and butter, exactly the sorts of issues that get taken up and then transferred to the relevant department.

**Ms Davies KC**: But you don't remember that happening?

**Mr Justin Tomlinson**: Not in the meetings that I was present, sorry.

**Ms Davies**: No. Thank you very much.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Davies.

That completes the evidence for today, I think --

**Mr Keating**: It does, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: -- Mr Keating?

**Mr Keating**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Tomlinson. Sorry to keep you until --

**The Witness**: Of course.

**Lady Hallett**: -- quite a late stage in these proceedings.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: Very well, 10 o'clock tomorrow, please.

**Mr Keating**: Thank you, my Lady.

*(4.50 pm)*

*(The hearing adjourned until 10 am on Thursday, 9 November 2023)*
