2. Professor James Nazroo
=========================

*PROFESSOR JAMES NAZROO (affirmed).*

Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry

**Mr Keith**: Please be seated. Could you commence, please, by giving us your full name.

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, my name is James Nazroo.

**Lead Inquiry**: You are in fact Professor Nazroo, so that's how I'm going to call you, if I may.

Professor, whilst you give evidence, could you please remember to keep your voice up so that we may clearly hear what you have to say, and also speak as clearly as you can so that the microphone can pick up your evidence. And also, lastly, due to the complexity of the subject matter in which you are expert, and for the rest of us who will be hearing your evidence, could you please try to keep your answers as short and succinct as you can, whilst obviously doing credit, giving sufficient credit to the subject matter.

You have been good enough to prepare for her Ladyship an expert report. Is that a report that you wrote with a professional colleague, a professor, herself, of social science and health at the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at King's College London, Professor Laia BÃ©cares?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It is.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was that report prepared by both of you?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It was.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, she's not giving evidence today with you, on account of the fact that she was unavailable to give evidence today. But when you give evidence about the subject matter of your report, will you be giving evidence in a way that's reflective of you own views or the views of both of you?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It will reflect the views of both of us. We've worked together for many years and have reached this position together.

**Lead Inquiry**: And of course you debated the many issues raised in your report when you compiled it together?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you.

That report is at INQ000280057.

Did you in fact sign that report as being a report that was prepared based on facts within your knowledge and obviously true to the best of your knowledge and belief and in accordance with your professional expert views?

**Professor James Nazroo**: I did.

**Lead Inquiry**: And you did, I think, on 15 September of 2023.

Remaining on that front page, could we start, please, with your professional qualifications. Are you a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences, a fellow of the British Academy and professor of sociology at the University of Manchester?

**Professor James Nazroo**: I am.

**Lead Inquiry**: For many years, and this is the area in which you are one of the world's leading experts, you've conducted research on issues of inequality, social justice and health, with a focus on ethnicity and race, ageing, gender, and the interrelationships, intersectionality, between these topics or these areas?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That's correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: At the end of that paragraph, you say that you're a member of the governing board of the NHS Race and Health Observatory and co-chair of its academic reference group. What is the NHS Race and Health Observatory?

**Professor James Nazroo**: The NHS Race and Health Observatory is an independent organisation located within the NHS that focuses, as its name suggests, on the relationship between race and health, and focuses on policy in relation to that, as well as evidence.

**Lead Inquiry**: How long has that observatory been in existence and how long have you been a member of the governing board?

**Professor James Nazroo**: I have been a member of the governing board since it started, and I'm now trying to remember, I think it's about 18 months that it's been in existence.

**Lead Inquiry**: Post-pandemic, in fact?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Post-pandemic, yes, indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

If we could then move over the page, please, to the preamble, so over two pages in fact, thank you very much.

I want to commence the examination of your report, please, Professor, by setting out some of the basic building blocks, the legislation that applies to the area of race equality, the comparative evidence upon which you draw, and the sources to which you make reference later in your report.

Your report in general terms addresses ethnic inequalities in the areas or the fields of health, society and the economy.

What is meant by ethnic inequality? Is that a general compendious term that refers to all the many ways in which there may be an inequality in day-to-day life, in that particular person's existence, in the resources to which they have access, the services that they receive from the state, based in some way upon their ethnic grouping?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, on the ethnic category within which they belong.

**Lead Inquiry**: This is, of course, an issue that government has paid attention to, with varying degrees of success or not, over the years. Is there in place legislation to try to promote ethnic equality?

**Professor James Nazroo**: There is, and the most recent legislation is the Equality Act of 2010.

**Lead Inquiry**: Over time, and particularly since 2010, have a variety of government bodies, including Public Health England, tried to assess, tried to -- carried out research upon and tried to assess the actual state of ethnic inequality in the United Kingdom?

**Professor James Nazroo**: They have.

**Lead Inquiry**: Public Health England prepared a report in 2018 called "Local action on health inequalities. Understanding and reducing ethnic inequalities in health". As it says in the title, that was a report concerned with health inequalities, but has government generally sought to try to address the issue of ethnic inequality across society?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So there have been a number of inquiries and investigations by government into ethnic inequalities. Many of those have focused on very specific areas like employment or policing, more recently there has been the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, chaired by Dr Sewell, which reported in 2021 and did look across the spectrum of society, so it looked at a range of features of society.

**Lead Inquiry**: What other areas of research have been carried out, or what other government bodies or non-governmental organisations have carried out research into the state of play of ethnic inequality? So the ONS, SAGE, of which we've heard of course a lot in this Inquiry, the government's own Race Disparity Unit, can you list or identify the main players in this field of research?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes. So prior to the pandemic, there were a number of endeavours examining ethnic inequalities. The Race Disparity Unit, set up within the Cabinet Office, is one example of that. In fact, perhaps a prominent example of that. Established by Theresa May, I believe, when she was Prime Minister, but had a precursor when David Cameron was Prime Minister. And that collated data from across government departments on the extent of ethnic disparity. So including education, employment, housing and so on, health.

**Lead Inquiry**: Does the government publish facts and figures that it's derived from its own research on publicly accessible websites?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, absolutely. So the Race Disparity Unit has a publicly accessible website where it presents headline figures, but also allows access to more detailed reporting on those headline figures.

**Lead Inquiry**: Are those figures in fact -- or are they published under headings such as the government's Ethnicity facts and figures website, and the government Race Disparity Audit website?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed, yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: So that's the government's own internal research, if you like.

SAGE, which we know is the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which was stood up, to use a terrible modern idiom, during the pandemic, did that have a subgroup which focused on ethnicity?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It did. So there was a SAGE Ethnicity subgroup that I believe was established autumn 2020, something like that. I think that's the correct date.

**Lead Inquiry**: You've mentioned the ONS. Does the ONS carry out sometimes year by year, on other occasions less frequently, surveys across the United Kingdom to try to evaluate or identify and evaluate the state of play?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It does indeed, yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: So does it carry out, for example, a census from time to time?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Every ten years.

**Lead Inquiry**: Every ten years. Does it carry out any censuses that are more specific? So, for example, focused on social impacts and, we'll come to this in a minute, coronavirus or ethnicity?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It carries out the annual population survey, which is a very large survey, so enables data users to say -- to examine and to say something about ethnic differences across a range of outcomes. And it carries out a number of other very important surveys, like the Labour Force Survey that we use to examine ethnicity inequalities in the labour market.

**Lead Inquiry**: After the time that in fact you were asked to look at, which was the dawn of the pandemic, preceding the pandemic, in December 2020, did the ONS carry out a survey or report called "Coronavirus and the social impacts on different ethnic groups in the UK"?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It did.

**Lead Inquiry**: And did it in 2021 carry out a census entitled "Ethnic group consensus"?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Sorry, entitled?

**Lead Inquiry**: "Ethnic group consensus 2021"?

**Professor James Nazroo**: I don't know of that report.

**Lead Inquiry**: I can say with absolute certainty, Professor, that is probably my fault, not yours. It may be that I have misled myself. But are you aware of any ONS work done by way of a census specifically focusing on ethnicity?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So in 2021 a census was carried out which includes collection of data on people's ethnicity.

**Lead Inquiry**: Ah, it just may not therefore have been entitled as I read it out.

**Professor James Nazroo**: No, so the census covers the whole population. ONS are responsible for the England and Wales census, and within that they collect data on people's ethnicity.

**Lead Inquiry**: The ONS also prepared a report on mortality, did it not?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It did.

**Lead Inquiry**: Again, was that a report that postdated the time that you were looking at, so 2021 in fact?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It did. So that report grew out of their work around ethnic differences in death rates from coronavirus, where they did some very innovative work linking death certificates to census records to estimate differences in the prevalence of risk of death or, you know, of death, and then they extended that work to examine the period prior to the coronavirus pandemic. Though, as you say, published in 2021.

**Lead Inquiry**: And importantly, that report or that survey of facts and figures addressing mortality rates was a survey or a report that focused on the links between ethnicity and mortality, so that is to say which ethnic group suffered the highest rates of mortality, whether, therefore, it would impact -- or whether you were white or whether you were a member of an ethnic group would affect the risk of mortality?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, exactly, they estimated mortality rates by ethnic group.

**Lead Inquiry**: We'll come back to that report in greater detail later, because I know you have some views on the methodology behind that report and therefore the weight which can be placed upon it.

You have mentioned Dr Sewell's report. Was that a report from 2022, March 2022, or was it March 2021?

**Professor James Nazroo**: March 2021.

**Lead Inquiry**: March 2021. And again, that's obviously a report that postdates the pandemic or the commencement of the pandemic. Was that a report which looked at, in very general terms, not just mortality but discriminatory practices, racism, the lack of access of those in ethnic groups to social and economic resources, the prejudice which they encounter and so on? So it was a very wide-ranging report?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It was a very wide-ranging report that looked across the board in terms of ethnic disparity.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, you've introduced a number of reports, the majority of which in fact postdate 2020. You were asked, were you not, to look specifically at what material was available at the commencement of the pandemic in order to be able to ascertain what decision-makers, what government would have understood the position to be when it commenced making the momentous decisions which are the subject of this Inquiry; is that correct?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: To what extent, therefore, do the later reports assist you in providing the snapshot of the position at 2020? For example, do any of those reports contain backward-looking conclusions which might be reflective in part on the position at 2020?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, so inevitably those reports look at the evidence across a wide period of time, and so therefore do contain backward-looking evidence. I did not incorporate them into my and Laia's report because they were not available at the time that the coronavirus pandemic began.

**Lead Inquiry**: Because of course the government wouldn't have known of them, they hadn't yet been produced.

But to the extent to which, if at all, you express any views on what the reality was at 2020, what the state of racism was, what the state of prejudice, the levels of prejudice were at, and the way in which members of ethnic groups were denied access to social and economic resources, any view as to what the reality was would have to be assessed in light of postdated material, because it's backward looking; is that a fair summary?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Certainly the evidence that we produce should be considered in the light of the more recent reports, indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you very much.

Because you were asked to look at what surveys were in existence and what material existed in front of decision-makers in January 2020, did you go back and look and see what material was available?

**Professor James Nazroo**: I did.

**Lead Inquiry**: If we look at the top, please, of, I think it's page 4, did you find that, and of course you were aware already, that the last health survey for England to oversample ethnic minority people had been in 2004, and the Department for Communities and Local Government's citizenship survey, which oversampled ethnic minority people and has been a key source of data, had its final round of funding in 2011?

So although there were reports, they were, at least by comparison to the post-pandemic position, fewer and further between, in part because of a lack of investment in funding?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yeah, that is correct. The health survey for England, just to clarify, is perhaps the most important annual monitoring of the health of the population. A standard survey does not contain -- because of the relatively low numbers of ethnic minority people in the population, a standard survey does not contain enough ethnic minority people to be able to examine ethnic differences. So the last time we were able to do that -- or the last time we had data to enable us to do that was in 2004. And a similar story goes with the citizenship survey. Neither of those surveys have been resourced to include ethnic minority oversamples since then.

**Lead Inquiry**: For good reasons of fairness, is it right to say that, since the pandemic, funding has become somewhat more available? I believe that more funding has been provided by the NIHR and by government and, therefore, that in part is why there have been more surveys since the pandemic than there were before?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, that's correct. Just to add one additional bit of clarification.

**Lead Inquiry**: Please.

**Professor James Nazroo**: There is also the UK Longitudinal Household Study, known as Understanding Society, which has been running throughout the period that we're talking about, so from 2010, I think, onwards, and that oversamples ethnic minority people. So that has been a very important source of data, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.

**Lead Inquiry**: And in fact you refer to that household survey in this same paragraph, alongside the references to the census in 2021, to which you've already made reference?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yeah. And as you asked, there has been additional funding since the beginning of the Covid pandemic to investigate ethnic differences.

**Lead Inquiry**: Finally, in paragraph 8, further down the page, you refer to the Public Health England report of 2018. How important, in the general scheme of things, was that report?

**Professor James Nazroo**: I believe that report was very important. It brought together existing evidence on the patterning of ethnic inequalities in health, it examined underlying causes, and made recommendations for how we might approach addressing ethnic inequalities in health.

**Lead Inquiry**: If we turn over the page, to "Topic 1: Definitions", could you please assist us with some of the basic terminology, Professor.

"Ethnicity" and "race" are words that, of course, are in extremely common use and it's not altogether clear what we always mean by them when we refer to them.

What is, in a sentence, if you can do it, ethnicity?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So ethnicity is collective identity, an affiliation to a grouping, based on ancestry, culture, religion, geographical origins, and so on.

**Lead Inquiry**: So in essence, if you'll forgive me, who they are?

**Professor James Nazroo**: One dimension of who they are.

**Lead Inquiry**: One dimension of who they are.

By contrast, is "race" a word which refers to shared physical features, most often skin colour?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes. This is how I use the term "race".

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that why racism, the social scourge that it is, is a reflection of behaviour which is outrageously and unfairly based upon, in the main, the colour of someone's skin?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Not just the colour of someone's skin. So racism also incorporates notions of cultural inferiority as well.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes, I said in the main, but yes, thank you.

At paragraph 11, you refer to racism, and you say one of the elements of racism, one of its, perhaps its most pernicious, elements, is a racist approach to a person often entails the placing of them and their cultural group on a hierarchical scale. What is meant by hierarchical scale?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So it's how we evaluate each other on the basis of our ethnicity and the notion that some ethnicities are more valued than others.

**Lead Inquiry**: And by implication, some are considered inferior to others and are therefore marginalised and excluded?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yep.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

What then are inequalities?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Inequalities are unfair outcomes as a consequence of processes related to inferiority, superiority and access to resources.

**Lead Inquiry**: The consequences?

**Professor James Nazroo**: The consequences.

**Lead Inquiry**: And in order to aid the study of this area, is racism conceptually separated into three different areas: structural, institutional and interpersonal?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yeah, so this is the approach that I take in order to understand how racism operates in our society. If we consider these three dimensions of highly interrelated processes of racism, we can then begin to identify how racism leads to unfair outcomes, how it leads to inequalities.

**Lead Inquiry**: And what is structural racism?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So structural racism is the uneven distribution of access to resources as a result of people's ethnicity or race. So by that I include things like economic resources, geographical location, cultural resources, access to political resources and so on.

**Lead Inquiry**: It's structural because it focuses upon the way in which society and its structures, governmental, commercial, and otherwise, fail to give proper access?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It's structural because of the ways in which social structures constrain access to certain resources. These aren't necessarily the direct actions of particular organisations or individuals.

**Lead Inquiry**: But it's across society?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It's across society.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

Institutional racism, is that a reflection of the processes and procedures within institutional settings?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: And is interpersonal racism, as would appear to be the case from the word "interpersonal", a reference to everyday encounters of racism? Which, as what we might all see as the most obvious, through our personal experiences, is personal prejudice, hence interpersonal?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, and this is how most of us see and recognise racism.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

Now, paragraph 14, please, page 7.

You then turn to the heart of the report, which is what was the position relating to ethnic inequalities in health prior to January 2020, for the purposes of setting, of course, the building block for what the position was that confronted government decision-makers on the cusp of the pandemic.

Do you conclude, in very general terms, in paragraph 15, that ethnic inequalities in health have been long-standing and persistent? Have they been documented, for example, for many years?

**Professor James Nazroo**: They have been documented for several decades.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was there a greater amount of documentation and survey and research in the years leading up to January 2020 or less?

**Professor James Nazroo**: In the decade or so leading up to January 2020, there was less total population examination of ethnic inequalities in health.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was that in the main because, as you've said earlier, the last health survey hadn't been -- there hadn't been one since 2004, and there had been an underinvestment in data generally with regards to ethnic minority monitoring?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed. And as I've argued earlier, or as I said earlier, the Health Survey for England I think is an absolutely crucial resource for documenting inequalities in health.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that the report you refer to at paragraph 17 and which you've already spoken of already?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That's the Health Survey for England I refer to in paragraph 16. The Public Health England report brought together evidence from a range of sources.

**Lead Inquiry**: You've referred to the census carried out by the ONS and in particular the 2011 census which preceded the pandemic, the 2021 was later, of course. A census depends, of course, on every recipient or contributor self-reporting information. To what extent does the information that can be extracted from a census have to be assessed in light of the fact that it's self-reported? Putting it another way, can the same weight be placed on self-reported data as objectively observed data?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So, this is a very important topic. There has been some investigation into how far measured disease correlates with self-reported health, and how far that varies across ethnic groups. The bottom line of this is that for the two crucial questions in the census, they both correlate very well with risk of mortality and with risk of having a diagnosed disease, and that correlation does not appear to vary dramatically across ethnic groups or meaningfully across ethnic groups.

**Lead Inquiry**: If I may say so, I think that's admirably clear. I'll probably bring confusion in where it's not warranted, but in essence, therefore, what you're saying is the figures which are self-reported by people who contribute to a census and respond to a census, they're consistent with objectively verifiable levels of mortality, the risk of death, in ethnic grouping, and also with the objectively verifiable information relating to disease?

**Professor James Nazroo**: They are.

**Lead Inquiry**: What that census material shows is that over time ethnic inequalities in health have been persistent, and therefore that some ethnic groups, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean groups and , among women, the Indian group, have higher rates of long-term illness than the white ethnic group?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, that's correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: Can I bring you back to the post-pandemic ONS data of 2021, which I said I would, was that a report that focused on mortality rates?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It was, and subsequently on life expectancy.

**Lead Inquiry**: And was that report, post-pandemic as it was, consistent, in your opinion, with the pre-pandemic material, the census material, the Public Health England material, the Longitudinal survey and so on, in terms of the persistency of ethnic inequality in health?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, so that report covered a period prior to the pandemic, so the period that we're talking about in terms of the evidence that we've presented in the document, and again the bottom line is it was not consistent with that evidence.

**Lead Inquiry**: So the post-pandemic ONS survey, although it was backward facing in terms of relying upon data from 2012 to 2019, reached a different general conclusion from the earlier material?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That's correct, the conclusion it reached was that the life expectancy of white people was lower than the life expectancy of ethnic minority people, suggesting white people had worse health, and that the mortality risk for white people, consistent with what I've just said about life expectancy, were higher for white people compared with ethnic minority people.

**Lead Inquiry**: The conclusion of that report was that the white group had a statistically significantly elevated all-cause mortality when compared to all other ethnic groups, so in practice, in reality, because of the prevalence of dementia, Alzheimer's and cancer in white groups, they concluded or the ONS concluded that the risk of death was higher, generally speaking, across the white group than it was for ethnic minority groups; is that the sum of it?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That's the conclusion of the report.

**Lead Inquiry**: But you have concerns about the methodology of that report; is that right?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: Could you just briefly summarise what concerns you have and therefore what concerns you have about the validity of the conclusions that the ONS reached?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes. So the report itself was based on very innovative analysis. I'm not sure whether people are aware, but on death certificates we do not record ethnicity. So we know whether people have died but we don't know their ethnicity. So what the ONS did, and they did this as part of pandemic research that they conducted, was to link death certificate data to census data and to NHS records. Census data and NHS records do contain data on ethnicity, so they were then able to estimate risk of death by ethnicity. This is incredibly innovative work, and -- yeah, and difficult work to do.

My concerns with this really began when I saw the inconsistency between the mortality rates and what we knew about morbidity or health levels. When I looked a little bit closer, I saw that some of the estimates of life expectancy and of mortality rates were rather unusual. For example, the life expectancy of an 80-year old Pakistani or Bangladeshi woman is considerably longer than the life expectancy of a Japanese woman of a similar age. And I use Japan as the example because Japan has long life expectancies, considerably longer.

So when you see that, you begin to wonder whether the data are correct.

The reason why the data may not be correct is because of the linkage of administrative records, so that some deaths may not be accurately linked to census records, so then deaths become undercounted. And that means that some people become statistically immortal, they never die, in the statistical record.

We are working with -- or "we", me and colleagues are working with ONS to explore the consequences of that, but we believe that that does raise questions about the conclusions that they reach.

The data themselves are also published as experimental statistics, which means that the statistical underpinnings of the analysis have not yet been gold standard.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Professor James Nazroo**: We need to treat them with some caution.

**Lead Inquiry**: So, quite properly, there are issues raised about the methodology and the statistical validity of the material, which you in fact, and I think you're looking at this for the ONS, will no doubt research and opine upon in due course. Is it the position that therefore the conclusions from the ONS post-pandemic may or may not prove in the fullness of time to be accurate, we just don't know?

**Professor James Nazroo**: We don't know.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

But what that shows is there is at least an issue as to whether or not there had been changes both in the levels of access to health services amongst ethnic groups, levels of mortality and health inequalities, over time, perhaps, before the pandemic, we just don't know to what extent, if at all, there were?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So the data on morbidity, on health, on disease and so on suggests consistency over time, that the inequalities have persisted over time. The data on mortality are backward looking, as you've described them, which means that they are also consistent over time. So that backward look is also consistent with a more recent analysis that was conducted using data since the 2021 census.

**Lead Inquiry**: On mortality?

**Professor James Nazroo**: On mortality.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

**Professor James Nazroo**: But, as I have suggested, my opinion is that there are statistical problems with those analyses.

**Lead Inquiry**: At paragraphs 21 and 22, you conclude, as a result of your examination, that ethnic inequalities in health are also more pronounced at older ages, and you give some details or some examples of why that is so, and you also say, in paragraph 22, that:

"Inequalities across ethnic groups begin to emerge in middle adulthood and for three [particular] groups - Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Black Caribbean people ..."

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: You produced a chart -- on the following page, please, if we could just scroll in, please, on that chart -- does this show ethnic differences in fair or poor self-reported health by age? So these are the recipients of the surveys and the contributors indicating themselves where they have fair or poor health?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That is correct, yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: And we can see Bangladeshi at the top, Pakistani second there, underneath, and then -- my eyesight will probably betray me -- black Caribbean third and white British at the bottom?

**Professor James Nazroo**: White British not quite at the bottom, white British are the yellow line in the chart, and you can there are two or three lines that are not much different from them.

**Lead Inquiry**: They are at the bottom, they're just not very far from the bottom from the other two above them.

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yeah, so the black African and Chinese levels of self-reported health are pretty similar to those for white British people across the age range.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right. You then went on to look at the position in relation to specific diseases, and obviously in the population at large there are a number of chronic conditions such as diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and stroke and so on and so forth. What, in very general terms, did you conclude in relation to specific disease outcomes? And by "outcomes" I mean the extent to which people self-reported the existence of and the suffering from specific diseases.

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yeah, so the picture does become complicated because specific diseases have specific -- have differences in prevalence across ethnic groups that don't immediately parallel -- each disease doesn't immediately parallel the other. But in general terms, in high-level terms, the risk of chronic conditions are higher -- the risk of a diagnosis with a chronic condition is higher amongst ethnic minority people than white British people, in general terms.

**Lead Inquiry**: Topic 3, on the following page, page 10, "Ethnic inequalities in access to healthcare", is this the topic of the extent to which members of any particular ethnic group might go to a GP or a hospital and seek medical care?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That's correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: Are there differences between ethnic groups as to how likely it is that people use GP services than not?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Apart from the Chinese group and the white Gypsy and Irish traveller group, ethnic minority people are more likely to use a GP than white British people.

**Lead Inquiry**: And how indicative is that of the need for medical treatment as opposed to a propensity or a disinclination to want to seek help?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It at least in part reflects the need for more treatment.

**Lead Inquiry**: But not wholly?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It's a very difficult statistical exercise to be able to take into account the whole of need in terms of healthcare. When you take it into account as far as you can, it explains some of the difference, some of the higher rate, which suggests that need is at least one of the drivers of this.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes. In essence, it must be a factor?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It is a factor.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes. All right.

You also referred to a Public Health report in 2018 which expresses the view that ethnic minority groups report lower satisfaction with primary and secondary healthcare, and you also refer to the particular field of maternal and neonatal healthcare, where ethnic minority women experience less good communication with providers and also delays in antenatal care?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That is correct, the Public Health England report, in paragraph 28, brings together evidence from a large number of studies. The work on maternal and neonatal morbidity has been done by a handful of studies.

**Lead Inquiry**: Lastly under this section, at 31 and 33, you deal with the issue of access to mental health services. 31:

"... ethnic minority people are more likely than White people to experience high rates of admissions involving the police, less likely to be referred to by a GP ..."

For mental health services.

And, 33, there are ethnic inequalities in relation to young people in addition, particularly black young people, who are more likely to be referred through education, mental health services, social care, relative to primary care?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That is correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. Well, I'm not going to ask you any more questions about that, because, if I may say so, you've set it out very clearly and your conclusions are self-evident in those paragraphs.

Topic 4, social and economic resources. What is, what are social and economic resources?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So here I -- or we refer to things like housing, employment, education, yeah, et cetera.

**Lead Inquiry**: Over time, has there been a persistent inequality in terms of those resources?

**Professor James Nazroo**: The evidence we summarise strongly suggests that that inequality has been persistent. Is present and has been persistent.

**Lead Inquiry**: And that's across the whole range of economic activity, so employment, income, educational outcomes, housing, area deprivation, discrimination and so on, this is a huge area.

**Professor James Nazroo**: It is a huge area, but those inequalities are persistent. There is variation in the detail, of course, but those inequalities are persistent.

**Lead Inquiry**: To what extent does an individual or have individual surveys or censuses tried to unpick the individual areas which are grouped in the area of social and economic resources? So are there specific surveys dealing with just housing, for example, or just employment, or is this information which has to be extracted from a much larger body of data?

**Professor James Nazroo**: There are specific studies around housing, specific studies around employment, specific studies around health and so on, but the census, perhaps one of the most useful tools or one of the most useful sources of data, does cover a number of these dimensions jointly.

**Lead Inquiry**: Of particular importance to this Inquiry is, of course, employment, because the figures appear to indicate, and they're very clear, that certain people in certain jobs were more at risk of being infected, depended of course on whether they were on the frontline of healthcare or whether they were delivering public services which required them to come into contact with other people who might be infected, so employment and the nature of employment, whether it's part or full-time and what sort of employment it is, is of great importance.

What general conclusions did you reach in relation to the risk of unemployment, firstly?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So the risk of unemployment is higher in ethnic minority groups, not all of them, but it is higher in ethnic minority groups, and that higher rate has largely remained persistent over time.

**Lead Inquiry**: Do you reach the view that it's remained persistent because the rates of unemployment in ethnic groups are still there, despite the fact that ethnic minority populations now have a large proportion of second and third generation people within them and therefore might otherwise be expected to have enjoyed better prospects?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed, we would expect -- I would have expected over time for ethnic inequalities in things like employment to have diminished because the resources that we sell as we apply for jobs, the inequalities in those resources should have reduced over time, across generations and over time.

**Lead Inquiry**: The government has made the point in the response to your report, by way of what's called a Rule 10(4) submission, that since the pandemic -- and again emphasising that you were looking at the position as at 2020 here -- since the pandemic there is some material, in particular an annual population survey in 2021, which suggests that the risk of unemployment or the levels of unemployment are narrowing. Would you agree or not?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So I would qualify the statement. The levels of unemployment are reducing, the gap between ethnic minority people and white British people has remained. And it's also important to recognise that one of the crucial dimensions of employment is not just having a job but the type of job you have, and so that actual -- those data do not tell us much about part-time employment, for example, and the dramatic move of some ethnic minority groups into part-time employment from full-time employment.

**Lead Inquiry**: So in essence, that proposition, whilst it might well be right in part, doesn't tell the full story, that's what you would say?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Doesn't tell the full story and I think the headline conclusion, that ethnic inequalities are diminishing, is not the correct conclusion.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes. I think to be fair to them, I actually put it in a different way, Professor, I said they suggest that the gap in levels of unemployment is lowering or reducing, which isn't what you've described it as.

**Professor James Nazroo**: Okay.

**Lead Inquiry**: Paragraph 36, you then deal with the point which you've just raised, which is the type of work. So are there ethnic differences in the employment profile of ethnic minority people? That is to say, are they employed in sectors that may increase the risk of exposure to an infectious agent, such as transport, delivery jobs, healthcare assistants, hospital cleaners, social care workers, nursing and medical jobs and the like?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That is correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: Can you give us any figures or a closer indication of the proportion of employment undertaken by ethnic minority people which is in those sectors?

**Professor James Nazroo**: I'm sorry, I don't have those figures off the top of my head, and I don't have a note in relation to those figures, but I think it has been very well documented in a number of sources that these are the locations where ethnic minority people are more concentrated and ... yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Housing. Relevant to this Inquiry because of the greater risk of infection in a multigenerational household, and that's obviously relevant to the governmental decision-making as to how restrictions and lockdowns were imposed and what the impact would be on such housing. Are there conclusions that you can draw in relation to the proportion of people in ethnic minority groups who live in multigenerational households or overcrowded households, or households which are seen as deprived because of lack of central heating and so on and so forth?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So that is the case for some ethnic minority groups, they're more likely to be in poor quality housing, more likely to be in the private rental sector, which runs the risk of poorer quality housing, and more precarious housing, and more likely to be in overcrowded houses than white British people. This is not across all ethnic minority groups, but it's the case for some ethnic minority groups.

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Keith, I don't know how your timing is going?

**Mr Keith**: That's a very good moment.

**Lady Hallett**: Very well, I shall return at quarter to.

*(11.30 am)*

*(A short break)*

*(11.45 am)*

**Mr Keith**: Professor, higher pollution levels, are ethnic minority groups more likely than white majority groups to live in deprived neighbourhoods with higher pollution levels?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: And are ethnic minority groups more likely than the general population to experience digital exclusion?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Some ethnic minority groups, not all.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: You said "some" more than once. Are we always talking about the same minority groups that are featuring at the lowest point, the percentage points, or are we talking about different ones?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, my Lady, there are three groups that are particularly vulnerable, according to the general data we have, which are the Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean group. You have less coverage of a very vulnerable group, which is the white Gypsy/traveller/Roma group.

**Lady Hallett**: Is that in any way related to the difficulty in getting data from them because they don't always have a permanent base, or ...

**Professor James Nazroo**: I think it -- my view is that it relates to our willingness to reach out, to get to those people. But I accept it's more complicated.

**Mr Keith**: The evidence, in part your own evidence, indicates that there is another group of people who are digitally excluded, and that is the elderly.

Are you in a position to draw any view, to express an opinion as to comparatively what the levels of digital exclusion are between some ethnic minority groups and the elderly?

You will look in vain at that paragraph, Professor, I'm afraid I've bowled you a difficult ball, it's not in that paragraph.

**Professor James Nazroo**: So the evidence we have in terms of older ethnic minority people and digital exclusion cannot be easily derived from survey data, simply because of the very small number of older ethnic minority people who appear in surveys. Qualitative research suggests that older ethnic minority people are particularly at risk of digital exclusion. But, as you say, I haven't reported ...

**Lead Inquiry**: And that's not a surprising conclusion at all?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It's not a surprising conclusion.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

Topic 5, the role of racism. Bearing in mind what you said earlier about the definitional differences between structural, institutional and interpersonal racism, do you conclude that ethnicity remains strongly associated with social location, status and power, leading to inequalities in access to the resources that you've described, because of ongoing structural racism?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That is my opinion.

**Lead Inquiry**: In essence, at its most basic, access to resources is more limited for members of its groups because they are members of those groups; is that it?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Because of the way society is organised and the consequences of that for members of those ethnic groups.

**Lead Inquiry**: In relation to interpersonal racism, that is to say acts of racism in everyday life, everyday lives, can you say anything about the level of interpersonal racism over time in the United Kingdom?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Measuring the level of interpersonal racism is extremely complicated. The ways in which we phrase questions, the ways in which they're interpreted makes it difficult to capture all dimensions of interpersonal racism. But the headline response to your question is that it appears that levels of interpersonal racism on average have remained consistent over time.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, there are a number of different ways in which levels of racism might be surveyed or monitored, the most important is the self-reported surveys where members of the ethnic minorities report on the degree to which they have experienced racist abuse, assault or vandalism; is that correct?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That's correct, that's the measure has been used quite consistently over time.

**Lead Inquiry**: From what time period do those sorts of reports date upon which you place reliance for your conclusion that there had been a persistence of racism over time?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So they were first used on a national level in 1993/4, the survey was carried out in 1993/4, and were repeated in a few surveys subsequently.

**Lead Inquiry**: What dates were those subsequent surveys?

**Professor James Nazroo**: I'd need to look at my chart here, 2001 and 2008, I believe, those ...

**Lead Inquiry**: Then were there further reports or further surveys thereafter, or is the last survey upon which you place reliance that year in 2008?

**Professor James Nazroo**: The last survey that used that wording of the question. There have been other surveys that have continued to collect data on experiences of racism and discrimination, most notably the survey I referred to earlier, Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study.

**Lead Inquiry**: And when was the longitudinal household survey?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That started I believe in 2010, and it's an annual survey, but it doesn't collect the measures of racism every year.

**Lead Inquiry**: It does?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It does not. It does it every few years.

**Lead Inquiry**: So would it be fair to say that the primary material, the primary surveys upon which you've placed reliance -- and it is of course because that is all that there is -- is a little dated by the viewpoint of 2020?

**Professor James Nazroo**: The pattern over time is a little dated. The pattern over time that I present in the report is a little dated.

**Lead Inquiry**: You properly identify, and we can go to the next page, figure 3, what the impact is of those reports in the surveys, which is that -- if you could scroll into the charts, thank you very much.

The solid line indicates self-reported acts of racism. That is to say, members of the ethnic groups that you identify, Pakistani, black Caribbean and Irish, have experienced racism, and they're the solid groups. And we can see in the bottom right-hand half of the page a fairly persistent line, because the lines are horizontal, perhaps less persistent in the case of the Irish, but over time from 1991 to 2008, which is the last survey you mentioned. Those figures have remained fairly constant.

Then there's self-reported fear of racism, which has remained constant in the case of black Caribbean people. In the case of Pakistani people, the fear of racism has gone up.

What is the top line, starting on the left at 1983, by comparison to fear of racism or experience of racism?

**Professor James Nazroo**: The top line reflects the general population's responses to a question asking whether they are prejudiced against ethnic minority people, and it shows how that rate has changed from 1983 through to 2013. Each square is the period when the data were collected, and you can see it was collected quite frequently in the early phase of this and less frequently in the later phase, and it basically shows, in my view, a fairly consistent level of reporting that you are prejudiced, that ranges between 30% and 40% over this time period.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, it's obvious that the figures must to some extent, because they're -- the asking of anybody the question "Are you prejudiced?" of course may not elicit an entirely truthful answer, so is that an issue which is taken into account in this survey or this approach?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It's an issue that needs to be taken account of in terms of the interpretation of responses to this question.

**Lady Hallett**: Because an awful lot of people don't know that they're prejudiced when they are?

**Professor James Nazroo**: And the willingness to admit you're prejudiced in front of an interviewer is also going to vary.

**Mr Keith**: So the figures of actual prejudice could be higher because of under-reporting, or if you ask the question to what degree do they know that they're prejudiced the figure could be lower because of a failure to identify that they are prejudiced?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That's correct, and it's also important to bear in mind how those issues may change over time.

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed.

What survey does the blue block in 2013 for prejudice signify? What survey is that? Because that's in 2013, but the earlier surveys for all the other indices, indicia, are different.

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yeah, so the data for each of these lines comes from a range of surveys. The only consistent line is the blue line at the top on prejudice, which comes from the British Social Attitudes Survey, which is repeated every year, although the question on prejudice is not repeated every year.

**Lead Inquiry**: And was the last year in which that question was contained in the survey 2013, which is why there's a block on the chart?

**Professor James Nazroo**: At the time we did this analysis, that was the last --

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

So the last objective or quantifiable data underpinning your conclusions is from 2013?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

The reason I ask, Professor, as you know, is that in the submissions put forward to the Inquiry the government says: well, what about other surveys or data from 2013 to 2020, and also what about surveys post-pandemic which may be reflective of levels of prejudice pre-pandemic?

Do you follow?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is there really an absence of data 2013 to 2020? Was the research and the surveys simply not done?

**Professor James Nazroo**: As I mentioned earlier, there is this crucial survey called Understanding Society which has continued throughout this period and over that period has intermittently asked questions on racism and discrimination. Those questions are different from the questions that I charted in this figure, which is why they're not included in this figure, because the way you ask the question is crucial. But what it shows is that ethnic minority people continue to report experiences of racism and discrimination up to the period of the pandemic, and the levels at which they report this doesn't change very much over that period.

Post-pandemic there have been additional surveys conducted on this question.

**Lead Inquiry**: The government refers in particular to something called the World Values Survey, I think it's April 2023, earlier this year, but in any event that survey suggests that of 18 countries, one of the least prejudiced -- and I'll come to the significance of this in a moment, of course -- one of the least prejudiced is the United Kingdom. The survey reports that only 1% of the United Kingdom public say that they would wish to live next door to a neighbour of a different ethnic group.

That is a comparative survey, we don't know on what it was based, and it obviously says something to the general advantage of the United Kingdom.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry, is that they would wish to live next door or they wouldn't?

**Mr Keith**: 1% say they would not like to -- sorry, did I miss out the "not"?

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, you did.

**Mr Keith**: I do apologise.

Did it say anything about the levels of prejudice, objective levels of prejudice in the United Kingdom, as opposed to saying something, and perhaps not very much, about the comparative position of the United Kingdom?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So the World Values Survey is actually a very important survey, that enables us to explore attitudes across the globe. It includes very many countries, and so enables us to position attitudes held in the United Kingdom alongside attitudes held in other countries. So for that purpose it's a very valuable survey.

That question is a very specific question that captures just one dimension of people's experiences, or people's prejudicial views. So to generalise from that one question to a broader dimension of prejudice against ethnic minorities I think is a bit of a stretch, but there are important conceptual and methodological issues related to that, but I would not use that as an indicator that levels of prejudice have decreased.

**Lead Inquiry**: Finally, the issue of institutional racism, upon which we have not touched in this context, is there a difficulty in separating out the degree of racism that comes from individuals on an interpersonal basis and the extent to which racism is perhaps baked into the institutions of which those individuals form part?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes. So although I've talked about the difficulties of measuring interpersonal experiences of racism, these are straightforward experiences, therefore you can design questions to capture that. In terms of institutional racism and structural racism, you can't ask people questions about this in a direct way, you have to ask about the consequences of racism. So in terms of structural racism, you can see the consequences, in terms of the resources that people have access to. In terms of institutional racism, you can see it operating in terms of the processes and outcomes of the actions of institutions.

**Lead Inquiry**: Topic 6, the role of cultural and genetic difference. In this chapter, do you investigate the argument put forward by some that differences in access to health resources and, on a wider sense, ethnic inequality in health, that is to say the risk of disease, mortality rates and so on, are in some way connected to the cultural or genetic characteristics of that person? So, putting it another way, saying a Chinese person is more likely to have a worse health outcome in general terms because genetically he or she is more prone to cancer, that sort of argument. Is that the argument which underpins this argument about cultural and genetic differences and their impact?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, we felt it very important to discuss this topic, for perhaps very obvious reasons. Genetics and health behaviours, culturally informed health behaviours, inevitably impact on our health. And we assume, we make the assumption in everyday thinking, that health is a biological outcome and therefore genetic and cultural differences across ethnic groups may lead to ethnic differences in health.

It's a common lay approach to thinking about why ethnic groups might have a higher risk of poor health, so we felt it important to discuss this.

**Lead Inquiry**: And is the problem here that the argument, as I've so defined it, is insufficiently nuanced? It's too bold, too broad brush an approach? Plainly there may be some ethnic groups who do suffer more widely from particular diseases.

The fallacy or the flaw in this approach is to make broad or to draw broad conclusions about differences between ethnic groups in the hope, foolishly, that that will assist in identifying health treatment, for example saying, "Well, why don't we give vitamin D to particular segments of the population because they are drawn from particular ethnic groups", is that the fallacy, is that the wrongful approach?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yeah, the fallacy is to look at an association and to take a common sense approach to understanding the causes of that association without investigating it.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right. So in fact it's in that category of proposition, equally flawed, to the effect of, for example, the sole driver of worse health outcome is ethnicity?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: The truth is it is a far more sophisticated and complex debate, ethnicity is related to deprivation, geography, housing, exposure to risk and racism, and as a result of all those features, based in part upon ethnicity, you can say ethnic grouping is relevant to the health outcome?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

Topic 7, implications of ethnic inequalities for risk of infection and mortality during a pandemic. Do you conclude in paragraph 62 that because of the inequalities that you've described, including the stress generated by experiences of and knowledge of racism, higher levels of chronic disease, which, as we've explored, is prevalent or is present in some ethnic groups, and early onset of biological ageing, ethnic minority people are more at risk?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed, including the social and economic inequalities faced by ethnic minority people.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just picking apart that proposition in part, are there any figures showing the degree of stress or are there figures other than self-reported stress upon which you have been able to rely for the purposes of assessing that degree of stress?

**Professor James Nazroo**: There have been studies that have examined biological stress responses to experiences of racism which show the rise in those biological responses when people are exposed to narratives of racism.

**Lead Inquiry**: Do we presume that it is not possible to delineate the degree to which any one of those factors may be a greater contributory factor than any of the others? So, for example, are the pre-existing social, economic and health inequalities that you've described likely to be the greater contributory factor to the risk of serious illness and mortality rather than stress or biological ageing?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So these processes are intimately related to each other, so pre-existing social and economic inequalities are the driver of higher levels of chronic disease and also a driver of earlier onset of biological ageing. And racism is part of the set of processes that lead to the social and economic inequalities, as well as having a direct effect on people's biology.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, beginning to draw the threads together, topic 8, the implications of ethnic inequalities for adverse outcomes resulting from non-pharmaceutical interventions, that is to say government steps that are not drug or vaccine-related, so social restrictions, lockdowns and so on.

You set out some of the indicia of inequality: poorer quality and overcrowded housing, lack of access to digital devices, broadband, dislocation from education, the types of employment, the greater levels of unemployment and so on. All the features that you've described already.

Do you set them out here in order to make, if I may say so, the relatively straightforward proposition which is that all these issues, all these indicia of inequality, have a direct bearing on the impact of any particular non-pharmaceutical intervention that any government might impose?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed, the pre-existing inequalities mean that those interventions are likely to have a more adverse impact on ethnic minority people.

**Lead Inquiry**: You then go on to deal with two particular examples of where clinical interventions have a different outcome because of ethnicity. Firstly, pulse oximetry. What is pulse oximetry?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Pulse oximetry is a convenient device that can be used to measure the level of oxygen saturation in the blood, and therefore an indicator of the beginnings of respiratory failure.

**Lead Inquiry**: And do pulse oximeters rely upon, mechanically, the transmission of light through the skin?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Exactly.

**Lead Inquiry**: On account of ethnicity, are there differences in the way in which pulse oximetry may work?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So there is extensive evidence, some from before the pandemic and since the pandemic occurred, which demonstrates that pulse oximeters do not work as well on darker skin, they're more inaccurate.

**Lead Inquiry**: Because in the health service pulse oximetry is a particularly valuable indicator for people who are older, there is an impact insofar as the cut-off date for age under which the NHS won't therefore generally use pulse oximetry ought to be re-examined in the case of its groups because, as you say, there are differences of outcome on account of differences in skin colour?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So that's not quite the proposition that we -- or the opinion that we express in this document. The opinion is two-fold. One is that pulse oximeters are less accurate in darker skin, so if you use them to make clinical judgments then you need to either design new devices or take that into account.

The other argument is that if you have an age cut-off for the use of an intervention, then you need to take into account the earlier biological ageing of ethnic minority people. So, as we documented, a 50-year old Bangladeshi is not the same as a 50-year old white British person on average.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right, that's very clear, thank you.

The second area that you address in terms of clinical intervention is the roll-out of vaccines. You say at paragraph 82:

"Given the existing evidence on vaccine hesitancy ..."

More dedicated effort should be made to "address the concerns of ethnic minority people".

Although you say "given the existing evidence", did you mean by that reference in fact the position as at 2020?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. May we take it -- I mean, I think we're all aware that a great deal of work was done in relation to addressing vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic. Did the Minister for Equalities, Kemi Badenoch MP, in fact produce a number of reports trying to address the problem of vaccine hesitancy?

**Professor James Nazroo**: She did, once government became aware that this was an issue.

**Lead Inquiry**: The last topic in your report is topic 10, missed opportunities. Do you set out in that paragraph the areas in which you believe the government should have done more to try to tailor its interventions and its responses taking into account the inequalities that you've described in your report?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, this is an attempt to provide a high-level summary of the considerations that government and decision-makers generally could have taken in the light of evidence that was available prior to the pandemic.

**Lead Inquiry**: To what extent -- are you aware, you may not know, but to what extent did various parts of the government, for example SAGE, Public Health England, the UKHSA, or the Health and Safety Executive, or the Faculty of Occupational Medicine, attempt to address any of these issues as the pandemic rolled on?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So once it became apparent that ethnic minority people were dying at higher rates from Covid infection --

**Lead Inquiry**: Can I just pause you there, can you express a view as to when that generally became understood?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So it became visible in the general media in March and April, if I remember correctly, March and April 2020.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you.

**Professor James Nazroo**: Research began under way around that time, with a number of non-government agencies doing research, including Professor BÃ©cares and myself. Data was difficult but we and others did some work to illustrate the extent of ethnic inequality and risk of mortality, and then ONS began to gear up to do this in a much more robust way.

But I think from those early days, public health responses recognised the higher risk amongst ethnic minority people and began to try and do things about that.

**Lead Inquiry**: You say "public health responses"; do you mean bodies within and without government?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: So across the whole range, in fact, of this field.

So when you express your views as to what more could have been done, do you express those views in light of what was done or do you restrict yourself to identifying conceptually where the problem areas were, as at the position in 2020?

**Professor James Nazroo**: So this is where the problem areas were at the outset of the pandemic, and the issues that should have been considered when things like non-pharmaceutical interventions were put in place.

**Lead Inquiry**: Regardless of the extent to which they were thereafter considered, if they were considered at all?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Regardless of whether they were considered afterwards.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right, thank you, that's very clear.

So you identify the broad areas in which these inequalities of outcomes should have been addressed or should be addressed or the extent to which the government should have started addressing them in 2020: economic safety nets for the circumstances of ethnic minority people, precarious work -- who were in precarious work, self-employed in sole trading or small business.

Of course there were schemes, not for determination in this module, for self-employed and so on and so forth, and we'll have to look in due course at the extent to which the schemes that were put in place did address your concerns.

There is the link between the development of lockdown rules and their surveillance on the fact that those in ethnic minorities suffer from overcrowded, poor-quality housing, lack of access to outside and green spaces and reduced access to the internet.

Hugely important to the lockdowns; yes?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Social distancing and lockdown measures are linked to the degree of digital exclusion, because of isolation and the inability to be able to receive information about what the government has in mind for us all next.

Clinical interventions were required to be developed in partnership with ethnic minority people and trials of their effectiveness and side effects.

My Lady will be hearing a bit about that in a moment from Professor Banfield of the BMA.

For NPIs and clinical interventions there was a requirement to use the strength and cohesiveness of ethnic minority communities, that is to say to speak to them, to communicate with them, and to address how their needs and concerns could be more properly and carefully met, in the development of the intervention?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed, to work in partnership.

**Lead Inquiry**: Then lastly, in paragraph 91, you say that part of the government's obligation as at 2020 should have been -- again, I emphasise, we don't yet know the extent to which it was:

"... attention should be paid to the risk of an increase in prejudicial sentiment leading to a blaming of ethnic minority people ..."

And such racist behaviour was required to be addressed?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Indeed.

**Mr Keith**: Professor Nazroo, thank you very much.

Now, there will be some further questions for you.

**Lady Hallett**: I have the list, Mr Keith, thank you.

May I just explain to those who haven't followed this process before, before the witness gives evidence, I'm given a list of questions that core participants would like to ask. I direct which questions they may ask and I set time limits, and I'm afraid I have to be fairly strict with those time limits.

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, may I also explain that you give permission for those areas to be explored once, of course, you've heard the extent of the evidence already given, so may I invite you to give permission for the three areas that Covid Bereaved Families for Justice and Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Northern Ireland have raised within their ten-minute time allotment for Professor Nazroo?

**Lady Hallett**: Certainly.

Mr Weatherby.

Questions From Mr Weatherby KC

**Mr Weatherby**: Professor, I am going to ask you a handful of questions on behalf of bereaved families who are part of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, a significant number of whom are from ethnic minority communities.

Mr Keith's already touched on my first point. At paragraph 6 of your report, you comment on the lack of data in the ten years leading up to January 2020 relating to ethnic inequalities because of underinvestment or contributed to by underinvestment.

Is it right that the effect of the lack of such data is to reduce the ability to identify and mitigate foreseeable pre-existing ethnic inequalities?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That is correct.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Would you agree, therefore, that the underinvestment in data for the understanding and monitoring of ethnic inequalities over this period is itself, therefore, an example of structural racism?

**Professor James Nazroo**: I would argue -- I'm sorry to be kind of definitional, but I would argue that this is institutional racism within --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Okay.

**Professor James Nazroo**: -- within the process of commissioning --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Right, so you would classify it -- I don't think it probably matters, but that's very helpful -- institutional racism.

My second point, at paragraphs 26 to 33, you highlight the reported poor experiences of members of its ethnic groups with primary and secondary healthcare historically.

Are these negative experiences likely to have reduced access to healthcare when needed in the eye of the crisis?

**Professor James Nazroo**: It's hard to make that extrapolation in terms of the eye of the crisis because of the nature of the crisis --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

**Professor James Nazroo**: -- where the risk that we were all under was very obvious, but it is possible.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes, and perhaps then, for example, language difficulties, with the 111 service, it would be more difficult for accessing of that; yes?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Yes, so this is a -- language interpretation is a major issue. It affects a relatively small minority of ethnic minority people but it is absolutely crucial for them.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Okay, perhaps a wider one then is a reduced trust. Through negative experience there's a reduced trust in guidance and such matters?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Exactly. And this is, I think, something that in our conclusions we suggest should have been paid attention to.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes. Therefore, would the reported poor experiences likely have impacted on the rate of infection and, therefore, mortality in ethnic minority groups?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That's very hard to judge. It's unlikely, in my view, to have impacted on risk of infection. It may have impacted on poor outcomes and certainly may have impacted on vaccine hesitancy.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Right. That's my last point that I'm just coming on to.

So the lower satisfaction with primary and secondary healthcare services reported by ethnic minority groups, and generally the poor experience of ethnic minority women within maternal and neonatal healthcare, which was asserted in the 2018 report that you have been referred to, the PHE report, should they have raised the issue for policymakers that future engagement with ethnic minority communities may be negatively impacted?

**Professor James Nazroo**: That is my opinion.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes. That brings me on to the point of vaccine hesitancy. So was it likely to have been a factor in lowering vaccine take-up amongst ethnic minority groups?

**Professor James Nazroo**: I think prior to the pandemic we had good evidence that there would be higher levels of vaccine hesitancy amongst ethnic minority people. We had good evidence on the sources of that, which include the issues that you have raised. And we had reasonable evidence on how that might be addressed.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes, and so having had this problem highlighted in the 2018 report, at least, is there anything you're aware of that was in fact done to address this problem of engagement, particularly in relation to vaccine hesitancy, before the pandemic?

**Professor James Nazroo**: Before the pandemic, there was not.

**Mr Weatherby**: Thank you very much, Professor.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Weatherby.

Now, I don't think I'm saying goodbye, Professor, am I? I think you're returning this afternoon.

**The Witness**: I am.

**Lady Hallett**: You won't need to take the oath again.

Thank you very much.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Mr Keith**: Thank you, my Lady.

Once the Professor has gone, could we perhaps turn to another eminent professor, Professor Philip Banfield.

**Lady Hallett**: Just so people understand, the reason Professor Nazroo is coming and going is we were trying to do it in specific areas, but I don't think it's worked totally because of the availability of some witnesses.
