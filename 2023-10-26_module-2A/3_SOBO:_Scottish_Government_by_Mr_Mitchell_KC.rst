3. Submissions on Behalf of the Scottish Government by Mr Mitchell KC
=====================================================================

**Mr Mitchell**: Good afternoon, my Lady. I appear on behalf of the Scottish Government today. We have prepared a written submission, which I'm sure my Lady has seen, so I don't propose to go through that. I'm very grateful to my learned friend Mr Dawson, Counsel to the Inquiry, for his narrative.

There are a few points that I would like to comment upon. I don't take issue at all with what he says, so much I will attempt to give a slightly different perspective on what he has described.

Since late 2022, the Scottish Government has been providing both documents and statements to the Inquiry. Since July 2023, the 2A solicitors team and the Scottish Government have had fortnightly meetings at which the arrangement for delivery and identification of documents for the Inquiry has been discussed. I don't think I would be contradicted if I were to say that these meetings have been very productive and very helpful, and the result is a huge volume of material that has been provided by the Scottish Government to the Inquiry: thousands of documents; 25 corporate statements; and ultimately there will be approximately 89 or so witness statements.

The size of the task truly can't be underestimated. The Rule 9s, as my Lady knows, were extremely detailed, and the statements produced in consequence are also very detailed. This has been a real challenge for those working within government and outwith government to complete.

The detail plainly needs to be there if the Inquiry is to get through all the witnesses that it proposes within the timeframe, and of course, as a result, much evidence will have to be written and the Scottish Government completely understands that. We will continue to work together until January. The point I'm coming to is that a great deal of good work has been done and we recognise that a lot of work remains to be done. Therefore, if statements lack detail, then we will ensure that they are as full as they can be; we will provide the messages that have been asked for; we sought the Rule 21 request in order to cover the possibility that there may be sensitive personal data within that; and the issue of LPP, as my Lady knows, is in the process of being resolved.

Time is marching on, but we will do our utmost to help. The Scottish Government has placed itself at the service of the Inquiry. It has no reason whatsoever to be uncooperative or slow to respond, and I am here today to remind the Inquiry of those very facts.

Let me turn to the issue of messages, informal messaging, and Scottish Government policy in that respect.

This ought to become crystal clear when core participants see the corporate statement that has been provided by the director-general of corporate, which goes into some detail on this.

In brief, the Inquiry is seeking messages that contain decisions, messages that contain discussions around decisions, groups created on messaging platforms, dealing with matters such as logistics relating to the Covid response, and messages themselves created on these groups.

I cannot speak for other governments but, within the Scottish Government, these informal platforms are not used for decision-making. The process of making decisions, that is the way in which decisions were made, are mostly found in email exchanges. These were saved to the document management system that within Scottish Government is referred to as eRDM, electronic record document management. That was and is the culture within the Scottish Government. It is not part of the Scottish Government's culture to use informal platforms for those purposes. It does not mean that these messaging platforms were not used at all. They were used for informal communications, what might be referred as to transient messages or purposes such as, for example, alerting staff out of hours to the fact that they're required to look at an email. Should they contain important data, then the Scottish Government had a clear policy that, regardless of the format in which such data was contained, information relevant to the corporate record had to be transferred to the eRDM system.

In August of 2021 and in March 2022, directors and deputy directors within the government were reminded of the importance of ensuring material relevant to the Inquiries should be retained and stored on the corporate record.

There is of course, in what I've described, an element of personal judgement as to what falls -- as to what is important and what should be retained. But it is not difficult to understand, I would submit, why the culture of using these informal platforms for significant matters is not widespread within the Scottish Government, for they have to be moved from the informal messages onto an email and then into the corporate record. It is far easier, in the first place, to put them onto an email which automatically goes into the corporate record.

I don't think I really wish to say a great deal more, my Lady.

A good deal of work, as I said at the outset, has been done. We recognise that work remains to be done. The Scottish Government is aware, and could not fail to be aware, of the need to make rapid progress in these areas that have been described by Mr Dawson. As I said at the outset, a major reason for me coming here today was to assure you of the Scottish Government's bona fides in that respect and in respect of all matters.

My Lady has tools at disposal and she may decide that she needs to use them. Perhaps my reassurance today has -- perhaps my words today have reassured her that she may not need to use those tools, but the government will comply with everything that is required, that is asked of them.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Mitchell.

Mr Dawson, anything by way of closing?

**Mr Dawson**: No, thank you, my Lady. Other than to thank my learned friends for their submissions, there is nothing further I can usefully add.
