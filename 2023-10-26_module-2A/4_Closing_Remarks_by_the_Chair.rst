4. Closing Remarks by the Chair
===============================

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Dawson.

Over the months since this Inquiry started, I've received many words of support for the work of the Inquiry from various bodies and individuals and, as Mr Dawson has made plain, it's time for words to be put into action.

Obviously it will not surprise anyone to learn that I am very concerned about the difficulties that the Module 2A team have encountered in obtaining the material they need to ensure a thorough and rigorous analysis of key decision-making in Scotland during the worst stages of the pandemic.

I do understand the burden that we place upon material providers, both the UK Inquiry and of course the Scottish Inquiry, and that all those burdens come on top of their day job.

I don't underestimate the difficulties and I accept assurances that intentions are good but, as I've said, intentions must be put into action.

I've made plain many times that this Inquiry has a strict and ambitious timetable, and my reasons have also been made clear many times. To my mind, they are excellent reasons for that timetable, which is essentially that the public get the answers that they are seeking, they deserve, and that if possible this Inquiry can make recommendations that may reduce suffering in any future national emergency or UK-wide emergency of the kind that we suffered during the worst stages of the pandemic.

Because I am determined to stick to that strict timetable, the hearings in 2A will take place in January 2024. They will not be postponed. If I were to postpone them, then all the work in other modules of this Inquiry would be adversely impacted.

So the hearings will take place, and all those who have not yet complied with the reasonable demands of the Module 2A team should be aware that I will not hesitate to use my statutory powers, and soon, to ensure that the Module 2A team can conduct a thorough and effective analysis of the issues as they relate to Scotland, the key decision-making in Scotland.

As has been said before by others, the people of Scotland, the bereaved of Scotland expect a rigorous and effective analysis, they deserve a rigorous and effective analysis, and we will do our utmost to ensure that they get one.

With those comments, I hope that the expressions of assurance I've heard from Mr Mitchell, and of course other bodies affected by some of Mr Dawson's remarks, will be put into action.

I should also say, by way of closing, that I have of course read very carefully all the submissions that have been submitted in writing and I am grateful to all of those who have made such submissions, even if they have not obviously complemented those submissions by giving oral submissions this morning.

So I'm very grateful to everybody. I think the next hearing for this module, unless anything unexpected happens, will be in January.

**Mr Dawson**: That's right, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you all very much indeed for your attendance, both here and online, and for all the submissions that I have received. I'm very grateful. Thank you.
