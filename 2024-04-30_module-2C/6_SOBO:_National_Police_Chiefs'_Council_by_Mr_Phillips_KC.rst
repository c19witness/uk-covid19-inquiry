6. Submissions on Behalf of the National Police Chiefs' Council by Mr Phillips KC
=================================================================================

**Mr Phillips**: My Lady, as you know, I appear on behalf of

the National Police Chiefs' Council, which is a national

co-ordinating body representing all UK police forces.

The NPCC is also a core participant, again you know, in Modules 1, 2, 2A and 2B, and it's worked to assist the Inquiry at each stage of its proceedings.

In Module 2C the NPCC represents the interests of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the PSNI. The PSNI, along with police services throughout the UK, were one of the frontline services dealing with the day-to-day impacts of the pandemic on members of the public and on local communities. They undertook that work whilst of course also dealing with the impact of the pandemic on the police workforce and on normal policing activity, as well as on their own families and households.

My Lady, in Module 2 you heard evidence from Martin Hewitt, who was the chair of the NPCC throughout the pandemic. In this module, you'll hear from former Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd. Mr Todd, who retired last summer, led the policing response to the pandemic in Northern Ireland, and that was itself part of the national policing response led by the NPCC, Operation Talla.

As with the Module 2, 2A and 2B hearings, it's clear that the principal focus of these hearings will be on high level decision-making and political governance in Northern Ireland, and again, in the list of issues for this module, there is understandably very little concerning police work. The Inquiry's focus in that area seems to be once more on the question of the enforcement of the Covid regulations.

Well, my Lady, as you heard in Module 2, Operation Talla co-ordinated a far broader range of work over the course of the pandemic than just enforcing the restrictions. The many portfolios of Operation Talla here in Northern Ireland included the critical task of maintaining a workforce, providing core policing functions, supporting the criminal justice system, liaising with government, establishing procedures for the collation and analysis of Covid-19 data, procuring PPE, and delivering and training staff in its use.

As you know, my Lady, the pandemic created challenges in every aspect of public and private life. Police officers and their leaders had to adjust to novel conditions without any idea of how long they would last or how long police resources would be diminished through isolation or infection.

PSNI officers, like other police officers in the UK, did what they could to continue to discharge their usual duties and functions while paying proper regard to the safety and welfare of their own staff and officers.

However, my Lady, this is perhaps the right moment to acknowledge that, of course, policing in Northern Ireland is different, the context is different, the historical background is different. I don't want to labour the point, nor spend any time now setting out the history or the detail. I shall take it as well understood by you and by the Inquiry. That context, however, obviously added another layer of complexity to the difficult business of police work during the pandemic.

My Lady, you've heard evidence about the central importance of the NPCC's Four Es guidance for achieving compliance with the guidance: engage, explain, encourage, enforce. Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK, adopted this policing approach in March 2020, and throughout the pandemic the consistent messaging both to the public and within the PSNI was that enforcement remained the last resort, to be used only when the first three Es had been exhausted.

The task faced by the police here, as in the rest of the UK, was to encourage the public to comply with regulations which were judged by government to be in everyone's best interests and had been designed for their protection, whilst at the same time maintaining public safety and, above all, public confidence. That was a formidable assignment throughout the UK and, for the reasons I've mentioned, an even more difficult challenge here.

In Module 2, Martin Hewitt explained to you that it was compliance and not enforcement that was the true measure of success in respect of police engagement with the public and, as he noted, in a public health context it's compliance which prevents transmission and keeps the community and, indeed, the police safe.

In my closing submissions for Module 2, I made the point to you -- with, with respect, I repeat now -- that when it comes to the enforcement of the Covid regulations, the police response to the pandemic cannot fairly be assessed solely by reference to the number of fixed penalty notices issued, because that omits all the encounters which successfully achieved compliance short of that fourth E.

So it is I hope worth reminding you that the overwhelming majority of police engagements began and ended with the first three Es.

My Lady, on the question of the fourth E, enforcement, the PSNI has provided the Inquiry with the full data as to the number, the level of fines issued to members of the public during the pandemic. In Northern Ireland the PSNI were the enforcing authority for the Covid-19 regulations, but also, unlike police forces in England and Wales, were responsible for issuing the fixed penalty notices directly to members of the public.

However, recognising the importance of ensuring consistency and fairness in their approach, the PSNI added an extra layer of authorisation to the enforcement procedures for FPNs issued under the Covid regulations, and that required officers to seek approval from a silver commander in the strategic co-ordination centre before issuing an FPN.

Each FPN issued was then recorded centrally, along with the other disposal methods, such as, for example, community resolution notices.

Mr Todd analysed this data every day to ensure a consistent and fair approach. He provided summaries to government officials, to ministers and to the Chief Medical Officer to assist with their understanding of compliance and to inform decision-making.

More generally, the PSNI worked closely with the government in Northern Ireland throughout the pandemic. It was a collaborative and constructive relationship, with frank exchanges when there were, for example, concerns about the clarity and enforceability of the rules.

My Lady, I'd like, finally, to stress that throughout the pandemic the PSNI shared with the Executive the same aims, namely to prevent transmission and to keep the public safe.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Phillips.

Ms Murnaghan.
