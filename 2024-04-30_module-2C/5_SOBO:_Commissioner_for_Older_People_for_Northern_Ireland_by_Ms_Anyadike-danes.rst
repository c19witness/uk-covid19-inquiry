5. Submissions on Behalf of the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland by Ms Anyadike-danes
=======================================================================================================

**Lady Hallett**: Are you switched on? You need a green light.

**Ms Anyadike-Danes**: I am now. Thank you very much indeed, my Lady, and for giving me the opportunity to make these opening submissions.

Your Ladyship will remember that we made opening submissions right at the start of this module, and we've provided written submissions, and we have indeed provided written submissions too on this occasion. So I'm not going to repeat any of that, because I don't see how that could be helpful to your Ladyship.

The written submissions, the longer version that we did provide, dealt with some very specific concerns that the Commissioner has, including the contradiction in the government's response, the failures in communications, ageism and discrimination. And the Commissioner comes to that as Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland with an office established by the Commissioner for Older People's Act in 2011, with the principal aim of safeguarding and promoting the interests of older people in Northern Ireland, and that is a group which as at the last census in 2021 represents approximately 23% of the total population and for those purposes that is older people being aged 60 and upwards. That group is not only projected to rise but to rise at a higher rate of the overall population of Northern Ireland.

My Lady, out of those specific concerns which the Commissioner raised in his written submission, I want to just highlight a few matters without repeating what is said in those written submissions, and those are, firstly, the issue of numbers, which some have already addressed in their opening submissions; secondly, the issue of planning and decision-making, another issue featuring in others' opening submissions; and then, thirdly, making the most of the knowledge base, before going into the Commissioner's hopes for this part of the Inquiry.

So on the numbers, the Commissioner would like to highlight the disproportionate adverse impact of Covid-19 on the population of older people. It's generally accepted that the pandemic was devastating for older people, and the Minister for Health Robin Swann's acknowledgement of that is commonly cited. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on older people. 90% of Covid-19 deaths in the first wave of the pandemic were in people aged over 65, and around half of Covid-19 deaths in Northern Ireland occurred in a care home.

The fact that it is often recited doesn't stop it from being a nonetheless shocking statistic, and your Ladyship will be aware that we're dealing with those over the age of 65. If one was to take that to those over the age of 60, that of course increases. And there will be those either in this room or following the proceedings whose loved ones form a part of that awful statistic, and that also is simply a reference to the first wave, so we all know it didn't end there.

The statistics show that from 19 March 2020 to 14 October 2022, which is roughly the period covered by this module, there were 4,892 Covid-19 related deaths in Northern Ireland, and most of them were amongst older people or involved older people.

Furthermore, by 19 February 2021 alone, about a third of the way through that period, there had been 983 deaths of care home residents, and the overwhelming majority of them died in the care home itself and not in hospital.

Not only are those truly awful statistics, but they may not portray the full extent of the pandemic's impact, and this is due to the way in which the figures were collected, the criteria that applied to a Covid-19 death, coupled with the approach to testing during the pandemic, so that whether you actually knew whether you were dealing with a Covid-19 death, and the recording of deaths in care homes. The upshot of all of that is it remains still unclear how many older people died of Covid-19 during the pandemic, and it's also unclear how many older people died of conditions for which they were unable to obtain treatment due to the focus of the scarce NHS resources on dealing with the pandemic, or saw their conditions considerably worsen.

From the outset, the Commissioner advocated for accurate recording and publication of Covid-19 related deaths and he hopes that this is a matter that can be addressed during this Inquiry, because it's obvious, if you don't have accurate and relevant information, you can't plan effectively, and that's the next point that the Commissioner would like to highlight.

Planning and decision-making. Detailed information on the need for structural reform in Northern Ireland for the delivery of health and social care services was available to the government before the pandemic, and your Ladyship will be aware of the 2016 Bengoa report and COPNI itself, which is the Commissioner's office, provided three reports: one in 2014, "Changing the culture of care provision in Northern Ireland"; then another, the following year, 2015, "Prepared to Care? Modernising Adult Social Care in Northern Ireland"; and then a third in 2017, "The CMA Care Homes Market Study". So the need for reform was well known before the pandemic.

It was also well known that the reform did not take place, or at least not sufficiently, and it might be reasonable to consider that in those circumstances there should have been some level of planning about how Northern Ireland would respond to a pandemic with its structures in an as yet unreformed state. It might be reasonable to consider that the structural issues and resource deficits should have been factored into decision-making and informed the extent to which responses to the pandemic from other UK jurisdictions with different structures would be appropriate to follow in Northern Ireland, more particularly from the perspective of older people the known reliance on largely privately owned care homes contracted to the health and social care trusts to deliver social care to older people through placement packages should have informed decision-making on the pandemic, and the Commissioner is concerned that this was not reflected into critical decisions about hospital discharge, testing, vaccinating and especially in the context of lockdowns that would necessarily create a closed vulnerable community of older people.

The Commissioner is concerned about the possibility of the decision-making that impacted most adversely on older people was not just the result of poor planning and a failure to engage with the realities of the structures and resources as they existed at the time, but betrayed a degree of ageist prejudices. The type of view subsequently revealed in Sir Patrick Vallance's diaries with reference to Prime Minister Boris Johnson that "older people should be accepting their fate, and letting younger people get on with their lives during the pandemic", and that "Covid's just nature's way of dealing with old people and I'm not entirely sure I disagree with them", that sort of thinking is a real concern, the extent to which maybe not at those extreme levels but did nonetheless influence the way the policies were being formed.

The Commissioner does not believe that government properly appreciated the impact on older people and a real fear was allowed to develop amongst older people and their families that age was being used as a criterion for making those decisions rather than a clinical requirement such as a person's capacity to benefit from admission and treatment, and all of this might have been anticipated and better steps taken to address those fears, especially when the media began to report about older people being pressurised into signing "Do not attempt CPR" forms. How all of this may have translated into the high mortality and morbidity rates for older people is a matter that may well emerge in the hearing and it will be a matter for the Inquiry to determine whether there is any evidence of direct or indirect age discrimination in the government's response to the pandemic in Northern Ireland, but it is certainly a concern amongst the older people that the Commissioner represents.

Then to the making the most of the knowledge base, the final issue that the Commissioner would like to raise is the extent to which the government failed to tap into the knowledge and expertise of stakeholders to inform the development of policy and assist with the formulation of effective guidance. This was particularly regrettable in relation to older people who were known to be a vulnerable group and where there were those who could have provided constructive and informed commentary on the likely difficulties with implementation or even possible unintended consequences of the government's plans, and one example may make the point.

There are some 473 residential care homes catering for older people in Northern Ireland through about 11,400 care packages, not including those for domiciliary care which simply increase that and the significance of this service sector to the formulation and implementation of guidance to control the impact of the pandemic on older people should have been obvious to the government from the outset, yet in many instances there was an inexplicable failure to engage with it, to harness its expertise and improve the formulation of policy as well as to explain how the new regulations were intended to operate to maximise their effectiveness.

So, my Lady, just to conclude on the objectives that the Commissioner has for the Inquiry, what he hopes is for the results -- what he hopes from these oral hearings is that those sheer numbers of people who suffered or died, that there can be some proper examination and explanation of how on earth that could have happened.

He would like for everybody a clear understanding of what went wrong and why it did, and the extent to which, with better planning, something like that in the future might be avoided. He is strongly of the view that despite the experience from Exercise Cygnus to assess the UK's preparedness and response to a flu pandemic outbreak and all the modelling talent and epidemiological expertise available to the government, it failed in its most basic task, to ensure that the people would be as safe as possible from the impact of a pandemic, and a high price was paid for that failure by older people and those professionals and family who cared for them. Many older people who did not die during the pandemic nonetheless suffered considerably during lockdown and the repeated periods of isolation imposed by their care homes or the need to shield in their own homes. Residents in care homes were frequently restricted to their own room, denied the opportunity to socialise with other residents who lived under the same roof, and this lack of social contact frequently led to a deterioration in physical health and often brought about a decline in mental health, and for

some of those whose mental powers were already in

decline, the opportunity to have any appreciable contact

with someone they recognised was lost before that

contact could be reinstated, and for others who were in

the end stage of their lives the absence of their family

and friends and limited physical interaction with care

staff meant that this precious end of life period

frequently had very little quality.

The Commissioner sincerely hopes that this Inquiry,

having laid bare what happened and made recommendations

as to how to minimise the likelihood of that happening

again, that there is a positive response from government

to that. He is aware that many older people fear that

if there were to be another pandemic in the next few

years, as could happen, not enough will have changed to

ensure that there is a much better outcome for them.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed for your help.

Mr Phillips, I think you're next.
