4. Submissions on Behalf of the Trades Union Congress and Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions by Mr Jacobs
=======================================================================================================================================

**Mr Jacobs**: Good afternoon, my Lady, this is the opening statement of the Trades Union Congress (the TUC), and the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, or ICTU for short.

The TUC and ICTU are separate organisations but with shared aims and values. ICTU is the largest civil society organisation on the island of Ireland, with 44 affiliated unions north and south of the border.

The Northern Ireland Committee of ICTU is the representative body for 34 trade unions, with over 200,000 members across Northern Ireland.

I will refer in this opening submission to ICTU, but in doing so I will be referring specifically to the work of the Northern Ireland Committee.

This opening submission will highlight the unequal impact of Covid-19 in the workplace and address in outline some of the headline points as to some aspects of the government response to the pandemic which contributed to those workplace impacts.

But first the unequal impacts. It was a feature of the pandemic that many in frontline and essential roles who could not work from home were also in lower paid roles. They already suffered the structural health disadvantages associated with lower paid and insecure work. That included, of course, most visibly, many who worked in health and social care, but it also included those who kept transport systems going, who cleaned our public spaces, who worked in food processing, in manufacturing and in many other roles.

In respect of deaths from the virus in those of working age, the highest proportion in Northern Ireland, as elsewhere in the UK, was amongst process plant and machine operatives. The impact is reflected not just in the numbers of working age people who lost their lives to the virus, but also the consequences for the virus being seeded in the communities in which they lived. Deaths in the most deprived areas in Northern Ireland were significantly higher than those in the least deprived.

So we join those who, in the written evidence, have expressed a debt of gratitude for the role played by the great many, across a variety of sectors, who kept Northern Ireland going during the pandemic.

Of course, the real world impacts of a pandemic upon public services are impossible to divorce from their state going into the pandemic. The context for this module is both austerity and the absence of a properly functioning government in the years prior. The need for reform of the health and social care system had been widely recognised, but any progress towards meaningful public sector reform was stalled by the collapse of the Executive in 2017. The Inquiry has already heard evidence as to the monumental healthcare waiting lists in Northern Ireland before the pandemic even began.

Before this Inquiry Robin Swann gives a damning but accurate picture of the state of affairs going into the pandemic. He describes a period of healthcare surviving hand to mouth, resulting in short-term decisions instead of longer-term planning, and vital services being underfunded. He describes, again accurately, that social care was particularly neglected, with a lack of proper pay and career structures leaving our care homes exposed.

One means for a government to try to support the position of those at work is via social partnership. That is an approach in which the government seeks to work collaboratively with stakeholder organisations such as unions, other sectoral representative organisations and employers.

In Northern Ireland the approach to social partnership in the pandemic was mixed. ICTU's attempts to meet with the joint office holders of the First and deputy Minister often fell on deaf ears. With other ministers, such as of the Minister of and senior officials within the Department of Health, there was much positive and constructive engagement. However, piecemeal social partnership was not sufficient to address the all-encompassing nature of the pandemic.

The Executive did engage via what was called the strategic engagement forum, formed at the outset of the pandemic and which brought together employers, trade unions, and statutory bodies, including the Public Health Agency and the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland.

It first met on 30 March 2020, and had as its core purpose to advise and support the Executive in its commitment to containing the Covid-19 virus as it applied to the Northern Ireland economy and labour market.

It was effective in that it prepared a list of key workers and essential businesses, established an emergency code of practice to assist businesses in complying with Covid-19 guidance, produced workplace safety guidance and so on. The former deputy First Minister describes it as one of the success stories of the pandemic. In a sense it was. The difficulty is the impression that after that initial and early engagement, it was largely ignored.

We turn to enforcement of workplace safety.

From early in the pandemic, Northern Ireland saw concerning mass outbreaks in workplaces amidst a picture of poor safety practices. There was significant concern as to the practical ability of the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland, further to issues of capacity and resource, to monitor and enforce workplace safety. Unions called for unannounced inspections. Evidence has been provided to the Inquiry by Louis Burns, the deputy chief executive of Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland, but the picture is one of that organisation being reactive to concerns raised by others, with limited follow-up action.

Its response was limited to verbal and written communications, although it has no data system to record how many such communications were given. It is stated in terms that it would typically be for the complainant or a union rep to confirm when the advised measures had been implemented. It was, realistically, left to unions or individual complainants to both raise concerns with the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland and to follow up on whether any action had been taken.

If there really is an interest in the unequal impact of the pandemic in the workplace, there must also be an interest in workplace safety. It may be a prosaic part of the solution, but it is ultimately a fundamentally important one.

Another part of the solution is adequate financial support for those needing to self-isolate. Whilst many quite rightly benefitted from job retention schemes, many lower paid workers in higher-risk roles faced losing pay whilst needing to self-isolate. As stated by ICTU on 18 March 2020:

"The UK's ... statutory sick pay arrangements of Â£94 per week are totally insufficient and do not approach the financial reality of family life in the UK".

It was not just a matter of hardship. The lack of adequate financial support for self-isolation was a powerful disincentive to it, and will have placed an upward pressure on the spread of the virus, again particularly on communities already suffering socioeconomic and health disadvantages.

It is now evident in material obtained by this Inquiry that the Chief Medical Officer was raising the very same issue internally within government. Some analysis of the internal government machinations is within our lengthy written submission, but the picture generally is one of a lack of any determined action or even ownership of the issue.

My Lady, it is critical that in a future pandemic plans are in place to properly support those required to self-isolate.

Our final topic is the social care sector. Detailed consideration is, as you say, my Lady, for a later module, but this module will no doubt touch on the political decision-making in respect of social care.

In other modules there has been a tendency of decision-makers, in defending the history of events around discharge from hospital to social care, and the terrible death rates in care homes, to point to the role of transmission between and from staff in care homes being a relevant or even key factor.

Inevitably, many working in social care, working under the most challenging and distressing of circumstances, contracted and passed the virus. They were working in a high risk role, putting themselves and their families at risk. Of course, with a virus capable of asymptomatic transmission, staff unknowingly carrying the virus was both inevitable and foreseeable. In those circumstances, the key question is not whether staff carried the virus, but what steps were taken to address that issue in terms of effective infection prevention and control measures in the sector, practical steps to alleviate the need for workers to move between different care settings, and steps to ensure that workers were not in any way penalised by such measures.

In conclusion, my Lady, in considering and seeking to improve the effectiveness of the response to the next pandemic, there are structural problems which need to be addressed. There needs to be, quite basically, a functioning Executive, and the long called for reforms to health and social care need to be translated into action.

It is important for this Inquiry to lay bare the impact of these matters on the Covid-19 pandemic, thereby, it is hoped, prompting action. It is the heavy responsibility of the Northern Ireland Government and civil society to take these matters forward.

Building upon those foundations, pandemic preparedness and response needs to be focused on ameliorating the burden faced by those in low paid, public-facing roles who, almost inevitably in a pandemic, face higher risks of contracting the virus, against a background of poorer pre-existing health outcomes. That should include better consultation with stakeholders that bring knowledge to the government on these issues, better workplace safety contributed to by better enforcement and better support for self-isolation.

My Lady, those are my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Jacobs.

Ms Anyadike-Danes.
