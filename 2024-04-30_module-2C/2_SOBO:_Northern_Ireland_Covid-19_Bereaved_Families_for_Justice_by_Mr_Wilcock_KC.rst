2. Submissions on Behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Wilcock KC
========================================================================================================

**Mr Wilcock**: My Lady, I appear on behalf of the Northern Irish Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, together with Brenda Campbell, King's Counsel and Conal McGarrity from our instructing solicitors, PA Duffy & Co.

My Lady, you may have thought that the similarities between Northern Ireland in April 2024 and March 2020 are obvious. Now, as then, we have a fledgling Executive, formed after years of politicians using their responsibilities to run the country as a bargaining tool to further their own agenda.

Now, as then, the fledgling Executive must deal with the continuing after-effects of the resultant government inertia in terms of the damage it has done to our health and other public services and the ever-fragile political trust within our community.

And now, as then, we hope that this part of the world can put its troubled past behind it and be run like a modern 21st century European country where the government always and universally realises that its first responsibility in a democratic society is to protect, safeguard the lives of its citizens.

Did the decision-making by the government in Northern Ireland in response to the Covid pandemic from early 2020 always meet this fundamental objective? Sadly, we suggest the Inquiry may very well feel that it did not.

Time does not permit me to exhaustively list the many examples of this failure that the Inquiry will hear about over the next 12 days, so at this stage can I confine myself to dealing with four topics.

Topic 1, was Northern Ireland's contingency planning fit for purpose in January 2020? Well, not according to an internal email sent by a Bernie Rooney, a senior civil servant in the Executive Office, or TEO, as I shall subsequently refer to it. Her assessment was that work on the Civil Contingencies Policy Branch in Northern Ireland, otherwise known as CCPB(NI), had been, and I quote, "put on hold" due to post Brexit EU planning and that:

"The overall position is dire, There has been systemic failure to invest funding and resources in CCPB(NI) over a number of years and the current position is that at a time of focus, the lack of investment I regret to have to advise you has left it not fit for purpose ..."

My Lady, a well known footballer from this island is fond of saying "Fail to prepare, prepare to fail" and you will have to decide whether that is precisely what happened when it came to pre-Covid contingency planning in Northern Ireland.

Topic 2, why was there no forceful and immediate emergency response, as we've just heard, by the administrative and political decision-making bodies in Northern Ireland until late March 2020? The 2021 report from the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response established by the World Health Organisation described February 2020 as a "lost month", when steps could and should have been taken to curtail the pandemic.

They noted that their declaration of a public health emergency of international concern as early as 30 January 2020 was the loudest alarm the World Health Organisation could sound, and should have put governments around the world on notice that such a "forceful and immediate response" was required, given the "mounting evidence that a highly contagious new pathogen was spreading around the world".

Why was it that Northern Ireland joined the list of countries who failed to heed this warning and take advantage of the delayed arrival of Covid into the island of Ireland and the fact that the first positive test here was one month after the rest of the UK?

My Lady, you will hear detailed evidence about the Civil Service and political arrangements that have evolved in Northern Ireland since the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement of 1998. For present purposes, it suffices to say that you will hear evidence about administrative tensions between the Ministry of Health, which was the initial lead department in relation to the initial Covid response, and the Executive Office as the department best placed to co-ordinate the cross-cutting measures across the government departments you may think a response to the pandemic inevitably required.

My Lady, we anticipate that you will hear evidence that although there was a recognition by the Department of Health as early as 6 February 2020 that the framework to co-ordinate and manage emergency responses within Northern Ireland, known as NICCMA, would need to be activated at least when Covid arrived in Northern Ireland. When this happened on 27 February, there followed a number of potential missed opportunities, by both the Department of Health and the Executive Office, to make any meaningful effort to stand up with a civil contingency response to the pandemic until the weekend of 14 March 2020.

My Lady, you will forgive me if I say no more about this, given the time presently available and the helpful chronology my learned friend Ms Dobbin has already given you about these issues.

Topic 3, political dysfunction.

My Lady, on 17 March 2020, Northern Ireland's hugely experienced Chief Medical Officer sent a text message to the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, reading:

"It was deeply frustrating that some, including some of our politicians, really haven't been getting this."

Now, my Lady, we do not say that any individual from whom or about whom you will hear evidence never did their best to act in the public interest in what we all recognise were extremely challenging times for everyone involved, and Northern Ireland is in many ways a prisoner of its past and huge efforts have been made in many quarters in many years to escape that legacy. Unfortunately you will have to decide whether, even in the midst of the deadliest and longest public health emergency in living memory, some -- not all -- of our politicians behaved in ways which were inevitably and unnecessarily divisive and at times lost sight of the fact that a united response to combat a virus which affected everyone equally, no matter what their background or what their views on the national question, was required.

My Lady, this is not a criticism of any individual person, political party or community. Sadly, it applies to a number of people who should have known better, from a number of political parties, and to representatives of both communities. You will have to consider whether this criticism could be applied to the insistence that the difficult and vexed question of whether to shut schools in March 2020 could be decided not on the grounds of science, not on the grounds of the admittedly difficult question of the balance of undeniably complex competing interests, but by the simple question of whether we should follow London or Dublin, or whether British scientific advice was inevitably preferable to Irish scientific advice or vice versa.

My Lady, we say that there were many examples of political dysfunction in the political response to the pandemic. In this context, you will hear evidence of outrageous and scientifically baseless assertions by senior politicians, senior ministers that there was a meaningful difference in transmission between Nationalist and Unionist areas.

We suggest that the nadir of this dysfunction came during the meetings you've heard about, the acrimonious and late night meetings of the Executive between 9 and 12 of ... 2020 when the Democratic Unionist Party thought it appropriate to insist on a cross-community vote on public health measures, which affected every community equally.

So they could effectively exercise a veto over the continuation of coronavirus restrictions, supported, as Ms Dobbin has just observed, by the Northern Ireland CMO and other political parties from all communities, including the Ulster Unionist Minister of Health.

My Lady, this action created the clear impression amongst many of those that I represent, and not for the first time or exclusively by the biggest Unionist party, that even with eight months' experience of the terrible dangers of Covid, party politics mattered more to some senior politicians than following the science. And as if to demonstrate the DUP were not alone, the following month the deputy First Minister seemingly refused to sign off a four nations joint statement in advance of Christmas 2020, in what looked to some like a fit of pique after a proposal by her party to implement travel restrictions from GB, where a new variant was in circulation, failed.

Now, my Lady, there is no doubt that these times were stressful for everyone involved, and that may well be why, in the autumn of 2020, Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer, Dr McBride, used uncharacteristically coarse language in exchanges with the Minister of Health when he wrote:

"Dysfunctional bastards. How will we ever get through this with an enemy within? I have a good mind to walk off and leave them to it, as no doubt do you. But then those that really matter, those whom they seem to have forgotten they represent, are really depending on us."

Now, my Lady, whilst this stress or frustration may explain the choice of language, it does not explain away the sentiment. Dr McBride, in the forensically revealing text messages we've seen, had been using the word "dysfunctional" about members of the Executive since at least May 2020, and you heard a flavour of some of the quotes this morning.

You may think it may have been used on many occasions appropriately thereafter, including the hurtful and premeditated decision of senior Sinn FÃ©in members of the Executive to attend a large-scale funeral gathering at a time when people across Northern Ireland were being denied that basic and emotive right by executive decisions they had been at the heart of making.

But, my Lady, this decision was more than just distressing to those who lost loved ones or were unable to do the same during this pandemic. It was also a decision by those who attended Mr Storey's funeral to prioritise their friendships or leadership roles within their political tradition at the expense of their leadership roles in relation to a large-scale public health emergency affecting all political traditions and affecting the whole community.

An immediate consequence of these events was the cessation of joint press conferences between the First and deputy Ministers. Another was the very predictable breakdown of trust that was going to become increasingly necessary the longer the public was to be asked to observe restrictions on their behaviour as part of public health measures, and which, although we will listen to the results of the investigations ordered by this Inquiry with interest, frankly still permeates the sorry revelations that we've just heard about that not all potential evidence of informal communications was retained by important participants in these events, as it should have been.

My Lady, in November 2020 the Chief Medical Officer sent a message to the Chief Scientific Officer, reading:

"Disgraceful. They should hang their heads in shame. How will history tell this story to the wife and two boys of a 49-year old who said goodbye to their father on Facebook as he lay in the ICU for the sake of two weeks' more effort?"

We suggest that although this message was written in the context of the political impasse in November 2020 leading to the use of the cross-community vote, it could have been used at any one of a number of occasions of the political dysfunction you will hear about thereafter.

We suggest that, when you look at it in the round, it applied at times to both of the biggest parties, and that that failure to learn from past mistakes as the second wave hit in 2021 was all the more unforgivable, given what you've heard this morning about the disproportionate impact that the second wave in 2021 had on Northern Ireland.

Dr McBride's words also highlight that at the heart of all this decision-making you will be considering in this module lie very human stories of love and loss. The Inquiry may conclude that there were a number of serious adverse consequences to the way Northern Ireland's government response to Covid developed, including the fact that not only was appropriate action which might have saved life not taken early enough, but also that repeated delays led to longer lockdowns and ensured that their associated detrimental effects were intensified.

We have set out in our written submissions the various ways in which many members of the organisation I represent are concerned that, in the perhaps inevitable confusion that followed the spread of the pandemic and the delayed government response, their relatives, including people in care homes, older people and the disabled, were, they feel, effectively given up on.

My Lady, not least because of the powerful and courageous accounts captured in the impact video we saw earlier this morning, you know only too well that every single one of those relatives mattered, every single one was mourned, and every single one continues to be missed.

As Ms Dobbin told you earlier, you will hear this afternoon from Marion Reynolds, who mourns the death of her aunt, Marie Reynolds, who contracted Covid during a hospital admission after being discharged back to a care home with a package that did not meet her needs as an older person who was also deaf and who relied heavily on human contact.

There are far, far too many experiences for me to ever list adequately. There are examples I would like you to listen to of Agnes McCusker(?), believing that her mother, Bridget Halligan, went downhill after visits to her care home were stopped on 18 March. Her family had visited her every day up until this point. Bridget had tested positive for Covid on around 7 April 2020, and passed away, like so many others, alone on 12 April 2020.

Cousins Christine Tomlinson(?) and Ingrid Johnson(?), who each lost their fathers, James Gallagher(?) and Robert Gallagher(?), two brothers who, in June 2020, caught Covid in the care home in which they resided. Both Ms Tomlinson and Ms Johnson share concerns about the spread of Covid in care homes, about medications prescribed, about feelings that their fathers were given up on, about a lack of access to information about their fathers and about their rights as carers and about denials of funeral rights.

Members of the organisation I represent, my Lady, have listened to your assurance that, whether it be in this module or by the end of the process of this Inquiry, you will do your best to deal with all of those issues. But as far as this module is concerned, can I echo the words of Catriona Myles in her evidence for Module 2 in London, that she and so many others hope that today you will remember every mother, father, brother, sister, husband, wife, all who have suffered and lost. Ultimately they are now telling their loved ones' stories because those who died are not here to tell it and those left behind want to know why.

Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice believe that considered as a whole, the combined responses of the Northern Ireland and UK Government in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic failed to protect the most vulnerable in society, with a lack of preparedness and delayed response, leading to last minute decision-making, exacerbated by unnecessary party infighting which contributed to a greater loss of life than was necessary, in circumstances which have caused lasting trauma to many, many people in our society.

We urge the Inquiry to fearlessly investigate these issues, as we know you will, establish the truth of what occurred and to make recommendations which ensure, as far as possible, that any failings identified are never, ever repeated again.

My Lady, I could say more, but I have a limited amount of time, and I think I've now used it up.

**Lady Hallett**: How much longer do you want to go on for?

**Mr Wilcock**: No, I'll stop while the going's good.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, that's very helpful.

Right, we shall return at 1.45, please.

*(12.50 pm)*

*(The short adjournment)*

*(1.45 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Right, Mr Friedman.
