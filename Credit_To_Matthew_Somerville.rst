**Comments here below pertinent to** `ukcovid19inquiry.dracos.co.uk <https://ukcovid19inquiry.dracos.co.uk>`_ **on which THIS site is based**. These are also Matthew's own words:

"This site takes a copy of the `official transcripts <https://www.covid19.public-inquiry.uk/hearings>`_, which are available in PDF,
parses them into reStructuredText, and uploads them to ReadTheDocs for
**display and searching**. It also auto-links evidence IDs to the relevant page on the official site.

I hope this may be useful to people following the Inquiry.
If you have any questions or comments, please do get in touch.

P.S. Twenty years ago, I made a nicer version of the Hutton Inquiry website
(which was using frames and required cookies and JavaScript). The official
domain is sadly now a personal injury spam site (it is available from the
`National Archive
<https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20090128221550/http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/>`_),
but mine is still running in the same place at `hutton.dracos.co.uk
<http://hutton.dracos.co.uk/>`_!"
