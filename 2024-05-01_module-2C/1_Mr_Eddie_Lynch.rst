Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Ms Treanor**: Good morning, Commissioner. Thank you for attending today and for your assistance to the Inquiry. At the outset, could I just remind you to try to speak slowly and speak into the microphone so that our stenographer can hear you for the transcript.

You have provided Module 2C with one witness statement which we have at INQ000267978. You can now see that on the screen. If we turn to page 42, we can see that you signed that statement on 6 September 2023. Are the contents of that statement true to the best of your knowledge and belief?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yes, they are.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Mr Lynch, since June 2016, you have been the Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland. Prior to that, you were the chief executive of Age Sector Platform, a charity representing the interests of older people; is that right?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: That's correct, yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And the Commissioner for Older People is an independent statutory role established by the Commissioner for Older People Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 and the principal aim of your role is to safeguard the interests of older people in Northern Ireland, and as Commissioner you have a number of mandatory statutory duties and powers. Could you provide us with a brief overview of your general powers and duties in illustrating what your role looks like in practice?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yes, of course. As Commissioner, my principal aim is to safeguard and promote the interests of older people in Northern Ireland and part of this role, one of my roles is to advise government on older people's issues, to commission research into issues that I feel are of importance, make recommendations to government on issues that affect older people here and I've also legal powers in relation to investigations that I can conduct, formal and informal investigations, as well.

And I suppose part of my role is to constantly review the services that older people receive, and to influence policy, practice and legislation that affect the needs of older people in Northern Ireland.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

In the legislation, the primary definition of "older person" is a person aged 60 or over, and in your statement you have indicated that as of March 2021, Northern Ireland had an over 60s population of just under 440,000, or about 23% of our total population. Is that right?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: That's correct, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Clearly that's a very large constituency and will capture a broad range of experiences and personal circumstances. In a few sentences, can you give us a brief overview of the characteristics of that older population in Northern Ireland?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Well, it's a very diverse population. Over 60 is a large category in terms of 60 to 100, there's obviously many different issues for people of different ages. We're living in an ageing population, which is a good news story, and people are living longer, healthier lives, but there's clearly a lot of issues that affect older people in that age group as well, particularly when you get into the 70s and 80s plus group, a lot of issues around health and social care, a lot of major challenges in Northern Ireland in terms of meeting the needs of that ageing population.

So whilst there are lots of positives with ageing population and what it can provide to society, there are a lot of challenges that come with it that government needs to really address, and I think a lot of the issues that came up in the pandemic were reflective of some of the failings there have been in those issues.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, let's turn then to look at your role during the pandemic. During that time, how did you go about gathering information as to the impact of the pandemic on older people?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: It came in various ways, you know, as an independent body we rely very much heavily on what people bring to us, so we will have heard -- we would have had a lot of older people themselves coming to us with concerns, particularly as the pandemic approached, we would have a lot of families with concerns in relation to care homes and domiciliary care packages and things like that, but we'd also have had a lot of organisations that would have come to us as well and would express any concerns. So for example on the care home side of things, the independent healthcare providers would have been in contact with my office on numerous occasions in those early stages of the pandemic and they would have been reflecting issues that they were hearing on the ground in relation of the preparedness of that sector to -- for Covid.

So really my office, we also would have reached out to any people with expertise, you know, none of us are trained professionals in epidemiology or virology, so we would quite often have reached out to experts in those fields as well, as well as taking in the media, because obviously there was a lot of media coverage at the time about Covid and it was a steep learning curve for us all, but our aim was to try to provide as strong a role as possible to ensure that older people were protected as best they could be.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In addition to that, you also participated in weekly four nations meetings of the UK network of older people's organisations. Very briefly, was that an effective forum for information sharing and to what extent did that inform your work?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: It was very effective, it came together organically, I suppose, it was an informal meeting with myself, the Welsh Commissioner for Older People and many of the other older people's organisations across the UK, and it was a very useful forum for sharing what was happening. This was new to everybody, the pandemic was something we hadn't experienced before. The challenges it brought were new for a lot of us, and it was very useful to compare and contrast the different approaches being taken by different governments in different regions of the UK.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of the impact, then, of Covid-19 on older people, you've said in your statement that statistics and lived experience would suggest that your constituents are uniquely vulnerable to experiencing long-term physical or mental health conditions, loneliness and to feel more significant physical impacts of being required to shield. Is that a fair summary?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yes, it is, yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we could have on screen, please, I think INQ000237823.

Now, Commissioner, this graphic is an extract from a survey that your office commissioned in September 2023 entitled "Impact of [Covid-19] on Older People", and I'd just like to highlight a few of the key findings.

So 32% of respondents experienced increased loneliness, 20% found it quite or very difficult getting shopping or other household necessities during Covid and lockdown, 25% find it harder than previously to access medical services such as GP surgeries.

Now, the Inquiry knows there were various initiatives progressed to try to mitigate some of those impacts. Very briefly, what is your view of the efficacy of those mitigations? Was this something about which you were receiving any feedback from older people and their families?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yes. I mean, clearly the impact of lockdown was really significant in older people for many different reasons. It affected everyone in society, but for older people it affected them a lot more severely. More older people were -- would be living alone than others in society. They were also living with the fear of Covid; they were very aware through the media that they were in the group most vulnerable, and at risk.

There were a lot of very good community initiatives that were set up in the early stages. There was a really good response around from the community and charity sectors about trying to assist older people, you know, with their shopping, making sure that they were calling in on them, making sure they were okay. But clearly there was still, you know, much higher levels of fear and loneliness caused by Covid.

I think the other major issue was, you know, a lot of older people still had not accessed the internet and that closed them off from the world a lot more than many other groups, and I think that made it even more distressing for them, and I think that contributed to higher levels of anxiety, fear and depression.

So that -- they were all factors.

It was an extremely difficult time, and I think as well as we talk about, you know, the hospitals and the care homes, it is really important to reflect on how lockdown affected people in the community as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You've just touched on the issue in care homes.

Perhaps we can take the document down now, thank you.

You explain in your statement that, at the outset of the pandemic, your office began to receive a large volume of complaints from older people, care providers and families on a range of concerns, and one of the first issues to emerge, it appears, was the discharge of patients from hospitals into care homes. You explain in your statement that this was being raised with you on two fronts, firstly by care home providers who reported feeling under pressure to accept new residents into their homes in the absence of adequate testing, and secondly by the families of people residing in care homes.

What were the concerns being identified to you about discharge into care homes and testing at that time, at the outset?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yeah, this was a very serious concern, as you say, raised by both families and providers, and I think -- you know, this was the early stages where there was a lot of awareness about the vulnerability of people living in care home settings and how vulnerable they would be if Covid got into care home settings, given how quickly it could spread and how much at risk those people would be.

It did come to my attention several times about the hospitals being cleared out, as it was, to make space for a possible surge of Covid patients, and part of that seemed to be discharging people into care homes where they could.

I was very concerned, and so were the care home providers, that those people were put into those settings without testing. It was very clear and obvious at that stage -- whilst there were lots of things in this pandemic that were very new and, you know, would have taken hindsight, I don't think it was -- I think it was very clear cut that the policy of discharging people without testing into those settings was a potentially disastrous one. I think it was quite reckless a decision to take to allow that to happen. I think the reports that I was getting from the care home providers themselves showed that, because they were very much aware of the risks that this policy could have on their residents.

And I think that is something that is a learning from this, that this Inquiry would look at, to see, you know, if this was to happen again, clearly decisions like this need to be thought through and the consequences of making those decisions need to be thought through, and I'm sure that that policy alone contributed to a lot of negative outcomes in homes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Now, we'll return in just a moment to talk about your engagement with government on these issues, but in terms of the issues being raised at the outset, was the issue of restrictions on visiting also raised with you, and if so, what were you hearing about the impact of that on older people?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yes, at the start the issue of visiting, it was very clear that the best chance to protect life in care homes was to reduce the amount of people, the amount of footfall into care home settings, and the authorities were pretty unanimous in saying that to try to protect the residents and try to reduce the number of infections, that they would have to suspend all visiting. I thought that was probably the only decision that could be taken at the time, given that we, you know, had no vaccine, we had already saw across Europe the impact that Covid could have when it got into a care home setting. So that decision was really borne out of a desire to protect life.

I think when you look back and then the learning, as the pandemic went into a number of months, it was clear that there was negative impacts with that as well, that the impact of no social contact between residents and their families had a very detrimental effect on both, and I think one of the -- you know, that lasted for a long period of time. We were aware of many cases that came to us that were really distressing cases where families were desperate to get in to see their loved ones, that they could see their loved ones deteriorating, and they couldn't do anything about it or they couldn't be there to comfort them and that was deeply distressing. And I think I would think that one of the things that I would like to see come out of this Inquiry would be how that sort of situation could be managed better in future, because whilst we had to have the ring of steel around homes and try to keep out infections, and I think initially that was the right decision, I do think, you know, we saw the devastating impact on the residents, many of whom lived their last months of their lives without that family and social contact.

**Lady Hallett**: Have you had any thoughts -- by the sounds of it you think a lot about this subject, Mr Lynch -- about how you can -- so on the one hand you're protecting physical life, as it were, as opposed to death, but on the other hand you've got the mental issues of both -- as you say, on the residents and the family. I mean, do you draw a distinction between when a resident has got Covid? I mean, have you thought about how you might change the rules for the future, what guidance might be given in the future?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: I think if -- I think this comes down to preparedness for the pandemic as well, and it was new, we weren't experienced in any way of dealing with this. There was steps that were taken by government, for example, making some money available to care homes so we talked about the ability for care homes to create visiting pods and spaces and safer spaces, I think in the future that would be something that you'd want to see expanded. I think now that we've been through this experience, I think looking back on that, you need to be thinking: well, if this was to happen again, here's several ways that we could bring in some level of contact with families. You know, I think the situation was taken for the right reasons in terms of suspending visiting, but there's no doubt the consequence of that was devastating for many people.

So I think -- you know, having been through it, I think there are ways that contact could be increased. There are, you know, with the right infection control measures in place, there were things that came in later on in the pandemic that worked quite well, but I think one of the things that I would say is, whilst, you know, there were many people, my office was getting a very mixed response from families in relation to this, you know, whilst many people wanted changes and lifting of visiting restrictions there was an equally large number of people who wanted them kept in place and wanted the ring of steel, if you like, kept for longer. But I think it's very clear now as we look at the evidence that it's not hard to visualise the impact that had on so many residents, many of whom wouldn't have had capacity to know what was going on, and I think that was what was so distressing for both them and their families.

So I think -- I don't have all the answers, but I think there are certain things that could be done in those settings that would allow care home providers and government to work more quickly in a future situation.

The other thing that I would say is I think that the care home providers themselves should have been engaged with at a higher level than they were. I think there was guidance produced, we -- myself and my team -- we had sight of that only a day before it was published. I know the providers would have liked a lot more opportunity to influence that guidance, so when it was introduced, it was more effective.

So I think there are -- there are things that could work, that could happen now, parts of work that actually could foresee a future pandemic and could think outside the box about the different ways and different methods that we could keep some sort of human -- human response.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Ms Treanor**: Commissioner, just picking up on what you've just been talking about, it's clear from your statement that the families of older people are a particularly important part of your network. They are very often, you say, the first to raise an issue; they are perhaps your eyes and ears. Recognising the importance of families as a source of intelligence for you, how did restrictions on visiting impact your ability to perform your function as Commissioner during the pandemic?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Well, you know, as you say, the families are the eyes and ears on the ground and, you know, in our social care system, particularly within care home settings, we have, you know, the RQIA who do the inspections and ensure standards are being met, but I actually think there's nothing that beats the families on the ground being in there on a regular basis to ensure everything is well.

I think it was one of the unfortunate consequences of the restrictions that that oversight of care within homes was certainly reduced, and that was an added fear for family members in that situation.

Again, looking back, would it still have been better to have a degree of inspections going in? That may have been the case. Again, it's weighing up the risk. But I think it did raise major concerns that there wasn't that scrutiny and oversight at the time. My office was conscious of that. What we did a lot with was we were working with the care home providers as an organisation, we wanted to be as supportive as possible, we wanted the care homes to get as much support as they could get, because I think one of the things we were very conscious about at that time was the response to the pandemic was adding costs to care homes. You know, just by the extra, you know, the extra work they had to do, the infection control, they were under major pressure in terms of staffing as well, you know; a lot of care workers got Covid themselves. So the conditions that they were working in were very -- extremely difficult and I think again that's where, you know, I think they would have -- it would be better for them to get a higher level of support in any future to ensure that they could do their jobs as best as possible and keep people safe.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I'll just move on then to look at your engagement with government throughout the pandemic. In your statement you describe various difficulties in terms of your ability to engage meaningfully with government throughout the pandemic, and if I may summarise your evidence like this: you refer to the absence of a designated single point of contact within the Department of Health, which you say curtailed your ability to get in touch with the right people. You describe occasions where you felt you had no choice but to have recourse to the media in order to present your concerns. You explain how at times, and I think you've just touched on this, guidance was circulated to your office at such late notice as to really preclude meaningful consideration and response. And you also suggest that there was no proper forum for you to present your concerns in a constructive way.

Now, in your statement you referred to having established trusted lines of communication with, amongst others, the Chief Social Work Officer and the Director of Mental Health, Disability and Older People within the Department of Health, and you say that those pre-dated the pandemic and you relied on those during the pandemic. Is that right?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yes, that's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Picking up on the point about the absence of a single point of contact, is it not the case that the Chief Social Work Officer and the Director of Mental Health, Disability and Older People were the appropriate points of contact for you during the pandemic?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: There was a lot of issues coming to my office at the time and the Health Department is a big department and a lot of the issues I remember we weren't sure ourselves who were the right people to speak to in the health service, so whilst it's true to say that we had fairly regular meetings with some key officials, the speed and frantic nature of the pandemic meant issues were coming up on a daily basis, on an hourly basis at times, and there was times when we felt that we needed an urgent answer to things, and there were certainly times where we felt frustrated that we couldn't get speaking to the right person or took some time to get responses to things.

So there was a sense, I think, that whilst we did have, you know, several meetings and contacts, because of the nature of what we were dealing with, we felt sometimes frustrated that we couldn't get the answers that we wanted, and I certainly felt at times it took a while before we could get answers to certain questions.

Also some of the concerns that I was raising of course I didn't get the answers that I wanted or I wasn't assured that maybe enough work was going on in certain areas. So that sort of fed into that sort of sense of: could the communication between myself and my team and the department have been streamlined and improved?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, perhaps let's look at an example which might demonstrate your point.

If we can have up on screen, please, INQ000267978.

Now, this is your statement. At paragraph 68 you are referring to a meeting that you were invited to by the Chief Medical Officer on 16 March 2020, and the purpose of that meeting was to discuss guidance which was forthcoming for care homes. I'll just read what you've said about that. You say:

"The officials were unable to address many of the issues [the Commissioner] raised ..."

I will pause here. Your chief executive attended this meeting in your stead, it wasn't you; is that correct?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: That's correct, I was meeting the minister at the time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: "... and it soon became clear that that some of these issues had simply not been considered before, nor had sufficient thought been given to the practical outworking of the guidance. Importantly, the lack of consultation with the sector was raised. I, and indeed my team, regarded the draft guidance as unrealistic and impractical. In our view it required consultation. More significantly, COPNI was informed that there was simply not enough time to address the points being made as the guidance had to be issued the next day, which was St Patrick's Day. My Chief Executive reported orally to me after that meeting that despite her drawing attention to the high numbers of elderly in Italy who were contracting and dying of Covid-19, there was an 'air of unreality'. The view expressed by PHA seemed to be 'that won't happen here, they have a completely different system over there'."

Pausing here, may I ask you this: might that suggest that, due to a lack of preparedness on those issues, there was perhaps a failure to appreciate what actions may be required in the event of a pandemic?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Absolutely. This guidance had been developed really quickly, literally within days, but, as you say, this was the middle of March at this stage. At this stage we had known for several weeks that the pandemic was going -- was coming, and we certainly had a lot of concerns with regard to the care home sector given that we had the advantage of seeing what had happened in other countries, as it came towards Northern Ireland. We were very frustrated that we didn't have more time to engage with the department on that guidance. Rather than issuing it the next day, I think the focus should have been on getting that guidance as good -- make it as good as possible, rather than just getting it out.

We had met with the -- my chief executive had met with independent healthcare providers on it, they had raised significant concerns about it, they felt that the guidance was actually going to be very confusing for care home operators, but also in many ways totally unrealistic. There was also a fear that if they couldn't meet the guidance what would happen to them as well. So this is a good example of something that I felt should have been done much earlier, it should have been in place; in proper planning for a pandemic situation, we should have had guidance like this sitting there ready to go. But even in the absence of that I think there would have been sufficient time through January and February to have worked on that guidance, worked with the key -- the key stakeholders which, in this case, would have been the care home providers, and actually develop something that was very much more workable on the ground, and then -- and therefore more effective in managing care in this challenging situation.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You've just reiterated there your point that you thought the guidance was unrealistic and impractical. Very briefly, why did you think that?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: It was -- it was putting a lot of extra responsibilities on the care homes without proper consultation with them. So we weren't experts in running care homes, but the providers were, so there was a lot of things in the guidance that they just felt was impractical, that was harder to deliver, certainly hard to deliver, you know, overnight practically. Clearly there was, there were big challenges that they were facing at this time, that they were very keen to get into discussion on, one of the big issues that they were raising was again the ongoing lack of PPE equipment that they were facing. They had raised concerns at this time around testing as well. So there was a lot of things being put on to them but they actually felt there were some really big issues that weren't being addressed, and there really was a willingness on the care home side to really engage on these issues, they wanted to work with government to ensure that they could do their job as best they could.

This was a very worrying time, not least, you know, they had concerns around their own staff, their own workforce, you know, the implications of staff leaving or staff getting sick with Covid and their ability to manage this. So I think the approach should have been a lot more iterative, really, and really there should have been a more of a partnership approach to this, and I think more of a partnership approach to getting care right would have actually been much more effective on the ground and would introduce new practices a lot more quickly than they actually ended up being.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just picking up on that point about the need for consultation and engagement, do you suggest it would have been appropriate for the department to have delayed the issue of that guidance to facilitate further consultation and engagement, or do you not consider that --

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yes, I do. I don't think the guidance when it was introduced was effective. I think it needed -- it needed a lot of work after that to actually put into place and practice good practices. So whilst I would have preferred if that engagement process had happened much sooner, you know, maybe through February, I think it would have been -- we would have ended up with a lot more strong guidance if there had been allowed, you know, an extra week, for instance, to go through what care homes were required to do and how -- more importantly, how it was going to be done, because guidance is fine on paper, but if it can't be put into practice, then it's not much use.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Okay.

One of the issues this module is examining is the absence of power-sharing immediately prior to the pandemic in terms of the response to the pandemic thereafter. In your statement, you suggest that weaknesses in the social care system were evident from a number of previous reports prepared both by your office and indeed the Bengoa report, and you say this:

"Therefore, when the transmission rate of Covid-19 started to rise markedly and a government response was required, those weaknesses in the structure for delivering adult social care ... and their implications should have been appreciated and factored into planning to avoid potentially disastrous outcomes for older people."

Firstly, can it be taken from your evidence there that those pre-existing weaknesses hadn't been addressed in the interim and were in fact still very much present at the outset of the pandemic in 2020?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yes, absolutely, they were horribly exposed and I think, as you say, my office had been calling for several years about major changes that were needed to fix the system, and I think the absence of government over that time and -- didn't allow progress to be made against the recommendations that came out of several reports advising the change that was needed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And without diverting into the substance of previous reports and their recommendations, to what extent do you consider that those weaknesses had been appreciated and factored into planning and decision-making by the department during the pandemic?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: I'm not sure, I mean, I think the pandemic was such a shock, I think there was very much a reactive response from the department to planning and protecting people. I think one of the most striking features of the early months of the pandemic was the difference in how the NHS was viewed and how the social care sector was viewed. I mean, Northern Ireland's often put up as different from the rest of the UK, that it has an integrated health and social care system, but I think what the pandemic showed was just the dividing line between the two, and the approach taken by the department, there was clearly a focus on protecting the NHS, the concern was clearly about hospital capacity, but as a result of that we saw a lot of the care home and social care sector really struggle, and I had many care home providers, both care home providers and domiciliary care providers, coming to my office a lot in those early weeks saying that in their words they felt high and dry, that they were being left to fend for themselves, not least the issues around PPE where they felt they weren't getting the support, despite reassures that the trust, the health trust should have been providing that. On the ground, that clearly wasn't happening and it did take several weeks to sort that issue out.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You've touched there on the issue of the integrated health and social care system that we have here in Northern Ireland, which is distinct. Can you give us your views as to whether there may have been any untapped advantages inherent in that system which could have been exploited during the pandemic, and if you do think that that's the case, your views on the extent to which those were sufficiently capitalised upon by decision-makers?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: I think there was a lot of things that could have been done better. I think the fact that, for a start, Northern Ireland's not a very big place, the fact we had an integrated health and social care sector, that there was those relationships in place, that people knew, there was definitely clear relationships and clear contact, I don't think those contacts were maximised in the way they could have been. I think there was a lot of expertise out there, not just in the care home sector, but across different fields, you know, academics, you know, experts in the transmission of diseases like this, and I don't think a lot of that was tapped into in the response from government. There was a lot of guidance developed, but, as we've talked about already, a lot of the times that guidance when it hit the ground didn't actually deliver effective results and it needed to be revised several times, and I think that was something that was a theme of the early stages, that there could have been a lot more bringing together of expertise and producing more effective responses.

**Ms Treanor**: Thank you, Commissioner.

My Lady, I have no further questions. You have already granted permission for a number.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

Ms Campbell.

Questions From Ms Campbell KC

**Ms Campbell**: Thank you, my Lady, and thank you, Mr Lynch. My name is Brenda Campbell and I represent the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved.

It has been touched upon briefly in your evidence already, and you stated -- I think it's paragraph 31 of your statement, if we want to bring it up -- that there are a series of historic COPNI reports that in fact pre-date your tenure as Commissioner that have highlighted serious and long-standing concerns about the provision of care to older people in our society and also identify recommendations for reform. I want to look at one of them.

I don't require it to be put up on screen, but it's the 2015 document that I'm sure you're familiar with about "Prepared to care? Modernising Adult Social Care in Northern Ireland". You exhibit it in your statement. That review identifies the following: that legislation and policy guidance surrounding adult social care is, in the North, outdated, confusing and fragmented, and that it need to be fully updated to reflect and meet the needs of our modern society.

Now, you're nodding your head. That was the situation in 2015. Is it still the situation today?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: There have been, I mean, I think there -- the lack of progress has been frustrating for me in terms of adult social care. There are things that are happening now in terms of reform of adult social care but, as you say, this is nine years on from that report. There have been some steps taken. For instance, there's an Adult Protection Bill that is close to being finalised that hopefully will be going through the Assembly and that's around adult safeguarding legislation. Hopefully that will be coming into law within the -- in the foreseeable future.

But I have been, through my eight years as Commissioner, frustrated with how slow the process has been to address the very clear issues in adult social care and it has been exposed several times. As you know, as you mentioned, there's been a number of reports. My investigation into Dunmurry Manor in my "Home Truths" report outlined over 50 recommendations for change as well, some of which are happening. But, again, the pace of change is slow and, in an ageing population, one of the things that I have been saying consistently is: these issues are issues now, but with an ageing population these issues are only going to become more serious if more action is not taken and more focus is not taken on these areas, and we can't afford -- I think what the pandemic showed, we can't afford to sit on these issues any longer, we need actions and real change to be brought into play to best protect some of the most vulnerable in society.

**Ms Campbell KC**: I suppose one of the consequences that your 2015 report identified, and I suspect you've identified on a number of occasions since, is that the effect of legislation that's out of date and that doesn't meet the needs of our ageing population is to disadvantage older people in terms of accessing what social care services are available to them, and also their loved ones in terms of understanding their route through that system. Is that something that you recognise as a problem?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yes, it is a problem. And I think one of the other things in Northern Ireland specifically is we don't have age discrimination legislation in goods, facilities and services, so we still remain the only part of the UK or Ireland that doesn't have that protection, and it leaves people vulnerable and not as protected as they could be.

There are other areas. For instance, in the last couple of months I've produced, published a report in relation to older people's rights in care homes in relation to their ten-year contract, the contract, and how they have very little rights in terms of -- and we have seen, as a result of that, issues around people being evicted from care homes, being moved out, being sent to hospital and then being refused admission back to their own home.

So these are all clearly deeply worrying aspects of the system that we have, and all of these issues need to be focused on going forward.

**Ms Campbell KC**: Her Ladyship heard evidence yesterday from Marion Reynolds, who explained that -- I don't know if you heard it yourself, Commissioner, but she had a long history of employment in the health and social care sector as a senior social worker, but notwithstanding her experience she found that the process of trying to access care for her aunt was really, I think, disempowering and difficult. Would that surprise you?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Unfortunately not. A lot of the cases that come to my office are with people dealing with the health system and the barriers that they face in raising legitimate concerns about care and treatment. It's very worrying. Again, I found that a lot in my Dunmurry Manor investigation, it was very obvious that people, family members who were actually very strong advocates for their loved ones found it very difficult to get anywhere with the system, to hear their genuine concerns to be heard, and not only that but the evidence I got in that investigation also showed that people working in the system felt the same way as well, people working in the system would have raised concerns at times and those concerns went unheeded, and that's deeply worrying so, you know, the likes of Marion giving evidence yesterday, unfortunately I have come across many older people in this role and my previous role who have worked in the health system and actually were very frustrated and actually felt quite often they'd got into campaigning organisations to try to change that and try to change that culture.

**Ms Campbell KC**: Ms Treanor, and I'm grateful to her, has focused on paragraph 68 of your statement, where we looked at that early guidance in March 2020, but I wonder if we could just move along in terms of the timeline to the period of autumn 2020 when again in your statement you draw attention to a letter that you had drafted to the Minister of Health, Mr Swann, on 8 October in which you highlight concerns in respect of the on-the-ground feasibility of the care partner guidance. Okay? We've heard something about that, and I know her Ladyship is familiar with it.

Again, I won't ask for it to be put on screen, but you say to the minister on 8 October that your office has spent the past four weeks dealing with calls from families in distress and they are angry when their care providers cannot deliver the access to their loved ones that they believe they should be entitled to and in fact under the guidance I think were entitled to.

You also are dealing with calls from home providers stating that they can't safely deliver the visiting arrangements that the guidance outlined, and you detail the distress on all sides when that guidance wasn't able to be put into practice, and we heard again something of that yesterday through the evidence of Marion Reynolds, and I think you'll know that it's also an area of significant concern to many of our client group, including Martina Ferguson, who I think has been in contact with you about her inability to visit her mother over a nine-month period.

Is it correct to say that as a consequence of that Department of Health issued guidance in September 2020, members of the public ought to have a legitimate expectation to get in to see their loved ones, to care for them again, after a large period in which they were denied that opportunity?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Yes, and I remember that period very well, because it had been becoming increasingly obvious to me that the lack of visiting was having a negative impact on the residents and the families, and I remember the Care Partner scheme being developed and it was a very welcome scheme. There was clearly lots of communication problems around that scheme. We did get several people coming to the office who were saying that the care home that their loved one was in was saying that they hadn't heard of the scheme, that they weren't aware of it, they weren't introducing it. So there was a mixed picture out there. The Care Partner scheme was a step forward in at least getting some family contact again, but I remember still that there was ongoing issues, and Martina was one of the people who came to our office and, you know, was desperate to visit her mother, Ursula, in the home, and there was clearly still a lot of uncertainty out there in the care home sector about what they could do.

There was also a lot of fear, because a lot of care home providers were coming back around liability issues, insurance issues, there was a lot of uncertainty from their behalf. But there was clearly some homes doing it better than others, and I think some homes certainly communicating that service was available better than others, because when it worked, it worked well.

**Ms Campbell KC**: Did those problems persist significantly after your letter of 8 October and further into the winter?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: It was a gradual process. I remember that whole situation with visiting for months on end, it was gradually getting better, but it did take several months before it seemed to go through the system. And there was a lack of consistency, and I think, I don't know whether some of that was down to care homes having the staffing arrangements, the resources in place to put it in place. I think there was certainly part of that where homes were struggling in terms of staff numbers, and again that's something that we need to reflect on, because we need to have a stronger social care workforce going forward in the future in terms of, you know, providing them with better pay and conditions and, you know, reflecting on the brilliant role that social care workers played throughout the pandemic. So -- but that whole issue of visiting was a very complicated one. I remember there was an ongoing group with members of the families, you know, with the department, with the Public Health Agency, and was clearly by that stage an area that we were very aware of and the families were very conscious of as well.

**Ms Campbell KC**: Just finally picking up on the question from her Ladyship earlier, that is surely an area that we can work on to do better in the future?

**Mr Eddie Lynch**: Absolutely, I think that issue of human contact and visiting would have to be something that in a future pandemic needs to get better.

**Ms Campbell**: Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Campbell.

Thank you, Mr Lynch, for all you did and tried to do, and don't give up, keep banging the drum.

**The Witness**: Thanks very much, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.
