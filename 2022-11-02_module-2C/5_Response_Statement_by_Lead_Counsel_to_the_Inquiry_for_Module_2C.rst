5. Response Statement by Lead Counsel to the Inquiry for Module 2C
==================================================================

**Ms Dobbin**: Very few, my Lady.

My Lady, once again I hope that brevity will not be regarded as discourteous, but my learned friends have made important points and those are matters that I know you will want to consider with care. So there were just a couple of things.

Mr Lavery raised the issue of pen portraits. To anyone who hasn't followed the other hearings, they may not realise that that issue has been discussed and ventilated previously as well, and that it's something you have considered carefully and also dealt with in your ruling in response to the hearing that took place in Module 1, and that the real issue again goes back to the scale of the deaths that occurred and the real difficulty that that presents in terms of pen portrait evidence, and how it would ever be possible to pick, for example, between persons whose portraits would be conveyed at a hearing.

I just thought it was important to make sure people understood that that has been considered at some length, and that, as you've already said, the issue of how to commemorate appropriately and respectfully is something that you continue to keep under consideration.

As regards Mr Lavery's other point about the potential of your sitting with a panel, as distinct from experts who might advise as a panel, my Lady, as you've pointed out, whether or not an inquiry chair should ever sit with a panel is properly a matter, in this Inquiry, for the Prime Minister as the sponsoring minister. That would be a matter for him.

Some short additional points. This is one UK Inquiry, and Module 2C is an integral part of Module 2 as well, and there's an issue of law as to whether part of an Inquiry could ever sit with a panel, and not other parts of the Inquiry. And that's because section 3 of the Inquiries Act expressly refers to an Inquiry being undertaken by a Chair alone or with other members, so it only seems to foresee the whole of an Inquiry being undertaken by panelists.

My Lady, I thought it was also important to say that, of course, because in A, B and C you have appointed a counsel team for each, and they are separate modules, that also facilitates a deeper understanding of how the structures within which those devolved nations work as well and, in the case of Northern Ireland, how those Northern Irish structures and institutions interacted with counterparts in the Republic of Ireland as well.

My Lady, as regards the submissions made by Ms Anyadike-Danes, I think the concern of the Commissioner shines through about the issues that he encountered as the pandemic unfolded and the efforts that he made to communicate those. But it is right to point out, as you indeed have done, and again for the benefit of the public, that the focus of Module 2A, B and C is on the key decisions and the key decision-making process by those at the highest level of government, and that the impact of those decisions will then be looked at as the Inquiry develops.

Obviously that's, and I say this again, to give comfort that those granular issues about how decisions played out in other sectors will be afforded more detailed consideration as the Inquiry develops.

Is there anything else that I can assist you with?

**Lady Hallett**: No, I'm extremely grateful to you as well, Ms Dobbin, thank you very much indeed.

Thank you, everybody. That completes this morning's hearing. I'm grateful to those who have attended in person, and to those who have made submissions. And, again -- I don't know how many times I have expressed my gratitude this week, but I'll do it one last time --
