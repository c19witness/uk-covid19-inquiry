3. Submissions on Behalf of the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland by Ms Anyadike-danes
=======================================================================================================

**Ms Anyadike-Danes**: I think it's still good morning, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: It is just.

**Ms Anyadike-Danes**: And it's very nearly that. It's Anyadike-Danes.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm so sorry! I did ask. I do apologise. As Mr Lavery has confirmed, I have been having a few problems with words.

**Ms Anyadike-Danes**: Well, firstly, by way of introduction, I appear for the Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland, and I'm here with my instructing solicitor, Aimee Miller, who is head of legal services for the Commissioner. And participating remotely is my junior, Bobbie-Leigh Herdman.

The first thing I want to do is to, on behalf of the Commissioner, thank you for granting him core participant status for this module.

He hopes that may not be the only one. But in any event, for now, to thank you for that. And also for permitting me to make these oral submissions on his behalf.

I want to really do two things with the opportunity that your Ladyship has given me. The first is to say something about the Commissioner's constituency, his role and his concerns. Partly because there are other people participating remotely or who will read about this hereafter who may not be aware of what that is, although I certainly hope all his constituencies are, but also because not everyone in the four jurisdictions has a Commissioner for Older People, and so it might be informative from that point of view.

So I want to say something about that, and his objective for participating in this Inquiry.

Then the other thing I want to do is really to pick up on some of the matters that we addressed in the written submissions, which were primarily directed to your legal team's note which, frankly, we found very helpful indeed, as did we find Ms Dobbin's address this morning.

So that's what I really want to do, and of course respond to anything that your Ladyship may ask of me.

So if I start with the Commissioner's constituency and role. As of March 2021, Northern Ireland had an over 60s older population of approximately 439,600. And that represents, at that time, some 23% of the total population of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has some 473 residential care homes catering for that population. There are residential care homes that cater for other populations of vulnerable people who may become relevant as your Ladyship moves forward in the terms of reference. But for that population, there is about 473. And that is catered for through about 11,400 care packages. And that does not include domiciliary care, so that's care packages just for those care homes. Nearly all of those care packages are commissioned from the private sector.

The disproportionate adverse impact of Covid-19 on that population is accepted readily by Northern Ireland's Minister for Health, and I'm sure your Ladyship has seen various iterations of these statistics, but what he said is that:

"The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on older people: 90% of Covid-19 deaths in the first wave of the pandemic were in people aged over 65. Around half of Covid-19 deaths in Northern Ireland occurred in a care home."

So that is actually a very stark perspective from which to view the work to be done in this module and the Commissioner's particular interest and involvement in it.

The Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland was established in accordance with the Commissioner for Older People Act (Northern Ireland) of 2011, and the principal aim of that legislation, which is enshrined in section 2, was to safeguard -- it's an important term in this context -- and promote the interests of older people in Northern Ireland. And he has mandatory duties in relation to delivering that.

The Commissioner represents the interests of potentially over 600,000 older people and their families in Northern Ireland, and this includes people experiencing a broad spectrum of personal circumstances. So he deals with those who live in their own homes, those who live at home but they are almost entirely reliant on domiciliary care, those who live in supported living or in residential care homes, as well as those who are in hospitals and hospices and those in prison establishments. It's a very, very broad spectrum of people. And the statistics and the lived experience would suggest that his constituents are and were uniquely vulnerable to experiencing long-term physical or mental health conditions, loneliness, and to feel more significant the physical impacts of being required to shield, quite apart from being very vulnerable to Covid-19 itself, arising out of perhaps their age or co-morbidities.

The Commissioner has sought to deliver particularly through the pandemic for that constituency in accordance with his mandatory duties, and some of those mandatory duties are particularly relevant to the work of not just this module but the work of the Inquiry more broadly than that.

So he is required to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice relating to the interests of older people and the adequacy and effectiveness of services provided for older people by relevant authorities. That's a very specific area, but he has to keep that under review.

As you're aware, my Lady, there is a significant difference between that law and practice in Northern Ireland and that of the other jurisdictions. In Northern Ireland the health and social care systems are integrated with both limbs being under the responsibility and control of the Department of Health. That might have brought very considerable benefits to dealing with something like a pandemic, particularly in relation to an older population, and one of the Commissioner's concerns over the preparation for, the response to, and the management of the pandemic is the extent to which Northern Ireland may actually have squandered the advantages that should have accrued from its integrated system. And that's an issue, when one is looking at decision-making, that we hope your Ladyship is going to bear in mind.

So, the Commissioner's publications demonstrate the depth of that knowledge, both his and that of his Office, prior to the pandemic, let alone that gained as policies were being formulated and regulations were being introduced.

So, for example, there is his 2014 report to the minister, "Changing the culture of care in Northern Ireland", and the 2015 report, "[Preparing] to care? Modernising Adult Social Care in Northern Ireland". Now, that particular report was based on research that was commissioned from the Queen's University Belfast, and its objectives were to identify gaps and issues surrounding the current, as it was then, legislative framework including the policy provision for adult social care in Northern Ireland.

And also to compare Northern Ireland with best practice in other jurisdictions including the Republic of Ireland, of which your Ladyship has heard quite a lot so far. And not only just to look at that in an academic sort of way and from the statistical material, but to make recommendations as to whether -- well, firstly, of course, and most basically, whether there was any need for any legislative reform at all. And if there was, to suggest what that might be, and how best to change the current framework in Northern Ireland to provide better support for outcomes for older people. And it also involved, interestingly, a stakeholder engagement element with a round table event to discuss outcomes and recommendations.

All of this highlighted the serious concerns over the provision of care to older people pre-pandemic. And that, to a degree, is part of what we understand your Ladyship will be considering in Module 1.

Then, the Commissioner must also promote an awareness of matters relating to the interests of older persons and the need to safeguard those interests. And that, perhaps -- the delivery of that mandatory requirement was very much to the fore during the pandemic as it developed.

And fundamental to that role was staying connected with his constituency. And he did that through a wide variety of ways, many of which are set out in our written submissions and I don't propose to go through them now.

But suffice it to say that from the earliest days of the pandemic, the Commissioner played a direct and significant role in relaying his concerns and those of the older people and their families to the decision-making bodies at the highest level, and regularly communicating updates from them back to the older population on key developments throughout the pandemic.

Now, Mr Lavery has talked about the engagement that you had in Northern Ireland, and the impact on you and others, I understand, in the room in hearing the raw description of the impact of what happened. Yes, it is very challenging to hear that. And in his direct engagement with his constituency, that is what the Commissioner and his office heard day in, day out throughout the pandemic. And that, actually, when one looks for what is the impetus of something, that is what provided the impetus for him to be relaying what he could see, as far as he was concerned, were some of the issues up to those who had the ability to make decisions and formulate policy, and to try and explain to them what was being formulated and how it was intended that would help them.

That's not an easy thing to do for the length of time the pandemic existed.

And it still happens, because there are still those who are literally burdened by the outcome of what happened, and that he is charged to deal with them and to continue to represent their interests in whatever way it is that the decision-making bodies can seek to, if not address them, certainly try and explain how it happened.

Additionally, the Commissioner took part in weekly meetings of the Older People UK Network during the pandemic. Now, that's important, because your Ladyship has heard and also recognised the differences between what was happening in the four jurisdictions, and I think Ms Dobbin made reference to the extent to which they were not in lock-step, I think was her expression. One of the issues is to look at: and what difference did it make that they weren't in lock-step? And, for that matter: what difference might it have made if they were in lock-step?

Well, the extent to which they weren't in lock-step was something that became very much apparent to the Commissioner as he participated with others in the Older People UK Network, because that provided a forum for representatives of statutory and charitable organisations from all four nations of the UK to share information, co-ordinate public comment, and actually try to keep track of the frequently changing regulations in each region and to see to what extent any of that, if it was different to what was happening in their particular jurisdiction, might be helpful. And that was again something that could be taken back and fed up to the decision-making bodies.

The Commissioner, of course, continues to engage, as I have indicated, with his constituents on a daily basis, and he hopes that makes him particularly well placed to reflect their views to your Ladyship in this part of the Inquiry and also their concerns.

So, coming now to the Commissioner's concerns and objectives, the Commissioner, in pursuance of his statutory duties, is required to advise the Secretary of State, the Executive Committee of the Assembly, and the relevant authority on matters concerning the interests of older persons, either when he gets a specific request or just when he considers it appropriate to do so. And in service of this duty, the Commissioner took an extremely proactive role during the pandemic. He was publicly calling for universal testing in care homes from as early as 23 April 2020. In fact, his first publication at all went out on throughout the pandemic he actively participated in and made recommendations at frequent pandemic response meetings with the Department of Health, Public Health Agency and the RQIA (the Regulation & Quality Improvement Authority), and on 4 June of 2020 he and his senior team, by invitation, gave evidence to the Committee for Health's inquiry into Covid-19 and its impact on care homes. He gave that evidence and much of what he said there is to be seen reflected in the recommendations that it made.

Now, the purpose of all of this is not simply to describe, if you like, the impact of what was happening so far as he could see it in his engagement with his

constituency and their families. The purpose was to use

the information he had, together with his own knowledge

and experience, of the weaknesses in the health and

social care sector, on behalf of older people, to seek

to contribute to the formulation of policy, improving

policy, and generally the response of decision-makers to

the pandemic that unfolded. That's what it was for. It

wasn't really just to simply describe what was

happening. It was for a purpose. And the purpose of

which is what your Ladyship is considering in this

module. March 2020. That's how early he was engaged. And                      12          If one thinks about some of what he was publishing,

he was looking at: the impact of lockdown on the older

population and the adverse impact on human rights,

influencing public health policies; the lack of

sufficient PPE in care homes; ageist decisions that were

being taken by medical professionals regarding

the entitlement, for example, to ventilators;

discriminatory and ageist practice on Do Not Resuscitate

forms on older patients without consulting the patient

or their families; the government failure to record care

home deaths when following advice from

the Commissioner -- that actually was ultimately

implemented at some point; the importance of testing

staff and residents regularly; the vaccination programme roll-out for older people; the disproportionate deaths in care home settings compared to the community, particularly when compared to the other areas of the UK, and your Ladyship has heard some of that earlier this morning; and of course the deaths in care homes caused by the discharge of hospital patients to care homes.

That is what he was reflecting and that is what he was hoping would be considered when policy was being formulated and regulations were being made. We know now that from 19 March 2020 to 14 October 2022 there were 4,892 Covid-related deaths recorded in Northern Ireland. And from what I said before, your Ladyship will know that the majority of them were amongst older people.

But not just that, the Commissioner is also conscious of the many and often undocumented people who continue to suffer the effects of Covid-19, whether it's because of long Covid or it's because of delays in surgeries and other healthcare services, and the disproportionate impact of waiting lists for elective surgeries on older people and the exacerbation of that problem due to the pandemic.

The Commissioner in this is not just wanting to know or have a clearer exposition of what happened. In fact, from the engagement with his constituency, he is pretty clear of much of what happened: people died and suffered and their families continue to do so. What he hopes this Inquiry will do is to find out why that happened and how it happened. So, why it all went so wrong and how it went so wrong.

That's what he hopes will be the outcome, and that is why he is so motivated to participate.

And not just for the answer to that question, but for the answer to that question to be used, as I think your Ladyship has indicated on earlier occasions in relation to other parts of the work, to ensure that, so far as one can do it, that doesn't happen again. Nobody, I think, feels that there will never be another pandemic. What we don't want is one of the type in terms of the outcome that happened with Covid-19.

Then the Senior Counsel to the Inquiry in this section, Ms Dobbin has set out the list of enhanced rights, I think she called them, that go with being a core participant.

I want to say, my Lady, that the Commissioner takes that very seriously, the fact that those are rights that accrue to a core participant. But, more specifically, the opportunity that gives, and to use that in the interests, yes, of his constituency but also to assist the Inquiry in its work so far as he can do that. The Commissioner wants to assure your Ladyship and your team that he intends to do all he can as a core participant in this module to assist the Inquiry from his expertise, experience and network. And to that end he is prepared to meet the Inquiry team as early as possible and engage with them in whatever way they consider productive.

And I have to say, and this I would like to pass on, on behalf of Ms Miller and myself, my thanks to the Inquiry team, because actually that engagement has already started. We already met them. Almost the first thing what we did when we arrived here was to meet them and to have what we thought to be a very productive introduction. And we're very grateful for that and we certainly hope that that kind of interaction can continue.

So then finally, just on why the Commissioner is being involved: he welcomes, my Lady, your desire to progress as expeditiously as possible without compromising on receiving the important material and evidence that will inform your recommendations. He noted what was said in the transcript for Module 1. That actually is his aim.

The Commissioner also notes your reference to delivering the Inquiry's ambitious timetable will require the full co-operation of core participants and others, and your Ladyship repeated that today, and he confirms that he will do all that he can within his remit to further precisely that. And that includes welcoming the opportunity to provide relevant documents and evidence in ways that can be developed more with your team.

I just want to say some matters about the scope of the module, what I might call the discovery issue, if you like, which are the Rule 9 requests and disclosure, and experts, if I may. I hope I'm not trespassing too much on the time.

**Lady Hallett**: If you could focus on the -- I have read your written submissions.

**Ms Anyadike-Danes**: I'm very grateful.

So, since you have, then one of the areas that the Commissioner really wants to work with is really something that Mr Lavery spoke about, which is care homes. Your Ladyship has indicated that you will look at that.

There are some very unique elements of what happened in care homes as a result of the pandemic. If one sees, for example, the impact of lockdown and the lack of physical inspection or attendance of families that was possible during the pandemic. The Commissioner is very concerned that in the absence of that, if you like, the outside world lost its eyes and ears on what was happening in care homes. And he is very much aware of that and aware that how issues to do with isolation and reduction of -- within the care homes -- interpersonal contact, all of that was a matter that was managed individually by care homes in a way that didn't necessarily allow others to be appreciative of how that was happening and how that might have been improved.

**Lady Hallett**: Can I just interrupt there?

**Ms Anyadike-Danes**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: Just to make things clear, there will be a module that focuses on the care sector.

**Ms Anyadike-Danes**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: This module is focusing on key decision-making and whether or not the key decision-makers took into account the impact on various groups, like people in the care home, the elderly, children and the like. So when it comes to the really detailed kind of aspects you're talking about, that is more likely to be dealt with in the care home sector; its only subject matter will be the care sector.

**Ms Anyadike-Danes**: Yes, well, I'm very grateful for that, my Lady, and I did understand, certainly even from what the Senior Counsel to the Inquiry on the Welsh module said yesterday, that there was going to be an element on the care sector. And that brings me to another area that the Commissioner has an interest in, and it may be that we can take this forward in discussion with your team, which is: when one looks at the health sector, which is Module 3, as we understand it, and the care sector at some module at some stage perhaps later on, for Northern Ireland what was happening -- and by that, for the purposes of this, I mean the decision-making of what was happening and the way they took the experiences of what was being described, and the concerns about it, back up the line, if I can put it that way, to feature in policy and decision-making.

For Northern Ireland, actually, the care home straddles both those. So it's not really possible effectively to look at that decision-making and policy making discretely in healthcare or in social care, because of the -- the way the integrated system works, it's -- one would not get a proper picture of the hows and the whys in relation to decision-making without being able to look at how those -- both those sectors came together in the care home sector.

So I will say no more about that, because I'm sure that is something that can be developed with your team as to how we don't necessarily end up into over -- into unnecessary duplication, but also don't miss anything that's relevant for decision-making.

So, if I can then just deal very, very quickly with the Rule 9 requests and the disclosure.

By and large, much of -- since your Ladyship has been good enough to read the submission -- what has been said there we can take forward. All that we would want to do is to ensure that there is sufficient information being provided so that, from the Commissioner's expertise, he is able to assist in either the identification of further recipients of Rule 9 requests or, for that matter, be able to help as to where there might be some gaps in the material being provided to you.

He has a real interest in ensuring that there aren't gaps, as I'm sure your Ladyship does also. So that's just a matter of the provision of information ahead of time so that he can meaningfully assist with that.

There is another matter, but it's reflected in our written statement, and that is because -- and I don't believe that it's only an overlap likely between Module 3 and any social care module, but within the Module 2 and Module 2C there may well be matters where it would assist if the core participants could have sight of some of what was happening and had been provided in other modules. I'm sure there's a system that can be devised that will allow that without compromising anything of significance. Everybody will obviously have provided their undertakings, and so that obviously gives comfort to the Inquiry. And one doesn't want to duplicate the Inquiry's work by getting them to sort of involve a whole load of people who aren't directly relevant to the module in hand. But there may well be some purposeful dissemination that could happen as between material that comes, for example, in Module 2 and material that is going to arise in Module 2C.

On the -- finally, then -- instruction of expert witnesses, I listened with interest to what Mr Lavery was saying about how he wondered whether your Ladyship would consider a panel of experts. I must say I'd rather got the impression from the note that your senior counsel provided to us all that your Ladyship was considering effectively a panel in the sense of a resource panel, as opposed to a decision-making panel, and that, if I may respectfully say so, we think is a very good idea.

What actually was set out there in terms of the areas that have already been identified, I think there were four of them, (a) through to (d), I don't think there's anything there immediately that the Commissioner would necessarily think there is a gap. It may well be that you can see discrete elements as you work through become -- of very particular specialisms, and I think he understands that there will be an opportunity to respond, and also if there are particular identities of experts -- we note that that's already happened for one core participant in Module 1 -- and if that becomes a helpful thing to do, then we will be engaging on that.

But there is just one element, when I -- and I noted it when I was looking through -- at the areas for expertise. It's in relation to (b) where it describes the systems for measuring and estimating infections and deaths and the registration of deaths and overall figures for infection and death. It's more to do with, really, the deaths and the registration of deaths. It may well be that in dealing with the scope of this area -- and it's always very difficult when you're trying to set out a broad canvas, because the more you give individual bits, somebody thinks of their little bit that wasn't added on clearly is being left off. And we understand that these parts that are being described are indicative only and that your Ladyship is trying to be inclusive rather than exclusive. But in terms of the deaths, there are issues to do with death certification in care homes and the guidance that was given to coroners as to the occasions when there ought to be an inquest into those sorts of deaths.

Now, that is guidance, and that came from policy, and it may be that -- I don't believe that your Ladyship is necessarily excluding it, but there may be issues like that, that the Commissioner sees, and we can engage with your team about that, and that might be helpful generally.

So that's really all I want to say about what came through from the note. I would just like to conclude with this: to reassure your Ladyship and your team that working with this Inquiry is an absolute priority for the Commissioner, and he hopes there is a shared objective, which -- I think he has gleaned that hope from all that's been said so far, to find out what happened, learn the lessons for the future, and move as quickly as is reasonable and feasible to the issuing of effective recommendations. Because that's the tool that he hopes can be used for the future.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed. I'm very grateful.

I can certainly confirm we share the same objectives, and I do welcome the Commissioner's interest. He's obviously played a very significant role representing a very important constituency, and I'm very grateful for his offers of help and indeed those that you have offered.

So thank you very much indeed.

**Ms Anyadike-Danes**: Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Jacobs.
