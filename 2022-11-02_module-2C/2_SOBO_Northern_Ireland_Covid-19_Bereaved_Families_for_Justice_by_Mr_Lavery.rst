2. Submissions on Behalf of Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Lavery
================================================================================================

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Lavery.

**Mr Lavery**: Good morning, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Good morning, Mr Lavery.

**Mr Lavery**: As your Ladyship knows, at this stage the people I represent are the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, and I have outlined before, but for the purposes of this, I'm just going to say very briefly who these people are.

First of all, they're a formidable group of people, headed by Martina Ferguson, who is here, and she is over at the Inquiry today, my Lady, and Brenda Doherty. And they're represented by myself and Conan Fegan, Malachy McGowan, and the team from PA Duffy, who are over here today as well, and represented that group at the Module 1 and Module 2 on which I've already addressed your Ladyship.

This is the first module dealing specifically with Northern Ireland but, as I said to your Ladyship in Module 1, we and the people I represent first met you at a Listening Exercise in the Europa Hotel in Belfast in March, and indicated to you at that previous preliminary hearing how much everybody was struck by the humanity you showed at that event and how moved you were, and everybody, by the accounts given, the personal accounts given of everybody there. It was a group of about 15 or 20 people. And how deeply impacted those people were by the -- not just the effect of the bereavement, but the impact that the restrictions had on their last moments with their loved ones, and saying goodbye to their loved ones, and those end of life decisions that they were forced to make in the most difficult and extreme circumstances, without any advice and with very little support.

I say that by way of opening, and we have addressed in the previous modules the issue of the Listening Exercise and how that might evolve and the process that the Inquiry is putting in place to deal with that, and what I wanted to share as well was, at that event in the Europa, how you shared with us the impact that hearing accounts like that had on you at that event and in previous inquiries in which you had been involved, deep personal impact.

I'm not going to go over how the Listening Exercise is to be carried out, but there is room, we think, still for a -- because of the scale of this module and the amount of people involved, that the Inquiry would at least keep under consideration some form of pen portrait exercise when the Inquiry sits in Northern Ireland, for instance, or at some stage. That would be very important to the people that I represent.

We welcome the other core participants that are here today as well, my Lady. The TUC are making an important contribution, have done in the other modules. And of course today we have the Commissioner for Older People of Northern Ireland.

We agree that it wouldn't be possible to set out -- it wouldn't be practically possible to set out in any detail all of the issues that will be addressed in the course of the Inquiry. And as Ms Dobbin said in her address to your Ladyship earlier on today, she did carefully and accurately summarise the thrust of our submissions about what should and might be -- should be the focus of Module 2C. We are encouraged. It's a mark, I think, of the role that the core participants can and will play that our submissions so far have been listened to and the response from Ms Dobbin today to those submissions is very much to be welcomed.

For instance, when she says that the focus -- that there will be a focus on those who held the highest offices in Northern Ireland, that the role of the central government she addressed your Ladyship upon earlier, and how does that fit between Module 2 and Module 2C, that central government's awareness of the unique situation of Northern Ireland, what kind of contingency there was for that, and what the response was.

I have addressed your Ladyship on the uniqueness of the situation in Northern Ireland, and Ms Dobbin referred in particular this morning to the -- which I know has been addressed by the TUC in their submissions -- the three-year hiatus up until January of 2020. But unfortunately what is an ongoing feature of Northern Ireland has been periods when there has been no Assembly, or no functioning Assembly, or the mandatory coalition arrangement that is government devolved in Northern Ireland under the Good Friday Agreement. It's uncontroversial to say at this stage, my Lady, during another period of no Assembly and no government, that there is a state of dysfunction in devolved government in Northern Ireland which central government ought to be aware of, as I say, ought to make contingency for, and be able to respond to.

I mention that when I say that our submissions are and have been addressed. I also say, my Lady, it's very important that we're here and that we make contact with the Inquiry team on a personal basis, and we want to offer our support and collaboration with the team, and so I'm highlighting these as features where we have raised issues and that they appear to have been addressed and considered by the team.

For instance again, and Ms Dobbin referred to this earlier, that the Rule 9 requests would be targeted at the issue of co-operation with the Republic of Ireland dealing with those matters that we dealt with in our written submissions.

Just touching on those submissions, my Lady, and I mentioned the unique features of Northern Ireland. Of course there's the dysfunctional devolved government, but two other prominent features are that we don't have an NHS as such, we have a universal healthcare arrangement where health is dealt with together with social care by the same bodies -- there are five separate bodies dealing with this -- and how they joined up, how their thinking was joined up, if it was at all. And of course the Inquiry will want to look at how far those senior politicians and decisions they made filtered all the way down to decisions that were made on the ground.

So that's the unique feature. But of course the island of Ireland as a single -- it's a word I struggle with, my Lady, your Ladyship referred to it -- juridical -- on Monday -- epidemiological unit.

Of course, that goes without saying when you think about it, but such is the nature and history, which again Ms Dobbin referred to, about Northern Ireland that it is sometimes forgotten.

The island of Ireland -- there is a reference to border controls and the extent to which decisions were informed by the response of the Government of the Republic of Ireland, and Ms Dobbin has indicated today that -- how that will be fleshed out and looked at, and that is to be welcomed.

So there's the epidemiological unit and then there's the memorandum of understanding that existed between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland Health ministers.

It came as a surprise to us when we were looking at this, my Lady, that for the last 24 years there has been a single all-island institute for public health for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which was set up under the Good Friday Agreement and is directly accountable to the Chief Medical Officers in Belfast and Dublin. This was looked at by SAGE in its report of 12 May 2020, and when they were looking at managing the risk of exporting and importing cases from countries with high risks of transmission, they identified a serious loophole where they said it will be perfectly possible for someone to fly from somewhere where the level of infection is extremely high, such as New York to Dublin, and then change planes to travel to London. For this and for other reasons related to the extent of movement across the Irish border, it makes much more sense either to treat the two main islands of Britain and Ireland as separate entities for human health purposes, as is already the case for animal health, or for the UK and Republic of Ireland to agree a common approach.

Again, I mentioned that, in Module 2, what connection was there between the governments in Dublin and London, and what impact the common travel area has on dealing with matters relating to the pandemic.

And that there were three issues identified by Dr Scally, who is Honorary Professor of Public Health at University of Bristol and president of the Epidemiology and Public Health section of the Royal Society of Medicine, and he said that there are three outstanding issues that require an urgent all-Ireland response. One was the investigation of the relatively high incidence of cases of coronavirus in the border counties of the south. And the second is the difficult issue of putting airport restrictions. The third is the nonsensical difference between the recommendation, under some circumstances, of 14 days' isolation in the south and seven days in the north. And he wrote further in February 2021 again identifying:

"... two missing components of successful zero Covid strategy in Ireland ... firstly, mandatory hotel quarantining for travellers arriving on the island and secondly, effective north-south co-operation."

Just to quote him briefly, my Lady, if I may:

"You cannot have this situation, which we know doesn't work, of voluntary self-isolation combined with a lack of co-operation north and south ... Government ministers in Dublin insist that it is impossible to cooperate with the North because of the DUP and we can't have an all-island strategy. In reality, it's a failure of the body politic, both north and south.

"Meanwhile, we have now far exceeded the number of deaths from 'the Troubles'. Don't tell me it's impossible for the administrations north and south to co-operate on this; that is stupid."

These difficulties again were highlighted by a study entitled "Obstacles to Public Health That Even Pandemics Cannot Overcome: The Politics of COVID-19 on the Island of Ireland". Again, just to quote briefly from that study:

"Public health narratives that frame the island of Ireland as a [single epidemiological unit] or for Covid-19 are seen to push NI one step closer to a united Ireland, and coming on foot of the Brexit trade deal between the UK and the EU, unionist concerns are at an all-time high. Ultimately, Brexit has further 'politicised and toxified the British-Irish political landscape' so much so that public health responses are automatically viewed as constitutional threats."

And they go on to say:

"... however, this study has demonstrated substantial public health policy alignment brought about through ongoing dialogue and cooperation between the health administrations in each jurisdiction. While this is cause for optimism, the outbreak of Covid-19 on the island of Ireland is a reminder that there are political obstacles to public health that even pandemics cannot overcome."

The idea that political decisions were made in Northern Ireland against the background of binary constitutional issues -- should we follow Dublin or London in the way that we approach a pandemic? -- and how much that featured is something that's important to look at in the Northern Irish context.

Then, my Lady, the second issue under this is this memorandum of understanding that was arrived at between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland Health ministers, and this was formulated on 7 April 2020 where the memorandum of understanding committed the NI Executive and the Republic of Ireland Government to "coordination and cooperation" in response to Covid-19, with the active involvement of health administrations to protect as paramount "the lives and welfare of everyone on the island ... and no effort will be spared in that regard".

Again, Dr Scally commented on this and described it as a meaningless document:

"The language remains great and the sentiment is excellent, but I don't think anyone could point to anything that it has influenced for the better. There is no use in having this wonderful tool is no one is prepared to pick it up and use it."

And the failure to put that to proper use we say were choices or failures of political and administrative decision-makers, and which clearly had a deleterious impact upon the way the pandemic was managed.

Ms Dobbin has mentioned the issue of care homes, which we raised, and that that will be a central issue to be looked at. 30% of all deaths in Northern Ireland from the pandemic occurred in care homes.

The issue of Rule 9 requests, my Lady, has been dealt with, and we addressed you in previous submissions relating to that. I'm not going to dilate on that any further nor on the issue of disclosure to core participants.

We have suggested that there might be a role for expert panels as happened in at least two other Inquiries in Northern Ireland, the Inquiry into Urology Services, and the Neurology Inquiry in Northern Ireland, that is --

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry to interrupt, Mr Lavery. By that you mean expert panel advisers or panelists to sit with me as decision-makers?

**Mr Lavery**: Well, panel expert -- this is something that has -- it can be looked at either way. I mean, we have an open mind about this as well. But it's something -- first of all, panel members, and the identity of those, and whether or not there is going to be panel members for Northern Ireland, and whether they're going to be bespoke, with a particular knowledge of and interest in the issues that we're looking at and Republic of Ireland issues. But I'm certainly not suggesting that your role, my Lady, should be usurped in some way by a panel of experts, a panel working with your Ladyship in that regard, and who can advise and look at material --

**Lady Hallett**: I was only asking --

**Mr Lavery**: -- (overspeaking) -- not just on an individual basis.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry to interrupt you. I was only asking because, as you know, to have decision-making panel members is a matter for the Prime Minister, not for me.

**Mr Lavery**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: But I certainly have been looking at, and as Ms Dobbin outlined, the idea of having panels of experts to advise the Inquiry is something I think is well worth exploring.

**Mr Lavery**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: So maybe we're saying the same thing.

**Mr Lavery**: It may well be, my Lady. But again, and I hope this will be an ongoing feature of the collaboration in this Inquiry, that it's something we've raised and that Ms Dobbin has indicated in her submissions today she is looking at, and your Ladyship as well, actively considering those issues which we raise and that we think highlights the role -- the important role that core participants can play in the Inquiry going forward.

So, my Lady, that is all that I wish to say at this stage, unless I can be of any further assistance.

**Lady Hallett**: No, I'm very grateful, Mr Lavery. I have expressed my gratitude to you before, but I will do it again, because this is an independent module. You were there, you know how moving an experience I found meeting the bereaved during the consultation exercise, and Belfast was a particularly moving visit. And I learnt at first-hand the -- bereavement is bad enough but bereavement during a time of pandemic is something very different, and very much worse. And I certainly was grateful for the bereaved who attended and explained, gave their accounts of what had happened to them.

As far as -- which leads into the pen portrait evidence question. I suspect there may be ways in which I can meet my duties and my aims and allay your concerns, so I promise you that is a matter that is still under consideration. It may not be what you would call pen portrait evidence, but there will be ways, I'm sure, in which we can make sure that each module has that human element. This is not just a question of calling decision-makers, but it has the human element. So I promise you I am still thinking about subjects of that kind.

And as far as the issues you raised about the relationship with the Republic of Ireland, they're very important issues, I am very conscious of them. And as you heard, Ms Dobbin and the team are also very conscious of them. And with your assistance and the assistance of other core participants, we will investigate them thoroughly.

So thank you again for your help and your offers of collaboration and co-operation. Thank you.

**Mr Lavery**: Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Right. Is it Ms Anyadike-Danes?
