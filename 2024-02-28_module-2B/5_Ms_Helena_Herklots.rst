Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

If we could be careful about moving around when people are taking the oath, I'd be really grateful. Thank you. It's finished now. Just for the future. Sorry to be pernickety, it's too many years in the courts.

**Ms Hitchman**: Could you commence, please, by giving your full name.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Helena Rebecca Herklots.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you for attending today, Commissioner, and for assisting the Inquiry. As you give your evidence, please remember to keep your voice up and speak slowly so that the stenographer can hear you for the transcript.

Your witness statement for this module is at INQ000276281. Are the contents of this statement true and accurate to the best of your knowledge and belief?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Yes, they are.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You are the Older People's Commissioner for Wales and you have held this position since 2018. You were therefore the Older People's Commissioner during the period with which we are concerned, namely January 2020 to May 2022; is that correct?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: There are five topics I would like to explore with you this afternoon, the first is your role as the Older People's Commissioner, the second is your engagement with the Welsh Government, third is care homes, fourth is your report entitled "Leave no-one behind", and, fifth, your joint working with the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and by way of conclusion we'll look briefly at the lessons learned that you've set out in your report -- in your witness statement.

So I want to ask you some questions about the role of the Older People's Commissioner. The Commissioner is an independent statutory role with the remit to protect and promote the rights of older people in Wales; is that right?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And the role was established by Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Act 2006, and importantly that defines "older person" as a person aged 60 or over. Is that right?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Please can you provide a general overview of the role and functions of the Older People's Commissioner?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So the key role is to protect and promote the rights of everyone over the age of 60 in Wales, a very diverse group of older people, and I've got a number of functions that I'm required to carry out. So that's about representing the interests of older people and safeguarding those interests, scrutinising the actions of public bodies, so bodies such as Welsh Government, health boards and local authorities. I'm able to provide direct assistance and advice to individual older people and to keep under review the effectiveness and adequacy of the law as it relates to older people as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you, Commissioner.

The commissioner also has legal powers which are limited to the areas over which the Welsh Government has competency. Please could you provide an overview of those legal powers.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So I'm able to scrutinise public bodies, so to look at the way in which they discharge their functions or fail to discharge their functions as that affects older people. I have the legal power to set out and produce guidance for public bodies that they have to give regard to, so report to me on. I'm able to help individual older people, providing advice and assistance and supporting them in cases or complaints, for example. And I can carry out research and publish research drawing on the experiences of older people.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Aside from those legal powers, you explain in your witness statement that the commissioner is able to consider and make representations to the Welsh ministers, the First Minister and the Counsel General on any matter relating to the interests of older people in Wales, and this can include non-devolved as well as devolved matters.

So the scope of your legal powers doesn't prevent you from making general representations to the Welsh Government about the interests of older people, notwithstanding that they are not within the competencies or devolved responsibilities of the Welsh Government; is that right?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: That's correct. And it's important, because it means that I can make representations, for example, on issues of poverty and income for older people, which is a reserved matter to the UK Government.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Turning now to look at your engagement with the Welsh Government during the pandemic, I want to start first by looking at the meetings that you had with the Welsh Government. Is it right that, prior to the pandemic, you already had regularly established meetings with the Welsh Government, including quarterly meetings with Julie Morgan, Deputy Minister for Health And Social Services, and an annual meeting with the First Minister, Mark Drakeford?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You also had meetings with other ministers as and when the need arose?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of officials, your key link was Albert Heaney, the deputy director for health and social services, and you also met with the director for health and social services, Dr Andrew Goodall, every six months; is that right?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Turning to the beginning of the pandemic, you say in your witness statement that the Welsh Government was proactive at keeping you informed about the pandemic and the Welsh Government's response to it, and it gave you opportunities to raise issues with it at that time.

We've looked at the regular pattern of engagement you had with the Welsh Government prior to the pandemic. Did the frequency of that engagement increase or change in any way over the course of the pandemic?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: It did, yes. So from March the Welsh Government, so the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, Julie Morgan, wanted to reach out early on. She was expressing concern about the impact of the lockdown restrictions on older people, and particularly issues around isolation and loneliness, so she sought to engage in discussion very early with that.

I then had weekly meetings generally with the Deputy Minister for some months through 2020 and also had weekly meetings with the deputy director general for health and social services, Albert Heaney. The first few of those meetings were both myself and the Children's Commissioner.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In view of all of that, to what extent do you consider that you had sufficient opportunity to meet and engage with the Welsh Government in order to raise your concerns about the impact of the pandemic on older people?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So I felt at that stage that I had the opportunities that I needed through those two key people, through Julie Morgan and through Albert Heaney, and that meant that I was able to raise the issues that older people were raising with me and the concerns that I was seeing around, particularly early on, the issue about the rights of older people in terms of what was happening generally in society for older people at that time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I want to turn to look at some of the other structures that were in place during the pandemic. You explain in your statement that one of the more positive aspects of the Welsh Government's approach during the pandemic was how it set up structures and working groups to bring people together to share information on what was happening, pool ideas and expertise, and work together to find ways forward.

Please could you give a brief overview of those structures and working groups.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So there were quite a lot of working groups, and so it was either myself or members of my team that would attend those, sometimes in an observer capacity, given my independent role. They varied from groups which were primarily about sharing information and Welsh Government listening to issues that organisations were raising, to groups that were more about taking action and discussing how to take that action. So it varied, for example, from the vaccination programme board -- which was extremely effective, in my view, I was able to meet with the person leading that, a member of my team attended it, and we felt that issues that we raised were listened to and acted on -- and then wider meetings such as the Shadow Social Partnership Council, which is a very large meeting, essentially that was much more about being kept in touch with things.

So there was a range of different groups. Some of them lasted throughout the pandemic and some of them were shorter term.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And in general terms, how beneficial did you find those groups to be?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: It varied, I would say. It was always helpful to try to use those groups to stay on top of what was happening, things were changing so quickly and the impact on older people was so significant so early that it felt important to try to get into those groups and raise what was happening, as well as to get information that me and my team could then share with older people about what was happening.

I think, sometimes, some of the groups it wasn't so clear maybe what the terms of reference were and exactly to what extent they were decision-making or not, but most of them had some relevance and some use, I would say.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You called for the Welsh Government to create a new post of Chief Social Care Officer, which the Welsh Government did in fact introduce in June 2021. To what extent has that role, the existence of that role, benefitted your ability to advocate for the interests of older people?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I called for the role because this was part of my assessment that social care was not seen as on parity with the health service and needed to be, and that was about the status of the profession, the support for people working in domiciliary care and care homes and the need to much improve that recognition.

I felt having a post equivalent, if you like, to the Chief Medical Officer role or Chief Nursing Officer role would provide some of that. So Albert Heaney, who I was working with, when he was in his deputy director general role, was appointed to that role. I wouldn't say that had had a significant difference in terms of the discussions that we had or the actions that then flowed from those discussions.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

On a similar note, you've also made calls for a clear designation of older people in a minister's title. In your view, why would this be beneficial?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: My experience was that the Deputy Minister for Social Services was very attuned to the issues that I was raising, and took them seriously. What wasn't always clear was the extent to which that then fed through into other ministerial remits and into the Cabinet and into decision-making. And I feel -- I felt then and I feel now -- that it's important to have someone around the Cabinet table who has a responsibility to be raising issues that will impact on older people and to make sure that decision-making has that voice in the room.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you, Commissioner.

I want to turn now to discuss care homes and those living and working in the care sector.

I want to begin by looking at a letter that you sent to Julie Morgan, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, on 14 April 2020.

And this is INQ000184935.

You explain in this letter that this is further to a meeting that you had with Ms Morgan on 9 April 2020, and you explain that at that meeting you:

"... raised concerns about the situation for residents and staff in care homes, and the anxieties ... felt by their loved ones."

You go on to note that the Minister for Health and Social Services had announced that day that there had been confirmed or suspected cases in nearly a third of Wales' care homes.

You then ask the Welsh Government to take urgent action in a number of areas and I want to explore a few of those requests with you.

First, and it's the first bullet point there, you ask for the Welsh Government to take action to ensure that PPE is delivered effectively and consistently to care homes and that care homes have adequate supplies of infection control measures.

You wrote this letter on 14 April 2020, so at an early stage of the pandemic. At that point, what was your understanding of the accessibility of PPE in care homes?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So at that point I was having some dialogue with care home owners, I was hearing from care home staff and also family and friends of people living in care homes. What I was hearing in relation to PPE is that the supply was inconsistent. So some homes had the PPE that they needed, but others were really struggling to get it, trying to purchase it directly themselves, or struggling to secure it from the distribution mechanisms that were then in place.

So it was causing quite a lot of homes a lot of anxiety and stress about not having the PPE that they needed. And I think also they were concerned about, if they did have it, whether that supply would continue consistently for the time that they needed it.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You move on, in the second bullet point, to ask the Welsh Government to ensure that testing is available for residents showing symptoms of Covid-19. Again, similarly, at this stage of the pandemic what issues were you seeing in respect of testing?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Well, this was such a major issue, that older people were being discharged into care homes without -- from hospital without testing, and people within care homes were not being tested, and the feedback I was hearing and also seeing in relation, sadly, to the number of older people that were losing their lives in care homes, was that testing was an essential part of protecting people. And at that time there wasn't the testing that was being made available, and I felt it was urgent for improvements to be made in that in particular.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Then the third bullet point relates to access to NHS services and treatment and asks the Welsh Government to ensure that there are no blanket policies excluding care homes from receiving hospital treatment.

Again, if you could just talk about what evidence you were seeing at that point as to the implementation of those blanket policies.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So what I was hearing and what we knew is that health professionals had stopped visiting care homes, so GPs, for example, had largely stopped visiting care homes, so that was leaving care homes without that medical support that they needed, it meant that residents weren't seeing health professionals. But there were also some concerns that I was hearing about access to hospital treatment, so, for example, if someone fell ill in a care home whether they would be getting access to hospital treatment, and I was concerned whether there was any blanket policy in place. So I was really looking for assurance that that wasn't the case and that older people in care homes would not somehow be seen as less in need of healthcare or medical treatment because they were living in a care home.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

If we turn over the page to the final bullet point, you ask here that the Welsh Government ensures that information is captured and published about the levels of infections and deaths.

Were you aware of problems at this stage with the collection and sharing of data?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I think what -- what struck me really early on is that people who were dying in care homes from Covid-19, those deaths weren't even being counted, and I thought that was extraordinary and -- I found it then, still find it very distressing, actually, that that was the case. But more widely, there wasn't the data really about levels of infection and levels of people dying, and therefore it's much more difficult to, you know, assess what needs to be done, assess where the resource needs to go. And this issue of inadequate data covered a number of different areas throughout the pandemic, I would say, but was very stark at that time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just on --

**Lady Hallett**: I'm sorry to interrupt. When are you talking about -- as far as the people dying in care homes and their deaths not being counted, is that at the beginning?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Right at the beginning, yes, in sort of March/April time, yes.

**Lady Hallett**: So the figures would be skewed, because no one was --

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Yes, it was -- when the deaths from Covid-19 were starting to be published, initially people dying in care homes weren't included in that data.

**Lady Hallett**: Do you know why they weren't being counted? Was it because Covid didn't feature on the death certificate or ...?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I don't know, actually, I don't know why.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Sorry to interrupt.

**Ms Hitchman**: Not at all.

Aside from the sort of data collection point, what impact do you think that lack of inclusion of the deaths of older people in care homes had on the people that you represent?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Well, I think there was so much that was happening for older people at the time, and quite a lot of that was causing a lot of distress, and what I was hearing from older people was that they were -- some, not all, but some were feeling that their lives weren't valued, that they weren't important, and that -- those feelings were compounded by things like the issuing of the letter from a GP surgery in Bridgend about DNACPR, which caused huge distress. So there was a number of different things happened which, cumulatively, older people who were talking to me or talking to other older people which was being reported to me, there was certainly feeling that -- that sense of, yeah, just not being valued.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. And just for the transcript, DNACPR is Do Not Administer --

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Do Not Attempt.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do Not Attempt CPR, yes, thank you.

Your letter raises a number of issues across very disparate areas. In your view, to what extent could these issues have been foreseen by the Welsh Government prior to them arising in people's lived experiences?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I think a number of them could be foreseen. So if I take the issue of access to healthcare, then older people in care homes should have that access to healthcare, and issues about how that can continue should have been considered.

I would have thought issues about infection control and prevention were important to be considered as well.

There were also issues around people's access to loved ones, to visiting and how that could happen.

So of course there was a lot hitting the government at this time and a lot for it to consider, but given what we knew about Covid-19 and the vulnerability, therefore, of older people living in care homes, I felt that that should be such a high priority for action and for consideration of how to protect and support people living and working in care homes at the time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You called in your letter for the Welsh Government to announce a specific plan of action to minimise the spread of Covid-19 in care homes, based on the measures that you set out above. Please can you explain why you advocated for this action plan.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I did it for a number of reasons. I was struggling to see how the work to help older people living in care homes and those working in them, how that was being led and co-ordinated. So if I was struggling to see it, it was going to be even more difficult for people in care homes and families and friends to actually see what was happening. So part of it was to make clear to the public and particularly people living in care homes and those who had loved ones in care homes that Welsh Government recognised what was happening and was bringing all the different elements together to take action.

I also felt that there needed to be an urgency and focus, that I couldn't see at the time, and that's why I asked the Deputy Minister to sort of personally lead and set out an action plan so that it could drive faster progress, faster action to protect older people. I was worried that without that, the various different groups that there were, I couldn't see how that was going to drive the action that was needed as quickly as possible.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Just staying on that topic of an action plan, Ms Morgan responded to your letter on 21 April 2020.

If we could bring that up, please, it's INQ000184940.

In response to your request for an action plan, the letter said that Ms Morgan was:

"... not convinced that an additional plan of action over and above those arrangements ..."

And she sets out some other arrangements above:

"... will add value here but we will certainly report on progress via the Social care Sub-group."

What was your view as to the adequacy of that response?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I thought it was inadequate, and I was angered actually by the notion that working on an action plan, producing an action plan, bringing the work together, would add no value, at a time when people were dying in care homes where families were distraught. I just thought the response was inadequate.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I want to turn now to look at the extent to which the concerns that you set out in your earlier letter were addressed and actioned in the months that followed.

If we could, please, have up on screen INQ000181725.

This is a report by you titled "Care Home Voices: A snapshot of life in care homes in Wales during Covid-19", and I would just like to take you through a few parts of this report.

The report was based on over 120 responses received between 14 May and 5 June 2020; is that right?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So if we turn to page 7, first of all, this section is titled "Keeping care homes safe", and towards the bottom of the page you state as:

"In early April, the Welsh Government announced it had procured 5 million 'pieces' of PPE that would be distributed to local authorities throughout Wales, which I welcomed, and some care home managers reported that they had managed to source consistent supplies of PPE, with support from the wider 'system', and had remained well stocked."

If we then turn over the page to page 8, you state here:

"Other responses, however, highlighted the difficulties and frustrations that [care] homes had faced in trying to access PPE, and the length of time it took to obtain this vital equipment."

Is it fair to say, then, that by June 2020, the date that you wrote this report, access to PPE was patchy with some care homes able to access it more readily than others?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Yes, I think that is fair, based on what I was hearing. So I wasn't hearing from everybody but, based on what I was hearing, my sense was that there had been improvements but it was still patchy.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Turning now to page 10, which concerns testing, you note at the top that the Welsh Government's testing policy was heavily scrutinised and, following calls from yourself and others, testing was made available to all care home residents and staff. However, it appears from your report that, from the information you were hearing, access to testing was not quite that easy. You state later on this page that:

"Responses also indicated that despite changes in testing policy, homes still experienced difficulties in accessing testing for residents and staff."

So, again, would it be fair to say that there was a mixed picture from the information you were hearing about the efficacy of that change in policy?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Yes, there was, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What effect did that have on the older people for whom you advocate?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: It was an incredibly worrying time for people in care homes and I think actually the quote at the top of the page says it all, about the gentleman who said, you know, "why wasn't Joyce important enough to have a test". It felt very personal, of course, to people who were at risk who were seeing, you know, other residents fall ill and die, who were seeing loved ones die, that the testing just wasn't -- wasn't there consistently or quickly enough.

And it created a lot of anxiety for people in care homes. For the staff as well, so staff reported feeling scared about being at work. And of course for family and friends, who often have gone through a very emotional process when a loved one moves into a care home, and were now distant from them and worried about what was happening.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Relatedly, to what extent were changes made to the capture of data, going back to the point we discussed earlier about inclusion of the deaths of those in care homes?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So the data did improve, and I can't recall when the data changed, but it did change, and we would then see every week how many older people were dying as a result of Covid in care homes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I just want to look at one further section of this report, which relates to a topic that you did not raise in your letter to Ms Morgan, but which does feature heavily in your witness statement, and that's connection with loved ones.

If we could turn to page 15, you note at the top of this page that many older people had not seen their family and friends at all for prolonged periods and had concerns about the impact that lockdown could be having on their wellbeing.

If we turn over the page to page 16, there is a slightly more positive point that you note, which is that:

"On the whole, however, the responses we received indicate that people were able to stay connected with their loved ones in care homes, with care home staff supporting residents to do video calls or share updates online via email or Facebook."

In your view, to what extent was the social impact of lockdown on older people, whether in the care sector or elsewhere, sufficiently considered by the Welsh Government in its decision-making?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I think in the decision-making that the Deputy Minister for Social Services, Julie Morgan, was making, I think she did consider it, so she was very attuned, I think, to the emotional impact, had raised issues with me early in the pandemic.

What I'm less clear about and certain about is the extent to which Welsh Government more generally considered -- considered that. And in relation specifically to visiting, this was partly about Welsh Government but it was also partly about Public Health Wales and their advice on visiting, for example.

So there were a number of different organisations, different bodies, who had a role in these things. But overall I think I felt that some of the impacts on older people, particularly in relation actually to their mental health, were not always well understood or taken account of. I think there was a better recognition of physical health but maybe not so much of the levels of anxiety and depression and stress that older people were experiencing.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Just finally on this report, I'd like to turn to your conclusions at page 22. I won't take you through all of this, but just to go through it reasonably quickly, you note in the third paragraph that there was a significant disconnect between what was being promised at policy level and what was being delivered on the ground. Then you go on to state in the fourth paragraph that many of the issues and challenges that had been shared with you could have potentially been avoided through more effective planning and engagement with care homes at an earlier stage and the provision of clear practical information and guidance.

Then just over the page at page 23, you provide various suggestions of immediate actions that could be taken, and one of those I would like to pick up on, which is the Welsh Government action plan for care homes. This is something for which you had been calling, as we've been through, from as early as April 2020, as we have just seen.

At this point, several months into the pandemic, why did you think that this remained so important?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Because ... because people living in care homes, those working in care homes and those who had loved ones in care homes were still going through agonies in terms of what was happening, and I still felt that there was more that needed to be done. There needed to be, you know, clear co-ordination on that.

And two of the things I think would have been helpful is being clear about accountabilities, who was doing what in relation to the decisions, and clearer about timescales as well. Some of the feedback I had from older people that stuck with me was, you know, not being able to see the light at the end of the tunnel: "When could this change? When might we be able to see people? When might we be able to go out from the home again?" And I felt it would also, importantly, indicate to older people and their families the seriousness with which Welsh Government was taking the situation.

And finally, the issue about consistent and clear information, so people working in care homes, particularly managers, were saying they were still getting a lot of different guidance and changes and that was very difficult for them to manage and deal with.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

An action plan was eventually published on 30 July 2020. In the interests of time, we won't turn to that plan now, but you explain in your statement that you were disappointed that it had taken so long for that plan to be developed and announced. As we've already discussed, Ms Morgan initially rejected your proposal, as it was felt that it would add no value. In your view, did that action plan have the value that you expected it to have when it was implemented?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I think it would have had greater value had it been done earlier, and it was -- I was pleased that they had published it. It wasn't as comprehensive and clear as maybe I would have liked in relation to those two issues of accountability and timescales, but it was a step forward, and it felt an important step forward at the time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We have been through a handful of examples of you providing your views to the Welsh Government. To what extent did the Welsh Government proactively solicit your input as to the risks that would be faced by care home residents?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: It was a topic of discussion in my regular meetings. It wasn't always easy to say who initiated that discussion, but I would say that the Deputy Minister would, on an ongoing basis, be keen to hear feedback from me about what older people were experiencing.

We discussed the Care Home Voices report, and she was keen to discuss that, and to hear about what people were experiencing in care homes at that time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I want to turn now to look at one of several reports that you produced during the pandemic, the Leave no-one behind report.

If we could have that up, it's INQ000184908.

This report was based on information and experience -- sorry, information, experiences and ideas captured at 16 online engagement sessions that you had held with older people and those who work with and support they were across Wales; is that right?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we could turn in page 10, please, we can see a quotation from an older person:

"We are all feeling that if we do get ill, as older people, whether we will get the treatment that we deserve, or if we would be seen as 'dying soon', and if that would result in poorer treatment."

To what extent was that a common theme in your interactions with older people during the pandemic?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: It did come up quite a lot. I think the issue I touched on earlier about Do Not Attempt CPR, and particularly that letter, which of course got a lot of publicity -- we heard from other older people who --

**Lady Hallett**: Could you tell me about the letter? I'm terribly sorry.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Sorry.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry, no, no, please just tell me about the letter.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So this was the letter that came out from a GP surgery, I think in very early April, that was sent out to a number of its older patients and people living with frailty, saying that it wanted to complete a Do Not Attempt CPR form for them, and it went on to say that if they were, fell ill or needed treatment, essentially that they shouldn't call 999. And it also went on to say that scarce resources would be directed to those who were young and fit and more able to benefit.

So it very starkly set out how older people were being viewed at that time.

I of course raised that, and there was an apology issued by the surgery, but, you know, that stayed with people, that feeling stayed with people.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm not surprised.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: And when that happened, my advice and assistance team then got quite a lot of calls from older people and their families saying, "Actually we've seen that our loved one has a Do Not Attempt CPR form, but we knew nothing about it", and my concern then was that it really broke the trust that some older people had with the NHS, and this quote speaks to that, really, that they felt that maybe they wouldn't get the treatment that they needed.

And the other thing that was happening at the same time was that the messaging about protect the NHS I think was having a damaging effect on some older people as well, who felt that they shouldn't approach even when they were ill, so that it deterred them from seeking help when I think they should have done. And all these -- all of these things people were experiencing, and I think particularly for people living on their own, it was frightening.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry to interrupt.

**Ms Hitchman**: Just to pick up on that point you raise, Commissioner, about dissuading older people from utilising the NHS, if we could turn to page 12, please, and reference is made here to one of the earlier steps taken by the Welsh Government in response to the first wave, and it says at the top:

"All 'non-urgent' surgery and outpatient appointments were suspended in March and many older people, afraid of the risk of contracting Covid-19, have stayed away from GP surgeries and hospitals. This means that many older people throughout Wales will not have been able to access the healthcare services and support they need."

To what extent do you believe that the impact of harms from non-Covid illnesses and health-related problems were considered in the early days of the pandemic?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: It's difficult for me to assess that, really, but the issue of the way in which communications were done and the potential deterrent effect of that I don't think was considered, and throughout the pandemic one of the issues I raised with Welsh Government and others was the importance of communicating appropriately with older people, who I think were more likely to deter themselves from approaching the NHS and elsewhere for help, and I actually wanted messages that would encourage people to come forward if they needed help and support. So I think there wasn't probably as much recognition as there needed to be of that impact.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Just to pick up on the point you've raised about communication with older people, if we could turn to page 22, please, there's a quotation here from an older person which reads:

"So many feel disconnected, mainly because so many don't use social media. As many times as my Group have been shown even basic use of tablets, phones, they don't feel confident to use them when alone. This of course makes many feel discriminated against as they don't get vital information."

The topic of disconnection and lack of communication is one that recurs throughout your witness statement, and we've already touched upon connection with loved ones, but I want to look now at access to information, including public health information.

You explain in your witness statement that around a third of those over the age of 75 were not online. How accessible was the messaging about the pandemic to this group?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Well, people who were not online, it was much, much more difficult, not just to get information but to check out whether that was the correct information. We all often, if we are online, will use different search engines to verify information. If you're not, it's very difficult to check it out.

There was also a move very quickly by public bodies to do more through online media, information, advice, information about how to contact the health service, all of that, and I don't think there was at that time a sufficient recognition of the challenges if you were not online.

It made other forms of communication particularly important. So, for example, the daily press conferences that Welsh Government was having, the use of television and radio in terms of media, and one of the reasons why I went on the media quite a few times was to help in getting that information out to older people.

But it was very, very difficult if you were not online to stay in touch with what was happening, to find out more information or to know how to navigate what was a rapidly changing world.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Finally, I want to look very briefly at your co-operation with the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

Early in the pandemic, you had established an informal UK network of older people's organisations which was for leaders of older people's organisations across the UK; is that right?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The network wrote to the chief executive of the EHRC on 16 April 2020 setting out various concerns about the issues affecting older people. We can't look at all of your engagement with the EHRC today, but would it be fair to say that you and the EHRC worked closely together during the pandemic to address those points?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So I worked closely with the EHRC in Wales, very closely, particularly from sort of late April, May onwards 2020. In relation to EHRC that has the remit across Great Britain, we had some engagement early on. Myself and the other leaders of organisations across the UK, older people's organisations, really wanted the EHRC to take further action because of the threats that we were seeing to older people's rights, and they did issue a helpful statement, but at the GB level, if I could put it like that, they weren't undertaking so much action. Within Wales I was able to work very closely with the head of EHRC Wales.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You and the head of the EHRC in Wales agreed an unpublished joint summary of the work you had undertaken to scrutinise the Welsh Government between April and December 2020. That summary is in your witness statement at paragraph 11.54.

We won't go through all of these now, but just to pick up on the first one, you say that:

"There were shortcomings in the Welsh Government's decision-making processes with regards to equality and human rights considerations during the first months of the pandemic. This includes an absence of Equality Impact Assessments as legally required by the Public Sector Equality Duty."

Could you briefly speak to what those shortcomings were?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Together with the EHRC, we wanted to assess whether Welsh Government was undertaking equality impact assessments and effectively considering the issues of the rights of older people. We asked for evidence to that effect, and the evidence that we received in early November didn't demonstrate to us that those equality impact assessments were being carried out. The rationale given was that, at that time, they were having to make very fast decisions and therefore it wasn't always possible in every case to carry out equality impact assessments.

But of great concern to me was that that information went on to say that intuitively they knew the action that was needed, and I was particularly concerned that they were relying on intuition rather than actually assessing what the impact would be on older people of course but on all groups with protected characteristics.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Turning finally to the future, you've set out in your statement a host of lessons learned and recommendations, and we've touched on some of these already today in your evidence. I want to just focus on one area that you raise in your statement, which is health and social care, and I wonder if you could conclude by talking briefly about what actions could be taken, whether by the Welsh Government or other public bodies, to protect and promote older people's rights in the event of a future pandemic.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So there had been some work under way, first of all, over the last couple of years in particular, and I think some of the policy direction is correct. So, for example, within health policy care closer to home, a focus on supporting people living with frailty. On -- in relation to social care, there has been welcome measures taken to improve the wages of people working in social care, to improve data collection.

Overall, however, I still feel that there isn't an adequate focus on enabling us all to age well and healthily, on providing support in relation to mental health support and rehabilitation support for older people. And many older people are still living with the consequences of the pandemic, for their physical and mental health, the isolation that they've experienced, and also, following the pandemic, the impact of the cost of living crisis and the pressures on health and care. So what I'm hearing from older people is actually some of them are facing their toughest times now.

**Ms Hitchman**: Thank you, Commissioner.

My Lady, I have no further questions.

**Lady Hallett**: Right. I think we do have some Rule 10 questions. Who is it? Oh, it's you, Mr Straw, I'm so sorry. I was looking at Ms Gowman, I wondered if it was her.

Mr Straw.

Questions From Mr Straw KC

**Mr Straw**: Thank you.

Good afternoon, Commissioner, I represent John's Campaign and Care Rights UK.

You mentioned earlier that because of the known vulnerability of people in care homes to Covid they should have been a high priority to the Welsh Government.

Is it your view that they were not given a sufficiently high priority?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: It is my view, yes, and that's why I wanted to see that action plan, to make sure that they were given the priority that they needed.

**Mr Straw KC**: Your reports, your position paper on care homes and your witness statement draw attention to the serious harm of restrictions on visits to people needing care, and you've said that initial decisions on visiting did not take into account the harm that lack of visits caused. Is that correct?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Yes, that's correct.

**Mr Straw KC**: You also recommended that the restrictions should be eased and you set out how that could or should be done, for example, making a family member a designated visitor with key worker status so that they can access prior testing, PPE and so on.

Did you raise those concerns and make those recommendations to the Welsh Government?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Yes. So, I was able to do that both in my meetings with the Deputy Minister for Social Services, we discussed visiting a lot over a number of months, and then myself initially and then members of my team were part of the group of different organisations that was working to improve access into care homes and to improve visiting arrangements in care homes.

**Mr Straw KC**: Now, we know that bans on visits were maintained for much of the time until May 2021, and considerable restrictions remained thereafter. Do you consider that core decision-makers made prompt and appropriate changes in response to the concerns that you'd been raising?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I think it varied throughout that time, and the issue -- there was part of an issue about making prompt decisions but making sure the implementation would work.

So if I could explain what I mean by that, if guidance suddenly changed and issued but people who had to implement that guidance hadn't fed into it, made sure it would work, then it was unlikely to have had the impact that it wanted. So I think there was a very real tension between moving quickly in order to enable safe visiting and doing it in a way that would mean every care home would be enabling safe visiting.

**Mr Straw KC**: To take a specific example, you've noted that the suspension of outdoor visits in September 2020 --

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Yes.

**Mr Straw KC**: -- may have been a disproportionate response which would have been very damaging. Did you consider that core decision-makers had properly taken into account the concerns that you had raised earlier than that about restrictions on visits?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So, as I said, it was definitely an ongoing discussion that was happening with the Deputy Minister, and I would say she did understand that.

I think part of the challenge on visiting was it wasn't always clear who the key decision-makers were, particularly between Welsh Government, Public Health Wales and then the local teams that were making those decisions and care homes. And that issue of fragmentation and lack of clarity about where the decisions lay was deeply frustrating but also, I think, did delay progress on enabling safe visiting.

**Mr Straw KC**: Part of your Care Homes Voices report was read out earlier, where you indicated that there was a significant disconnect between what government discussed and what it delivered. That report also noted you had serious concerns that older people's rights weren't being sufficiently protected. Could you explain in more detail what you meant by that.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So in relation to older people's rights fundamentally, right to life and right to private and family life, so the ability to maintain those connections with the people that mattered most, so that was a key concern. Could you repeat the first part of your question, please?

**Mr Straw KC**: Yes. So there were perhaps two aspects to the care home voices report: one, this disconnect --

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Yes.

**Mr Straw KC**: -- between what government discussed and what it did on the ground; and then the second, about older people's rights.

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I think, to the first point, it was an issue of implementation. So when the policy changed or was announced there was a lot of work that needed to happen in terms of implementing that. That was by, you know, individual care homes. It was important to get the information out to older people and families and friends who wanted to visit. So sometimes there was a gap between a policy announcement to say "This is now how visiting should be" and what families and friends were experiencing. And that may also have been because there were local outbreaks that meant that homes were having to isolate or reduce visiting again. So that's why it was a very mixed picture.

One of the things I did as a result of that was to invite people to get in touch with me if they were facing those difficulties in their local engagement so that I could look to see whether this was something that was just, you know, one home maybe for a particular reason or whether systemically things weren't moving as quickly as they should have been.

**Mr Straw KC**: Final issue, at paragraph 3.26 of your statement you draw attention to "the fact that social workers were not being recognised as key workers in the same way as NHS workers", and earlier in your questions you raised the lack of parity between social care and the health service. In what ways was there a lack of parity between social care and the health service?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: Well, I felt that social care was definitely seen as secondary to the health service, in a number of different ways. If you look at the way in which -- you know, the wage levels in relation to health and social care, for example, the way in which society talks about social care, it doesn't feature in the way that people talk about the NHS, the huge focus on hospitals, understandably, but I think it meant that care homes were sometimes viewed as places primarily there to accept people who were being discharged from hospital rather than as people's homes.

**Mr Straw**: Thank you very much, those are all my questions.

**Lady Hallett**: Now it's Ms Gowman.

Thank you, Mr Straw.

Questions From Ms Gowman

**Ms Gowman**: I ask questions on behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru.

You agreed in response to questions from Ms Hitchman that certain issues which arose during the pandemic could have been foreseen by the Welsh Government prior to them arising in lived experience. We know that the threat of a widespread respiratory virus was emerging in January and February 2020. Do you agree that decision-makers responsible for responding should have recognised at that very early stage that older people were particularly vulnerable to what might be coming?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: So I wasn't engaged on this issue with Welsh Government in January and February, they weren't raising it with me, so I think that indicated that at that time maybe they weren't giving it that focus. They started to engage with me on the issue, I think, in March.

**Ms Gowman**: I think that perhaps answers my next question, but it's right, isn't it, that a respiratory virus, to follow up on what you say, would have impacted disproportionately on the older generation; do you agree with that?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I'm not a medic, but from what I know, yes, I agree with that.

**Ms Gowman**: So some of the factors that should have been featuring in decision-making at that point, in January and February, should have included such things as the elderly's vulnerability to respiratory infection, comorbidities and dependence on health and social care, and the potential for unfair rationing of services; do you agree?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I agree in relation to older people with comorbidity, so this is a major thing that can happen as we get -- as we age, that we can get a number of different conditions that can make us vulnerable. And I would also highlight issues around isolation and need for care and support.

And I'd probably add in, actually, the vast numbers of older people who are unpaid carers, so caring for a loved one, perhaps for a partner with dementia, for example, where they were very, very reliant on health and care but also quite vulnerable themselves.

**Ms Gowman**: And given the Welsh Government knew it was a respiratory virus, should -- I would suggest, and I think you'd agree, have anticipated the factors that you've just outlined -- it -- should the engagement of Welsh Government with you have come prior to March 2020?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I think -- if I look back I think it would have been helpful to have had earlier discussions. I think me and my team, like everyone else, was beginning to see what was happening in Europe, particularly in Italy, and we were at that time considering what might this mean. I -- as I said earlier, I very much welcomed the rapid engagement that started from March, but if I look back, on reflection, it probably would have been helpful if that had happened earlier.

**Ms Gowman**: Am I right in saying that the engagement in March came after the first lockdown was announced?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I'm afraid I can't recall.

**Ms Gowman**: My second topic and my last topic is support given to the elderly in respect of bereavement. Did your work as the Older People's Commissioner for Wales include consideration of the position of older people suffering bereavement, for example after the loss of their spouse or partner in the pandemic?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: It wasn't a focus of my work at that time. We were trying to deal with a huge amount of different issues that were impacting on older people, and I knew that organisations such as Marie Curie and others were doing very good work on this. We of course dealt with individual issues that came forward, but it wasn't something that I had capacity to cover.

**Ms Gowman**: Were you aware of any steps taken by the Welsh Government and its partner agencies to explore what further support could be given to older people in that situation, if you didn't have capacity yourself?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I don't recall. I know -- I think there was work on bereavement, there was certainly work going on at the UK level that I was hearing about, but I just can't recall. I don't know what was happening in Wales at that time.

**Ms Gowman**: Would you have expected to have been aware if there was a large body of work being done on that issue?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I think if there had have been a large body of work I might have been aware, but there was a lot -- a lot -- happening, so I wouldn't -- I wouldn't assert that.

**Ms Gowman**: And if you weren't aware, does that suggest that perhaps any work that was being done was either non-existent or inadequate?

**Ms Helena Herklots**: I don't -- I don't know.

**Ms Gowman**: Thank you. Those are my questions.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Gowman. I liked your question at the end, slipping in the leading question.

**Ms Gowman**: Yes, my Lady, it was tacked on --

**Lady Hallett**: No, you're perfectly entitled to, there's no criticism.

**Ms Gowman**: It was tacked on to the end of the permitted questions, but I accept that --

**Lady Hallett**: No, that's fine.

**Ms Gowman**: -- it was slightly cheeky. Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: No, it's fine.

Thank you very much indeed, I'm extremely grateful for your help. If I may say so, as an outsider, the older people of Wales are lucky to have you as their commissioner.

**The Witness**: Well, can I just thank my team as well and put that on record. Thank you.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: Right, shall we break now? I shall return at 3.15.

*(3.01 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(3.15 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, Ms Cowen.

**Ms Cowen**: My Lady, may I please call Professor Sally Holland.
