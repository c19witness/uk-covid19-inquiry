*PROFESSOR EMMANUEL OGBONNA (sworn).*

Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry for Module 2B

**Mr Poole**: Professor, thank you for attending today and assisting the Inquiry. Whilst you're giving your evidence, if you can please make sure that you keep your voice up, so that we can hear you, but also so that your evidence can be recorded and that you speak as slowly as you can so that again your evidence can be recorded. If I ask you anything that isn't clear, please ask me to repeat it.

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Okay.

**Lead 2B**: Now, you were asked by the Inquiry to provide a witness statement addressing the work that you carried out as part of the First Minister's Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Covid-19 Advisory Group, and we can see your witness statement on the screen. You signed that statement on 8 October 2023. Are the contents of that statement true to the best of your knowledge and belief?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: They are.

**Lead 2B**: Now, we'll come back to your statement and your work with the First Minister's advisory group in due course. Could we start, though, with a few questions about yourself.

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Okay.

**Lead 2B**: You are a professor of management and organisation at Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I am.

**Lead 2B**: You joined Cardiff Business School as a lecturer, I think, in 1990, and were appointed to your present professorial position in 2002; is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: It is.

**Lead 2B**: I understand that your research cuts across the fields of organisation studies, strategy, marketing and human resource management?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: They do.

**Lead 2B**: And your recent research interests have been in the areas of organisational culture, equality, diversity and inclusion and exploring the position of black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in the labour market; is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: It is.

**Lead 2B**: I think I'm right in saying that you're also a trustee and vice-chair of the Race Council Cymru?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes, I am.

**Lead 2B**: Can we please briefly explain what the Race Council Cymru is and also your role within it.

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Thank you. Race Council Cymru is one of the major, I would say, charities that look after the interests of black and minority ethnic people in Wales. Race Council is also the leading charity that looks after the Black Lives Matter movement and also that looks after the Windrush elders, the Windrush community that have been so badly dealt with by the state. Race Council Cymru is taking after looking after their affairs in Wales.

**Lead 2B**: Am I right that Race Council Cymru, it started in 2010 as a collection of grassroots community groups, but now it is the overarching umbrella body that brings together a range of organisations to combat racial prejudice, discrimination, harassment, victimisation, abuse?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes, it is.

**Lead 2B**: It was in your capacity as a member of Race Council Cymru that you joined with others and wrote to Dr Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, in April 2020, expressing concerns about the disproportionate impact that the pandemic was having on people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds; is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: We can see a copy of that letter, it's INQ000222867. We can see that at the top right it's dated 14 April. It is marked "For the Urgent Attention of ... Dr ... Atherton".

If we can go to page 2, we can see that the letter is signed off by Judge Ray Singh CBE, who is the chairperson of Race Council Cymru.

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: And he has also provided a witness statement to this Inquiry. Then, below his name, we can see the list of Race Council trustees and your name is at the top of that list.

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: We can, please, go back to the first page and look at the first paragraph on page 1.

The letter references in that first paragraph the report from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre, which suggested that 34% of critical care patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.

As the letter goes on to say, the first ten doctors to die from Covid-19 were from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, and a disproportionate number of nurses and other healthcare workers that have lost their lives have also been from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.

Then if we zoom out, the letter goes on to request urgent action to be taken to protect the lives and wellbeing of black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in Wales.

As well as that letter, written on behalf of Race Council Cymru, are you also aware that Professor Singhal, in her capacity as the chair of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, wrote to Dr Atherton and Dr Andrew Goodall, who at the time was the chief executive of NHS Wales, raising similar concerns?

If we could, please, have a copy of Professor Singhal's letter -- thank you -- it's INQ000222868.

This is dated a few days later, so this is 17 April 2020.

If we can look, please, at page 2 of that letter, the words in bold, it calls for urgent action, in particular it calls for:

"... employers to urgently carry out a stratified risk assessment so that [the] Healthcare workers on the frontline of tackling the pandemic are not unnecessarily put in harm's way."

Thank you.

As regards the response to the Race Council's letter, your co-authored letter, you say in your witness statement that the First Minister acted promptly, and on 29 April, so that's two weeks after receipt of the letter, he established the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Covid-19 Advisory Group to look into the issues that had been raised in that letter and Professor Singhal's letter, and to recommend the necessary courses of action to alleviate those problems?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: Do you think it should have taken letters like yours and Professor Singhal's, or do you think that the Welsh Government ought to have recognised the disproportionate impact of Covid for themselves and taken earlier action?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: My understanding was that at the time the Welsh Government and people within it were themselves becoming as concerned and that at the time our letter was written they had come to the same realisation and were thinking of what to do. That was my understanding at the time.

**Lead 2B**: Judge Singh was invited to chair the First Minister's advisory group.

If we could, please, have on screen INQ000267870.

These are the terms of reference for that advisory group. In the first paragraph, the terms of reference identify the concerns that Race Council Cymru had identified in the letter we've looked at, namely the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, "with consequent adverse health outcomes".

Then if we can just zoom out, the group -- the aims of the group are then set out in those four bullet points. So namely to advise the Welsh Government specifically on:

"• Any effective measures that could be put in place to quantify and evaluate risks;

"• Any avoidable harms and effective risk assessment measures;

"• Possible interventions and system remedies; and

"• Any other issues required by Ministers."

Now, as you say in your statement, the group decided that two subgroups were required to explore, first, the socioeconomic issues that were implicated, and, second, the health and social care issues that were involved.

If we can please, in this document, look at page 3 of the terms of reference, these are the terms of reference for the scientific, or risk assessment, subgroup. Now, that subgroup was co-chaired by Professor Singhal and Helen Arthur; is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: And that was specifically tasked to come up with a risk assessment tool. If we could please look at page 5 of this document, these are the terms of reference for the socioeconomic subgroup --

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: -- which you were invited to chair; correct?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: If we just look at that list of deliverables, including at point 2:

"Propose short term options to minimise any exacerbation of inequalities identified."

Would it be right, Professor, to say that the work of both subgroups was carried out at pace?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: And commendably your socioeconomic subgroup managed to produce a detailed report in June 2022 --

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: 2020.

**Lead 2B**: 2020, sorry. That's to say, within two months of being commissioned to produce a report?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: And I think the risk assessment subgroup also produced a risk assessment tool and presented that to the Welsh Government by mid-May 2020?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: I'd like to first look at the work of your socioeconomic subgroup, if I may.

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: We can see the report, certainly the first page of the report -- it's INQ000068463, and if we could, please, go to page 29 of that document -- we see there the membership of your subgroup. So we can see that the group included representation from black, Asian and minority ethnic NHS care and care workers, Public Health Wales, NHS Wales health boards and trusts, the Equality and Human Rights Commission in Wales, as well as Welsh Government officials; is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: Before we look at the themes covered by the report and the recommendations that your group made, I'd like to just understand a bit about the methodology that you employed.

How did you gather the data that informed your report?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Okay, so because we didn't have the type of time that one may have required to conduct your regular research, what we did was to rely extensively on evidence that was already published, so evidence on the disproportionate outcomes already -- that are already known, in terms of employment, in housing and other areas.

We especially relied on the report by the EHRC talking about Wales and the fairness within Wales. But more importantly we relied on people: we gathered evidence from around 400 people from grassroots communities, whom we invited to participate in Zoom sessions and the like, and we were able to have these sessions practically on a daily basis at the time, from memory, you know, inviting different types of people from grassroots ethnic minority communities to come in and talk to us about what was happening to them. So we relied on that lived experience of racism that, in a sense, was identified by those people extensively in our report.

**Lead 2B**: I think I'm right, aren't I, that a deputy minister attended some of your meetings, and that would have been Jane Hutt?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: In general terms, how would you describe the Welsh Government's engagement with your group?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: The Welsh Government was very engaged. The Deputy Minister and Chief Whip at the time, Jane Hutt, attended -- I remember attending many, if not most of, the Zoom calls that we had, and she was able to identify what I describe in my witness statement as some "quick wins". So people would be talking about their experiences and then she would instruct civil servants to look into those and were -- and in a sense was able to remedy some of the problems that were happening on the ground. So, for example, there were cases where people were saying that they weren't being given appropriate PPE in their respective hospitals, and they attributed that to their race and ethnicity, and it was then possible for the Deputy Minister to instruct the senior civil servants that were on the calls as well, you know, to investigate those and to do something about that.

There was also another case I remember of people who were saying that they were being forced to work for so many hours to be able to pay for their visas, because of the extra imposition on health and social care workers by the immigration authorities, the Home Office, that the amount of money that they needed to pay to be able to have their visas extended, and that that was exposing them to additional risks. And I know that, because those rules were not devolved to the Welsh Government, the Deputy Minister and Chief Whip was able to negotiate -- to at least to instruct officials to discuss the possibilities of removing those levies, extra levies on people, with the government in Westminster. I don't know how successful that was, but in the end that became something that the Prime Minister announced, that those levies were removed.

**Lead 2B**: So these are issues that are being identified in meetings --

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yeah.

**Lead 2B**: -- that the Welsh Government are attending?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: And not necessarily waiting for the production of your report in June --

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: -- but these are being actioned whilst that report is still being worked on --

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: -- is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes, yes.

**Lead 2B**: Now, a number of things emerged from the report prepared by your group and I don't propose to discuss all of them, I'd just like to discuss some of the key things and then in so doing look at the recommendations that your group makes and then look at the response of the Welsh Government.

I'd like to start with ethnicity data, or I probably should say lack of ethnicity data.

Now, we don't need to go to the page of your report, but it's paragraph 26, it starts with the sentence:

"Data on ethnicity across all health and social care services and many other public services is poor."

Is this something that you found to be a particular problem in Wales?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: And one area of concern that you identified is that data on ethnicity is not recorded on death certificates in England and Wales, and you say in the report the recording of births and deaths is a reserved matter for the UK Government.

Can you briefly just explain why that was an issue that you specifically identify?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I think if you are looking to have an accurate statistic on death rates, it would be useful to have the ethnicity recorded. If you don't have the ethnicity recorded, you may actually not be accurate in the data that is being put out. So we may not even know how bad the problem we're dealing with was.

**Lead 2B**: Having identified the issue, are you able to say what steps the Welsh Government has taken to address that issue, it being, as you identify, a reserved matter for the UK Government?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I know that there, again, this was one of the issues that was taken up and there were discussions with the relevant departments at the Home Office. I don't -- and I know that there was a group that was looking into that specifically, but I don't know the outcome of that.

**Lady Hallett**: Professor, I think -- I heard about this in a previous module -- I think it's not straightforward, is it? I can see the sense in what you're saying, if you want to gather data, but I think I heard from another witness in another module that it's not entirely straightforward recording ethnicity on death certificates.

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: It's very difficult, my Lady, because, for whatever reason, not everybody feels comfortable, and -- and ethnicity and race are sociological concepts, modern day, and biological in that sense, so it's not a straightforward thing. But I think one of the reasons it's not straightforward, it's also because people are not always certain about what the data will be used for, so they want to shy away from them. But I do agree that they're not.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Mr Poole**: Another recommendation -- so we're still on the question of ethnicity data -- that you make in this area is linking databases to provide better data on different types of mortality, so disaggregated by different protected characteristics, including ethnicity.

If we can just look at the Welsh Government response to your report, so it's INQ000285930.

So as we see on that first page of the response, first published 24 September 2020 and then updated on 30 December.

If we can, please, look at page 13 of this report.

This is a section of the response dealing with ethnicity data and the Welsh Government says that it agrees that:

"... it is important to use innovative techniques including data linking to help improve the quality of data available on the population disaggregated by different characteristics."

And then they say they'll:

"... explore ways to link data on outcomes to enable this."

And to that end will use the Administrative Data Research Unit and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank.

Are you aware of that work, Professor?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: There was a group of people that were dedicated to looking at this area of work, you had population specialists that were doing that, and they -- they did report to some of the meetings, some of which I attended, some that I did not. So I was aware that there was a group looking into this at the time.

**Lead 2B**: Are you satisfied with the Welsh Government's response to the concerns about ethnicity data that your report identifies, or is there more that you would like to be done?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I would say that it is an ongoing thing and that the groups that were identified that were looking into it at the time were -- when I spoke to some of them, I got the impression that they were positive about what the outcome would be in the end, but I have to say I haven't been in contact since then, so I don't know.

**Mr Poole**: My Lady, if that's an appropriate moment for a break.

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, of course.

I hope you were warned, Professor, we take a break regularly for the benefit of the stenographer and everybody else, so I shall return at 11.30.

*(11.14 am)*

*(A short break)*

*(11.30 am)*

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Poole.

**Mr Poole**: Professor, another key theme of your report is the significantly higher risk of death involving Covid amongst those of non-white ethnicity. I don't need you to pull this up, but paragraph 33 of your report identifies that the risk of Covid-related death in males and females of black ethnicity is 1.9 times higher than those with white ethnicity and the risk of Covid-related death for men of Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnicity is 1.8 times higher than white males.

You go on at paragraph 34 of the report to say that there is a considerable level of anxiety amongst employees about the risks of Covid-19 and the potential additional risk for black, Asian and minority ethnic workers as an at-risk group, and the report explains how this is being addressed by the risk assessment tool that was developed by the risk assessment subgroup.

Now, as we touched on earlier, Professor Singhal's subgroup was specifically tasked with coming up with a risk assessment tool for frontline health and social care workers, and I understand that you were not involved with the work that was done in that area. I would, though, like to ask you some questions, if I may, about the risk assessment tool.

Now, Professor Singhal has produced a witness statement to this module.

If we could, please, see that, it is INQ000251934.

At page 3, paragraph 6, Professor Singhal describes there the first meeting of the risk assessment subgroup that took place on 5 May 2020, and then we see in that table Professor Singhal sets out the draft risk assessment tool.

Now, the way the tool works, as we can see, is that it identifies risk factors such as age, sex and comorbidities, which includes ethnicity, and allocates each of those a score, and then once a person has added up their score they can see their own risk.

If we can go over the page to page 4, we can see: a score of 0-3, low risk; score of 4-6, high risk; and a score of 7 or more, very high risk.

Then the person concerned can identify the actions that they should take.

So, for example, as we see in that table, those at low risk should continue to work following all recommended hygiene and social distancing measures, whereas those at the very high risk should work from home if possible.

Professor Singhal explains in her statement, we don't need to see this part of it, how that first draft of the risk assessment tool was submitted to the Welsh Government for consideration and discussion on 13 May, and it was then launched on 26 May, with a written statement being made to the entire NHS and social care sector in Wales the following day.

Now, insofar as you are able to comment, do you believe that the work of the risk assessment subgroup, and in particular the development and roll-out of the risk assessment tool, could or should have been earlier?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I think my understanding at the time was that the people worked at pace to try to develop this, and it was actually the first one in the country, as I understood it at the time, was the quickest one to be developed. Whether they could have developed one earlier, I am not able to say, but I believe they worked extremely hard and were able to develop this as quickly as they could, and in fact were modifying it as they went along because they wanted it to be as accurate a measure and as useful a tool as it could possibly be.

**Lead 2B**: We can see the actual tool at -- if we can have this displayed, please -- INQ000023242.

This is a live resource, intended to be completed by -- online by everyone working or volunteering in health and social care.

If we can go to the -- thank you.

That explains there the purpose of the tool. So it operates essentially in the same way as the draft that we'd just seen in Professor Singhal's witness statement. So, again, scores being allocated to certain risk factors and then, depending on an individual's score, they know what actions they should take.

You make the point in paragraph 34 of your group's report that the risk assessment tool has been developed to be used by all staff, so not just those from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds; that's right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: And in terms of recommendations, one of the recommendations you make in your group's report is to ensure the wide dissemination of the risk assessment tool and encouragement of the use of the tool in settings wider than health and social care?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: Professor Singhal, but also Jane Hutt in her witness statement to the Inquiry, explained how the risk assessment tool has been widely disseminated, and since May 2020 has been expanded to include education, childcare, play work, youth group, further education and also the police. And the tool continues to be used today. So the recommendation you made in your report appears to have been actioned effectively; would you agree?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I would.

**Lead 2B**: The next key theme I'd like to discuss is the communication of health and social care messages to black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. And again you deal with this -- just to locate us, it's paragraphs 49 to 51 of your report, but I don't need you to go to it.

Can you briefly outline some of the issues that you identified in respect of communication of health and social care messages?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I think there was a key barrier in the sense that the language of communication, which is English, Welsh, was not that which was spoken by many of the people from ethnic minority communities that we may have wanted to have reached and that were at very high risks, and we wanted to be able to encourage the government and the healthcare providers to be able to find ways of developing some of these things in different languages, messages in different languages, so that they could be able to communicate those effectively.

There was also the issue of the cultural differences and -- that might impact on the meaning of the messages being communicated, and the impact of those messages, and this was where we wanted to be able to use people with lived experience as much as we could to be able to ensure that messages reached the people who were very vulnerable but weren't initially receiving some of those messages.

**Lead 2B**: I think you say in the report that digital engagement and engagement with community leaders in particular was key --

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: -- is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes, yes.

**Lead 2B**: And the recommendation your group makes was to develop a clear multichannel communications strategy for health and social care, which identifies effective channels to disseminate information and includes funding for BAME targeted outreach and consultation activities?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: If we can, please, look at the Welsh Government's response.

So it's INQ000285930, and we're looking here at page 18.

Reflecting on your group's recommendation, the Welsh Government state that they have:

"... formed a cross-government group to develop a communications strategy which includes health and social services but also wider policy areas to ensure greater joined-up thinking."

Are you satisfied with the work carried out to date by the Welsh Government to improve public health and social care messaging?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: It is definitely better than it was before, so from that point of view I would say that there is an incremental progress in this area.

**Lady Hallett**: You understand that, do you, Professor? It goes on:

"... form a cross-government group to develop a communications strategy ..."

So all talking about communications, and then it talks about:

"Following recently-completed insight work and stakeholder channel mapping ..."

Doesn't sound like a very good communication in itself, does it?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: Anyway, what does that mean, "completed insight work and stakeholder channel mapping", as far as you understand it?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: My Lady, I think this is something for the government to ...

**Lady Hallett**: Well ducked, Professor.

**Mr Poole**: Professor, if we can, please, look at page 19 of this same document but the second paragraph, so a bit further on, the Welsh Government, in perhaps slightly clearer language, cite the fact that:

"The ... Test, Trace and Protect ... programme has developed a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Outreach Plan ..."

This is obviously written in September 2020 and updated later that year.

In your opinion, was the Welsh Government right to hold out the test, trace, protect programme as an example of an accessible public health messaging programme targeting black, Asian and minority ethnic communities?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes, I think there was quite a lot of emphasis on that at the time, and I remember that there was an initiative to engage people from minority ethnic backgrounds to help in reaching the people that needed to be reached at the time. So ...

**Lead 2B**: If I can move to another theme, that of security of employment and income, and you make the point in your report -- it's paragraph 59 -- that the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its analysis for England and Wales notes in particular that black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more likely to be employed in shutdown sectors. So, for example, Bangladeshi men are four times as likely as white British men to have jobs in shutdown industries. And similarly, black African and black Caribbean men are 50% more likely than white British men to be in shutdown sectors.

Now, in your report you note that in relation to key workers and those employed in occupations at higher risk of Covid-19, the analysis of Welsh employees shows that those from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds are overrepresented in healthcare and social care; is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: Your report makes a number of recommendations as to how the Welsh Government could mitigate the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 and employment support schemes as well on black, Asian and minority ethnic people in Wales.

One of those recommendations is for the Welsh Government to establish a social partnership-led job matching redeployment scheme across Wales. What has been the Welsh Government's response to this and to other recommendations your group has made in this area?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I know that social partnership is an area that the Welsh Government has been very keen to work on, and at the time they talked about developing that area, and I believe this is something that has been done and that is being done. Whether that has been enough or was enough at the time to mitigate the risks that were identified, I think it's a different matter. But then the time was limited to be able to judge that. But I know that they were interested in doing that.

**Lead 2B**: I think my understanding is that since your group reported, the Welsh Government has set up three regional employment response groups. Are you aware of that?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I -- not without going back to my notes now, not something I recall.

**Lead 2B**: If we can just look at the Welsh Government's response, again, to your report, so it's INQ000285930, but this time we're looking at the bottom of page 21, the Welsh Government explains the aim of, as I've just referred to, these three regional employment response groups. Then over the page, these groups will "focus specifically on the employability issues facing Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic people".

In your view, does the setting up of these response groups go some way to mitigating the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 that you've identified in your report or is this not enough or would you like to see something different being done?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I think the number of black and minority ethnic people that lost out from Covid-19 was very high and it's very difficult to see how this on its own would have been sufficient to have mitigated that loss.

**Lead 2B**: In the same section of this response, but a bit further down, so page 22 now, in the second paragraph, the Welsh Government referred to the fact that:

"Since 2016 [there has been someone appointed to] a Champion role, [although] now called a Strategic Equality and Diversity Lead ... to [increase] the participation of individuals from protected groups on to an apprenticeship."

And I believe the current Strategic Equality and Diversity Lead was a member of your subgroup; is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: The Welsh Government's response talks about equality, diversity and inclusion strategy and a suite of actions taken in conjunction with work-based learning providers to support black, Asian and minority ethnic people. Is this something that you have seen actually put in practice since your group reported?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I can't say that I have followed this intimately, no.

**Lead 2B**: I'd like to move to another issue identified in your report, which is the issue of living with race inequality in Wales. You make the point at paragraph 19 of your report that:

"The ... pandemic has further exposed existing racial equalities in Wales."

And you refer to the Equality and Human Rights Commission report "Is Wales Fairer?" which made some deeply troubling findings. You highlight some of these in your report, such as the fact that race was a motivating factor in 68% of hate crimes reported and recorded in Wales in 2018/19; is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes, yes.

**Lead 2B**: From your research, and in particular your engagement with people at a grassroots level that we heard about earlier, would it be right to say that higher levels of violence and abuse experienced by some black, Asian and minority ethnic groups has led to a sense of isolation and loneliness, perhaps a sense of not belonging?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: Did your research suggest that those feelings of isolation were exacerbated by Covid?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: Your report also highlights the link between loneliness and mental health problems, and the point is made at paragraph 22 of your report that mental health provision in Wales is not meeting demand. Is this a particular issue that your group identified in respect of those from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in Wales?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes. Mental health issues are more likely to be profound in -- they're more likely to be found in ethnic minority communities and they're more likely -- the consequences are more likely to be profound amongst those groups, so it was a particular concern during a pandemic like Covid that that would be exacerbated in that sense.

**Lead 2B**: In terms of recommendations, the Welsh Government made a commitment in March 2020 to develop a race equality plan for Wales. Now, the Inquiry understands that progress on that work paused in the early months of the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, your report recommends that work on developing that race equality plan should be progressed as a priority?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: And your report states that:

"The final Race Equality Plan needs to lead to [in your words] a substantive and comprehensive Race Equality Strategy for Wales."

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: Now, at the time that the Welsh Government responded to your report in late 2020, what was said is that the aim was to draft a race equality plan to go out to full public consultation by the end of 2020 with a final plan developed by the end of that Senedd term, which would have been May 2021. I think it would be right that consultation took longer than anticipated?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: But is it right that by June 2022 the Welsh Government were in a position to publish its "Anti-racist Wales Action Plan".

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: If we can have up INQ000227788, there is the first page of that plan.

And if we can go to page 6, please, you are described in this plan as the co-chair, along with Dr Andrew Goodall. Can you briefly explain your role in the production of this plan?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I was invited to co-chair the group, the steering group, that led the development of the plan, initially to co-chair with the then permanent secretary, Dame Shan Morgan, and then latterly Dr Andrew Goodall, and I -- we led the group, the permanent secretary and I led the group that developed the plan.

**Lead 2B**: If we can have a look, please, at page 23 of this plan, which is, I think, the acknowledgements section.

Set out on this page is a long list of individuals and groups that provided evidence and insight to help produce the plan, and we see there the third bullet point references the Covid-19 black, Asian and minority ethnic socioeconomic and risk assessment subgroups, so they were the two subgroups that we have been talking about earlier.

Is it right to say that many of the recommendations that we have looked at from the socioeconomic subgroup report have been incorporated into this action plan?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: The fundamental basis of the plan was to deal with those recommendations.

**Lead 2B**: And in terms of ensuring that the action plan is actually implemented, am I right in thinking there is an independent accountability group to oversee that?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: You are the co-lead of this group alongside Dr Goodall; is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: I think as described in an appendix to this action plan, which we don't need to look at, the overarching purpose of that accountability group is to ensure progress towards the purpose of the plan by holding those responsible to account for what they do or don't deliver; is that right?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Lead 2B**: Does that accountability group meet with members of the Welsh Government?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes, there is -- there are regular meetings with the social justice minister and bilateral meetings with other ministers of state, and also the permanent -- the First Minister as well.

**Lead 2B**: Just taking a step back, if we can, looking at the report that we started looking at, so the report of your socioeconomic subgroup, particularly the recommendations in that report, and then the work that was carried out culminating in this anti-racist action plan in June 2022, and obviously in your capacity as the co-lead of the accountability group, is this action plan being delivered in Wales?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: It is a work in progress, I think is the best way for me to describe it.

And why do I say that? I say that because it is trying to address a problem that is intractable. One of your classic definitions of a wicked problem, which is racism, and something that has existed for many generations, and it is trying to address it in a way that is very different from the ways in which people have tried to address this in the past, and those ways people tried to address it in the past have failed to deliver any change.

So because it is almost novel in its approach -- it's the only nation in the world that has tried this, Wales. Because it's almost novel in its approach, it's having to deal with multiple complexities and having to deal with multiple particularities in terms of the constituencies, the stakeholders that are involved, and it's been difficult in some cases to try to reconcile some of those differences, but it is a work in progress in the sense that the people that are doing it are committed to getting it right. The First Minister, the Minister for Social Justice, other political parties in Wales, have signed up to this, and we are, in a sense, fortunate to be able to have that political centrality, and what we are now doing is trying to sell this to the wider population in Wales, and that is a difficult task, but it's work that we are determined to succeed in.

**Lead 2B**: So it may, as you say, take time, but you have political buy-in, and within this action plan the structure is there to address the issues that you've identified?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: The structure is there to address the fundamental issues, because the fundamental problem is one of disproportionate outcomes that are defined or exacerbated by race and ethnicity, and if we can get that right, then what we will do is to bring ethnic minority people to the same level as everybody else. And there are other problems that other people are experiencing, but we will then all be at the same level experiencing those problems.

So those problems may not and are not necessarily going to go away, but at least we shouldn't then have worse outcomes within bad outcomes. So it's to bring everybody to the same level and then we can all experience the same problem or enjoy the same level of prosperity, whatever that may be.

**Lead 2B**: And in terms of the issues that you've identified in your report and that are identified in the action plan, in your opinion, is Wales in a better or worse position now than it was at the start of the pandemic?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I think Wales is definitely in a better position, better in the sense that we've at least recognised that racism is institutionalised in -- that's the understanding here in Wales and the acceptance here in Wales, something that is not the case in other parts of the country. So from that standpoint, I think we are in a better position to be able to recognise that there may be additional problems that may be linked to race and ethnicity that we would need to take account of if we were ever to be in this type of position in the future. Are we in the position that we will no longer have the problems? That's why I think it's a work in progress. Not at this point, I would not say, but I would hope that if the Anti-racist Wales Action Plan is to be implemented in full that we will be in a position in the future. But at this point we are not.

**Mr Poole**: Thank you, Professor. I don't have any further questions for you.

**Lady Hallett**: I think Ms Heaven may have.

Questions From Ms Heaven

**Ms Heaven**: Good afternoon, Professor Ogbonna, I represent the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru.

I want to ask you some questions, please, about the topic of access to PPE and :outline:`RPE` for black, Asian and minority ethnic health and social care workers, which you've already explained to CTI was an issue that you identified early on. So I'm going to start at the very first briefing of your group to the First Minister for Wales, Mark Drakeford, and Welsh ministers, which -- and this was the Covid-19 core group, which we know happened on 20 May 2020.

But before I get that document up, just so that you understand, we can see that you're not at that briefing, but I'm going to see if you can assist us, please.

So if we could first get that document up. It's INQ000221152, please, and I think it's page 3.

Just look at page 1 there. We can see, as I've said, this is the Covid-19 core group meeting, 20 May, and as we can see, as I say, you're not present, it's Judge Ray Singh and Professor Singhal who are giving the briefing there on that day.

So if we could go to page 3, please.

So this is where we start to see the update from your group, and we can see there's a welcoming there.

If we look at paragraph 24 we can see there has been an explanation that:

"The group [has] been working with stakeholders representing BAME communities, expert advisers ..."

Then if we go on to page 4, please.

I know it's very small there, but we can see at paragraph 25 there is discussion of the terms of reference -- thank you very much -- which you've touched upon.

If we look then at 26, we can see some background information as to the two groups that we've heard about.

If we go on to paragraph 27, we can see reference to the risk assessment tool that we've heard about.

Then if we go back to the main document, there are a few more general paragraphs, and at the end there, paragraph 31, the First Minister is thanking the group.

So what we can see from these minutes, appreciating that you were not there, is that there's no discussion in this meeting and indeed there's no evidence to suggest that the First Minister for Wales, Mr Drakeford, asked any questions about the lack of PPE and :outline:`RPE` in the hospital setting in Wales and whether your group had a view on this, being a significant risk factor to black, Asian and minority ethnic health and care workers contracting Covid-19, and indeed dying.

Now, if I just set a bit of context before I ask my question, it might be suggested that this is a curious omission because as we can see this is the end of May and by this stage a number of doctors, nurses and other health and social care workers of black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds had lost their lives, and of course we've seen from the letter that your group sent in that you were raising this as a real concern in the context of Wales.

Just to note, we know that the first reported death of a health worker in Wales was 6 April, and that was Jitendra Rathod, a heart surgeon at University Hospital of Wales.

Now, my question is this: you were not at the meeting but are you surprised that at this very first discussion that your group had with the First Minister for Wales, there was seemingly no mention by the First Minister of Wales of the significant and fundamental issue that many health and social care workers in Wales, including black, Asian and minority ethnic health and social care workers, simply didn't have access to PPE or :outline:`RPE`, let alone the fact that what they did have wasn't appropriate. So the question is: are you surprised that this didn't come up?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Without presuming to speak for the First Minister, what I would say is that it could well be that he had relied on the briefings he received previously, because -- I'm not sure whether I mentioned this in my previous answer, that one of the calls we had, one of the Zoom sessions we had, people that work in healthcare and social care, especially some nurses and doctors, were expressing concern that PPEs were not being distributed to them because they were locum workers, and the then Deputy Minister and Chief Whip was on that call and she instructed the senior civil servants that were on the call to investigate that and to instruct all health authorities to be fair in their distribution of PPEs and to ensure that there was no element of racism within that.

So whether they assumed that this was something they had already resolved or not, I don't know, but I'm not able to speak to that.

**Ms Heaven**: Okay. Let me move on to the second question, then. This is the Welsh Government response, and this is to your report, which we know was June 2020, and the Welsh Government response was December 2020.

So this is INQ000285930, and it's page 11, please.

Now, this is the section of the report which deals with the topic of PPE, and I'll come on to it in a minute, but let me just set the context.

You have already explained to the Chair and Counsel to the Inquiry that Jane Hutt had heard the complaints about the lack of appropriate PPE first-hand in the Zoom meetings. So the Welsh Government clearly knew there was a problem in wave 1 around access to PPE and :outline:`RPE`. However, if we look at this official response, and if we just look at it now:

"Effective supplies of suitable quantities of PPE are essential to protect the workforce in conditions where the risk of COVID-19 infection cannot be mitigated in other ways. The report of the Socio economic Sub Group emphasised the need to ensure sufficient PPE was available both now and for the future."

Then it goes on to explain some information about action that's being taken.

We can see in this official Welsh Government response that there would appear to be no acceptance or recognition from the First Minister for Wales, Mr Drakeford, because he authored and signed this response, that the Welsh Government had fundamentally failed black, Asian and minority ethnic health and social care workers in Wales in wave 1 by simply not providing access to any PPE and :outline:`RPE`, let alone appropriately fitting PPE.

So it might be suggested that this response therefore is weak and obfuscatory on this issue. Do you think this response from Mr Drakeford, on behalf of the Welsh Government, on this really serious issue of access to PPE and :outline:`RPE`, was adequate, bearing in mind what your group had identified?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: I hadn't interpreted it as such, maybe because I was in it and was aware that there were multiple layers, so there was often a problem of implementation, which I think is a key thing in achieving racial equality. A problem with implementation was the problem that was caused by middle and lower level managers doing their own things, which are often very different from what top management may want to do.

So my understanding was that when that issue came up the Deputy Minister was very strong and forthright in instructing the senior civil servants, and they went ahead and wrote to -- that was my understanding -- to all the healthcare providers, emphasising their role in this area. And whether or not then they should have included that in this report is a different matter, what --

**Ms Heaven**: This was the public response from the Welsh Government.

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Yes.

**Ms Heaven**: It would have been nice to have seen some reflection on PPE, wouldn't it, in there?

**Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna**: Perhaps maybe that should have been included in this report, to reflect that there was a concern about this and that that had been handled. But I didn't author the report so I'm not able to comment.

**Ms Heaven**: Of course, thank you very much.

Those are my questions, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Heaven.

You're a generous soul, Professor, I think. Thank you very much for your help.

**The Witness**: Thank you, my Lady.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Mr Poole**: My Lady, we're next going to hear from Professor Debbie Foster. We just need to do some rearranging on the counsel bench.

**Lady Hallett**: Okay.
