Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Lady Hallett**: I hope we haven't kept you too long, waiting too long, Professor Reicher, I'm sorry if we have.

**Ms Arlidge**: Thank you, my Lady.

You are Professor Stephen Reicher; yes?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: You almost pronounced it correctly. Yes, I am.

**Lady Hallett**: If you do it, then.

**Ms Arlidge**: Please, yes.

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: "Reicher".

**Counsel Inquiry**: My apologies. A good start, isn't it?

You've provided the Inquiry with two witness statements, one for Module 2 purposes, you didn't give oral evidence in Module 2, and obviously Module 2A, where you are here today.

The reference for Module 2A, dated 13 December 2023, is INQ000370347. That's hopefully come up on your screen in front of you and is a familiar document to you.

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Page 79, we won't need to turn to it, has your signature and statement of truth. Are you happy that the statement remains honest and true to the best of your knowledge and belief?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: It does. I mean, I have done a little homework since and gleaned a little more evidence since, but I think it only confirms the broad arguments I'm making in the witness statement.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

For reference for those who are interested, we don't need to bring it up, the INQ for the M2 statement is INQ000273800.

You are a professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews; is that right?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: That is, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I think you're regularly referred to in the phrase of "behavioural scientist", but as I understand it, that's not a term you prefer?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Yeah, I've never been quite clear what "behavioural scientist" means, I have to say, and I think sometimes it's a term that we like to get science in to make us sound a little bit more credible. I'm perfectly happy with being called a psychologist and, more specifically, a social psychologist.

**Counsel Inquiry**: As a social psychologist, your primary interest is in how humans interact with one another and in a social setting; is that right?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Yes, I mean, my research has been, on the whole, on group processes and collective behaviour, and so on the one hand I've covered a number of issues relevant to the pandemic, issues like social influence, social solidarity and leadership. Most specifically I have done work on human behavioural emergencies, mass behavioural emergencies, and I think it's that expertise which led me into the weird world of pandemic advisory committees.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Broadly speaking, is it right to say that the science or the behavioural science is a matter of understanding the impact, in terms of the context of this, of the pandemic, understanding the impact of human behaviours on how the virus is spreading and then also how to influence the spread because of the knowledge gained in respect of how it spreads?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Well, the way I saw the advisory committees working was that it is for the medical scientists to tell us what sort of behaviours are likely to spread the virus. I'm not an epidemiologist or a virologist, as will become abundantly clear, so I can't tell you what behaviours are necessary, but once they can say to me "Look, these are the types of behaviours that increase transmission", I can begin to think about, well, how might we be able to change those behaviours so as to reduce transmission.

So it's very much, to use a medical term, a biological term, a symbiotic relationship, where each depends upon the other. We very much depended upon them, I think they also depended upon us.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So to put it with an example, the epidemiologists will come to you and say the evidence suggests that the virus spreads as a result of :outline:`close contact` within 15 minutes -- within a metre of one another for 15 minutes or more, and you as a behavioural scientist, to use the phrase that you don't like so much, say "Well, how do we think about how we influence behaviour, what do we do to make people not stay within a metre of each other for 15 minutes in unventilated areas?"

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: To a large extent, although I would make a couple of points in relationship to that. The first is I think the whole dilemma of the pandemic and the reason why it's so difficult is that the core thing we needed to do was to keep people physically apart at a time when we know that being socially together is critical to human wellbeing. And early on in the pandemic, in 2020, we wrote a book called Together Apart, and I think it's in the evidence, which tried to summarise the nature of that dilemma. We're trying to deal with something that's really, really difficult.

The second thing is, and again this is going to be critical to the points I shall, I think, be making subsequently, depending on your questions, it wasn't us making people do anything, it wasn't us telling people to do anything, it was how can we engage with the public and jointly do something. And I think as long as we see things in a top-down manner actually we get things grievously wrong.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Again sort of applying what you've just said, in times of -- humans are inherently social creatures, as it were?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And no doubt in times of strain and stress require more social interaction or would be expected to have more social interaction and sort of community support at exactly the time when that social interaction was causing illness, the spread of the virus and ultimately death and --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Well, you see, I think -- that wasn't necessarily true, but I think we made a huge mistake early on in the pandemic when we talked about "social distancing", and that phrase became virtually universal, we talked -- "We've got to socially distance". Actually, we didn't have to socially distance, what we had to do was physically distance, because physical proximity led to the transmission of the virus that could kill you. We didn't want to socially distance people, we wanted to keep them together. And the fact we talked -- conflated the two, we talked about everything as "social distancing", meant that we didn't put enough effort into asking the question: how can we keep people socially together, how can we keep people connected, especially more marginalised social groups, during the pandemic?

So it wasn't a natural contradiction, I think we turned it into a contradiction by failing to recognise that distinction between physical and social distancing.

**Counsel Inquiry**: When did you start to see that contradiction really coming to the fore, in terms of the use of "social" --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Well, as soon as the phrase was used. As I say, we wrote a book -- academics are rather slow creatures, as you might have discovered -- we managed to write a book in I think two months because we felt this is such a critical issue. Such a critical issue. In fact there is a whole psychological literature which I've been involved in which shows the importance of social connection not only for physical but for mental health. Feeling part of a community. I could go through a long list, and I won't, of the various ways in which it benefits you.

So I was acutely aware of this tension right from the start and a lot of my work has been around how mass gatherings, collective behaviour, which is often seen in negative terms, is actually rather good for us in fostering a sense of community and improving our physical and mental health.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We'll come on during the course of your evidence to sort of specific examples but we've started down this path a little so let's continue.

So you recognised early on, as soon as the phrase "social distancing" -- was an issue, it created its own issue. Was this something -- was this advice that you were feeding into SGCAG and more broadly, beyond -- although I appreciate, having written a book, you might suggest it's out there, as it were?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Well, I think the core psychological issue for me is this: I've already made the point that, for me, one of the major implications of the pandemic as a whole is it told us behaviour matters, it doesn't just matter at an individual level, it's not just a matter of interpersonal relations, it matters at a systemic and societal and policy level. One of the first times that people thought of psychology and policy together.

But that then raises the question of what sort of psychology do you use?

Now, my work in general and on disasters as well shows the importance of bringing people together as a community with a sense of shared identity, a sense of "we-ness". Often when you look at the popular representation of crises, there is this notion that we panic. In other words, in a crisis we act individually, we all rush for the exits, we trample others, we turn a crisis into a disaster. Actually the evidence that I have been involved in, my colleague Professor John Drury, who's also on SPI-B, has been involved in, shows that what tends to happen in a disaster is that you have a common faith, a common experience, and people come together as a community. It's a frail sense, it can be undermined by government action, but that sense of shared community is absolutely critical in the pandemic response, in a number of ways.

First of all, it means people care for others. The early polling, for instance, showed that the major factor in adherence to measures was wanting to come out of this as a community, and our own research shows the key factor in adherence is not your individual risk, it's the collective risk, it's the risk to the community. So effecting a sense of community increases adherence. It increases solidarity in practical terms. We saw that 12 to 14 million people became involved in mutual aid groups, probably more if you include -- we've heard a lot about WhatsApp, but informal, street level WhatsApp groups where people looked out for neighbours. And also that sense of community is good for our physical and mental health.

So in a sense, if I had one message, it was: don't fear the public, don't fear their frailty, don't see them as a problem, rather understand that if you bring the public together as a community and, what's more, that they see government as being with and for that community, then the public become an absolutely key resource. They're not the problem, they're the most precious resource you have.

And all my interventions in a sense was about how do you achieve that, how do you scaffold that, how do you support that, how do you create that sense of community.

So this was one aspect of that absolutely key critical message that I was trying to get over in all the various places that I spoke.

**Lady Hallett**: Could you speak a little more slowly, please.

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Oh, I'm sorry. That's slow for me.

**Lady Hallett**: Oh, is it? I know the feeling, I speak too quickly.

**Ms Arlidge**: We have a stenographer who is typing away frantically.

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: I'm sorry, stenographer.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Could we -- in light of what you were saying about public adherence, could we look at paragraph 63 of your witness statement, please.

I think this is what you were taking us through, but I just want to sort of orientate ourselves. You talk about the -- sort of, how the -- the factors of public adherence to -- guidance, legislation, we'll come on to that shortly as well, but you say that the factors that have been seen before Covid came along were actively applied, remained the same in terms of the actual -- in the Covid response, despite the fact that of course Covid was somewhat unprecedented and rather different, no doubt, to the studies that had been in terms of disasters otherwise in terms of longevity and acute issues.

So you say that the first issue or the first factor is risk perception. So by that do you mean explaining to people and making everyone aware that this is a big deal, people can die, people can become very sick, or is it a broader sense of risk perception in that regard?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Okay, so I'm glad you've brought up risk perception, because I think it's an absolutely key issue, and I think there has been much misunderstanding of what was said around risk perception.

One of the criticisms made of SPI-B and of behavioural science in general is that we wanted to use fear to frighten people into adherence, but there is a huge difference between making people realistically aware of threat, so they can do something about it, and fear, which makes you feel "Well, we're doomed, there's nothing we can do".

**Counsel Inquiry**: The equivalent of --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: The point is -- sorry.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The equivalent of shouting "Fire!" in a room but not having fire exits that --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Well, the analogy that I've used is, you know, I don't say to my child "The world is a terrible dangerous place, if you go out you'll be killed", I say to them "Look, there are some real risks out there, like crossing busy roads, so be careful, this is what you do, you obey the green cross code and you will be fine". So if you give people realistic risk information combined with information about how to mitigate it, actually it doesn't increase fear, if anything it decreases fear because it empowers people.

And the core concept for me here is empowerment. You disempower people either by not telling them what's going on -- to hide risks from people doesn't empower people, it disempowers people. And you also disempower people just by talking about threat without mitigations. If you want to empower you do the two together. And that's what we were saying time and time and time again. You need to make people realistically aware of the threats, because if there's no threat why should you do anything. Right? If the virus either isn't there or can't harm us, why would you do anything from getting vaccinated, to keeping distanced or whatever? And there is ample research -- both from previous pandemics, the H1N1 pandemic, lot of research in Hong Kong, but equally in this pandemic -- that making people realistically aware is important.

Now, if I can just finish by going back to my previous point. If you have a sense of the public as psychologically frail, unable to deal with information, you say to yourself "Well, I can't tell them anything because they'll panic". Right? But if you actually have respect for people and are open with people, and not only give them information but the wherewithal to deal with that information, actually you can be really effective. And that's why that general attitude that the public are a problem, the public will be -- will panic, gets in the way of doing the things you need to do in order to be effective.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And you say in your statement, I think, as hopefully not paraphrasing too much on this, that the third element or the third factor is that social identification. So there's a sense of "all in it together", and that is part and parcel, is it not, of "we can do something, we can move forward if we're all in it together and we're all pulling for the same team, as it were"; is that what you mean by that?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: One of the problems of the pandemic generally is people talked in terms of binaries, it's either this or it's that, it's this factor or it's that factor. Of course when you deal with human behaviour there are always multiple factors.

Now, we tend to like lists of three, so I think I've given you three factors there, I'm not saying these are the only factors, however there was a hugely influential paper, probably one of the most influential papers in the whole pandemic in terms of behavioural science, which was published in Nature on harnessing behavioural science, and there we made the point that when you look at the research on disasters, this sense of shared social identity, of "we-ness", is absolutely critical. And Nature has just published an analysis which looks at all the literature that came out of the pandemic which confirms the importance of doing this. This only came out a month or so ago so I'm not sure if it's in the bundle, but the point is this: if I am young and relatively healthy -- sadly I'm not that young, but if I'm young, and I'll have my son in mind, he might say to himself if he was thinking individually "Look, I might as well go out during Covid because the risk to me is relatively minor", and the cost of staying in at 18 or 19 with your elderly parents is huge. Okay? So you do the cost-benefit analysis and you think "Well, I might as well go out". If you think in collective terms, right, now not the risks and benefits to myself as an individual but to the community, I say to myself "If I go out I might spread the disease and I might kill somebody who is elderly or vulnerable or whatever", and so the risk calculation flips over completely.

So thinking in terms of "we", having a sense of "this matters to us", becomes absolutely critical. And we've confirmed that with a paper published at the beginning of this year, which is that sense of collective identity and I care about the community.

And one of the things that worried me a lot was that as we went through the pandemic we started off and nearly everybody was saying that. Certainly as we shifted to notions of personal responsibility we began to help develop a notion of "I'm all right, Jack". And I think that undermined the response. I think it undermined it practically. I think also morally and ethically we produced a society which is less concerned about its more vulnerable members, and I think that is equally corrosive.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Might an example of that be, for instance, the vaccine passport that you speak of in your statement, in terms of all of a sudden you've got this -- you've been vaccinated so you've got a -- you've got your own thing to prove you're fine. And there is a risk, is there not, in those circumstances of forgetting the collective, as it were?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Okay, so I think vaccine hesitancy -- you've gone straight to the heart of it, that's a brilliant example of these issues and allows me I think to illustrate them very, very clearly.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Before you go any further, I suspect our stenographer is still going to be struggling, because -- so if you could keep it slowly --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Oh, I --

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- politely, I'm sorry.

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Do help me by telling me to go more slowly.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: There are two broad ways in which you can deal with vaccine hesitancy. One is to say people don't take the vaccine because they are too stupid or too immoral to care, they're selfish. So you can say there's something wrong with those individuals. Now, the problem with that is that when you look at the figures, the statistics on vaccine hesitancy they are much larger amongst certain groups, more deprived groups, ethnic minorities, in particular black British people, much less likely to get vaccinated.

Now if you go down that individualistic route, you then come up with conclusions like black people are either less intelligent or less moral than others. And hopefully none of us want to go down that route.

An alternative approach is to say it's not about the information itself, it's about our social relationship to the source of that information, do we trust those who are giving us this information? Do we trust those who are giving us this Information? And there is good reason to understand why certain groups have less trust in government, because historically they have been treated differentially. There was a report, for instance, that came out at almost the same time that those statistics came out, from the House of Commons, the House of Lords, which showed that 60% of black people felt that the NHS did not that take their priorities as its priorities. So the key issue becomes not the intellectual or moral abilities of the individual, it becomes the issue of building trust. And how do you build trust? Well, one of the ways you build trust is not to say there's something wrong with you if you have questions. You should have questions if somebody wants to inject something in your body. It's perfectly reasonable. So you shouldn't treat people in negative terms, you should engage with them, you should have dialogue with them, you should work through their communities. And in fact early on we wrote a paper on community engagement showing historically it had been massively successful around the world, especially with minority communities.

So vaccine hesitancy shows us some of the pitfalls of that individualist "there's something wrong with the individual", rather than that issue which says "what's primary are the issues of social relationships". How do we get people to see government as being on their side? Vaccines introduced for them rather than something done to them? How can we make people see government part of us rather than standing outside and waving fingers or -- that, or punishing or bearing down upon us?

**Counsel Inquiry**: We'll move on in a moment to enforcement issues and around legislation, but just coming back to the vaccine passport in particular, because in your statement I think you raise concerns about, paragraph 105 and 106, that -- just the concept of vaccine passports. And I don't want to get into the detail about how it all worked in practice --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- I'm sure the Inquiry will be dealing with that in due course, but what I'm interested in is the messaging surrounding that and how that fed into Scottish Government decision-making, because you say in your statement, don't you, that you had -- you were opposed to certification. Why was that?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Okay. So again we published a paper which showed that especially amongst groups who do not trust government, then vaccine certification increased or gave traction to the anti-vaxxer narrative of "They're trying to control us, they're trying to do something to us", and thereby decreased their willingness to get vaccinated.

It did have some positive effects, so for instance for people who didn't have that distrust, who hadn't got round to it, then if there were going to be consequences then they might as well do it. What that means is you would more rapidly, in a sense, vaccinate all those willing to be vaccinated, the problem is you would do that at the expense of widening the pool of those who were more resistant to getting vaccinated.

So my feeling very strongly was we should focus on engagement, we should focus on working with those communities, on listening to people. There are some very nice examples of that engagement in fact from Israel, where in Tel Aviv they took trucks to the downtown area of Tel Aviv, Dizengoff, and, you know, people could come in and they could have a snack, they could have a drink -- not alcoholic -- and they could get vaccinated. At the same time they did that in religious communities but there they didn't give them drinks and snacks, they gave them cholent, which is a stew that you -- that religious communities -- and so once you understand the different communities, what matters to them, how you engage to them, how you go to them rather than wait for them to go to you, you have a hugely effective intervention. And that to me was the way to go. Always respect people, listen to them, engage with them.

And so it's true of vaccine hesitancy, it's true more generally: respect people.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You say at paragraph 105 that one of your concerns about it, about vaccine roll-out and vaccine passports per se again was leading to a sense of invulnerability and loss of caution.

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Mm.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Is that -- to bring it full circle to where we started this discussion, is that -- the risk of something like a vaccine passport gives rise to the breakdown in the social identity, as it were?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Okay, so there has been a lot of discussion about if you make people safer in one dimension will they become less safe in another dimension. If you give people a Volvo, which is supposed to be -- I'm told, I'm not advertising here, but it's supposed to be the safest of cars, or at least was, do people drive more riskily? So risk compensation is the concept.

Actually the literature nowadays shows that it -- it's not clear there is risk compensation, what is critical is to give people clear messaging about what things do do and what people don't do.

Now, there is a danger again that if you don't respect people, if you think people are intellectually impoverished, you try to make things terribly simple. You either say a vaccine is perfect or others say it's completely useless. Okay? Actually I think the important message is to say, "Look, a vaccine is far, far, far better than not a vaccine, it does these various things for you, but it still doesn't do everything for you, so you still need to be careful, you still need to keep your distance, you still need to, you know, self-isolate if you're infected or whatever it might be". And the danger is -- again, it's this general attitude if you don't respect people, if you have a sense of the intellectual frailty of the public, it leads you to simplify and not do the messaging that you need to do in order to avoid risk compensation.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And how receptive was Scottish Government to your particular concerns in respect of vaccine passports and the risk of antivax, all that sort of thing?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: In general terms, and I think I've given a number of examples of this, nobody's perfect, we all learn and we all make mistakes, but what is undeniable, I think, is that the Scottish Government did far more, both in terms of this general notion of treating the public with respect and as a partner, than the UK Government did. And in my statement, for instance, I have compared and contrasted certain statements at the same time by the Prime Minister and the First Minister showing how, on the one hand, the Prime Minister tends to tell people off and to threaten to punish them, the First Minister tends to recognise the difficulty people have, the efforts that they are putting into compliance, and encourages them to continue with those efforts for the sake of the community.

So by and large, comparatively at least, I would say that the Scottish Government did better than the UK Government.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You talk in your statement at paragraph 12, the concept of Scottishness.

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Ah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'll just allow a moment for this to be brought up. I'm jumping around rather unhelpfully.

*(Pause)*

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. So it's the second half:

"In the Scottish context it is possible to draw on the idea 'We are Scotland' because Scottishness is more likely to be ..."

I've lost my note there.

"... understood in 'civic' terms (as including all those living in Scotland and committed to Scotland whatever their background) while 'We are England' is more problematic and more likely to be understood in ethnic terms (hence excluding those from ethnic minorities). Consequently, the advice as to how to build cohesion and solidarity was different -- and indeed in ... Scotland I had the pleasure of working with the 'creatives' in crafting public health adverts rooted in norms/values of Scottishness."

I'd just like to explore that with you briefly before the lunch break.

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What do you mean by Scottishness in "civic" terms, and how that impacted the advice you were giving to Scottish Government and their creatives in the messaging?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: That was a very dangerous question to ask an academic.

I mean, I've worked on national identity. A number of years back, we wrote a book on national identity, on the Scottish identity, called Self and Nation -- available at all good booksellers -- and I could talk for a long, long time, but I won't, I promise you, and I'll try to say this slowly.

I think there are a couple of key issues here that are really important. One is a broad conceptual point, that when I think about human psychology I think we are all equally human and the basic psychological processes we have are the same everywhere. But the way those play out is fundamentally different in different contexts, different cultural contexts. Okay?

So I am interested both in the general process -- I might say that if you create an inclusive social identity people will support each other within that broad community, but how you achieve an inclusive social identity depends upon the cultural resources and the cultural history that you may or may not have.

The second general point -- and I have been listening to you on the TV channel, and so I've heard various times people asking "Why on earth did we need a Scottish advisory group? I mean, surely it's the same pandemic so why did we have to have a different advisory group?" And the point is again that the context of Scotland is different at a number of levels. People have focused on geography, we are more dispersed, they have focused on comorbidities, we have more comorbidities in various areas, but it's also psychologically different.

So when you look at the notion of nationhood, people -- this is too simplistic, but people broadly draw a distinction between ethnic and civic nationhood. Ethnic definition is where I come from. Okay? By that definition I personally am not Scottish because I was born in England, my parents came from Russia and Germany and Poland. Okay. But if I look to my future and my commitments, right, I can call myself Scottish, because I'm -- live in Scotland, I'm committed to Scotland, my son was born in Scotland. So civic is very much about your future and your choice over your future, ethnic is much more to do with where you come from.

Now, in England, Englishness historically has been seen as more ethnic. You know, so for instance far-right groups use the flag of St George to denote an England which is defined in terms of whiteness. And the empirical evidence shows that ethnic minorities would find it very difficult to say, for instance, "I am Pakistani English", they might say "I'm Pakistani Mancunian", because they can relate it to a locality, but not to a nationhood. That's not true in Scotland, because over the last 20 or 30 years -- and these are balances, I'm not saying it's entirely one way or another but the balances move towards a notion of Scottishness which is to do with being here and committed to the nation.

It's beautifully expressed by Willie McIlvanney when he used the term the "mongrel nation of Scotland". What makes Scotland is we're not pure breeds, we are a mixture of all sorts of things. That's what makes us Scottish. So when you say "We are Scotland", you include ethnic minorities, you include people who have come from elsewhere. When you say "We are England", you are more likely to exclude and create a sense of division.

So it's a beautiful example of the social differences and the way in which you can use Scottishness to create a sense of an inclusive social identity which includes everybody and brings them together as opposed to an ethnic identity which divides people and which could exclude people and at worst can even lead to hostility against minorities.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You spoke about -- well, you were a member of SPI-B in the UK set-up, as it were, and then you joined SGCAG, as we call it, in April -- March 2020, April 2020, just after the lockdown. You joined that -- you joined SGCAG, I think, as a result of -- you reached out and said "Hang on a minute, you're not -- I think I can help and I can bring some expertise". What was your understanding about the Scottish Government and CMOs et cetera -- using the original title of SGCAG -- what was your understanding about the Scottish Government's recognition of behavioural science and behavioural management, as it were, in that sort of regard? Is that why you said "Come on, I can help, I can bring something to bear here"?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: The simple answer to that is I have very little understanding of the workings of government. I've always been an academic trying to understand various processes. I have worked with various groups with -- my work on crowd behaviour has influenced public order policing for instance, and I have been on one or two advisory groups about behaviour in emergencies. But by and large my understanding of the workings of government come more from Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister than any privileged knowledge.

I reached out to Rebekah Widdowfield, because she was then the general secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in which I was heavily involved, but I knew Rebekah from the past, from some of her directorates, talking about, if you like, the behavioural dimensions of environmentalism, resilience, and so on.

I passionately believe, and the important message I want to get over, is that behaviour matters at that systemic level and we need to understand that and learn that, both so we can contribute but also so that we can be involved. And so I knew nothing about the Scottish Government but I thought if anybody might help in making the case for behavioural science being involved in the debate, Rebekah would, because she had been doing that previously when she'd worked for the Scottish Government.

**Counsel Inquiry**: When you joined SGCAG you were the only, again to use the wrong phrase as it were, behavioural scientist on the --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: A little lonely, a little lonely.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- start. How did you feel your voice was heard in that room, as it were?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: There's always a danger if you think you're going to sound as if you're gushing, okay, but one of the things I learnt, and I learnt many things from my involvement, was how to chair a committee. I think Andrew Morris was remarkable. There was a -- he included everybody. He wanted to make sure that everybody had spoken. He defined a good meeting. He'd often say, "It's been a good meeting" -- everybody had spoken. He wanted to make sure that everything was covered. And so I got a really strong sense -- in part because of the others, because I think people recognised that symbiotic relationship I've spoken of, and it was facilitated both by Andrew and by the civil servants we worked with. I was very lucky to meet and work with such people.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Did you feel like the issue of messaging and the issue of recognising or seeking to influence human interactions and human movements in the context of the pandemic was something that was adequately recognised from the outset?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Okay, so people often when they think of behavioural science they talk about communication, okay. Now, I think communication is an aspect of it but I think the core issue was understanding the centrality of positive social relationships and in fact, and this is utterly key, a social relationship of trust both within the population and between the population and government. And Andrew used a phrase which I really liked when he talked about that "social contract of trust", and he was aware that that was utterly central to everything we did.

I used to say at the beginning, as many people did, that behavioural science would be important until vaccines come along, but I was wrong. The reason why I was wrong is that vaccines achieve absolutely nothing as long as they're in the bottle. It's getting vaccinated that makes a difference. So as soon as you have a vaccine, you have a new behavioural set of questions, which we've addressed in part: how do you get people to get vaccinated?

So it's not as if, you know, the pharmaceutical is primary, it will be the cavalry charging over the hill after which everything else becomes irrelevant, it's that at every single stage the behavioural and the medical need to go together, and absolutely key to addressing that is creating that social contract of trust. And in some ways -- as I say, that phrase came from Andrew, I think he understood it really well.

Now, as to whether others understood it, I don't know, because my experience was in the advisory group. I mean, I don't walk the corridors of power, I don't know what, you know, what ministers say to each other in private. But I do know that within that group I was deeply impressed by the extent to which it was seen as a community of equals from different disciplines.

**Ms Arlidge**: Thank you.

My Lady, would that be a convenient moment?

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, certainly. I shall return at 1.45.

**Ms Arlidge**: I'm grateful, thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: I gather we may have had a problem with the live feed this morning.

**Ms Arlidge**: Used to be, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: It's resolved by the sounds of it. Anyway, apologies to anyone who was watching and was affected by the problem.

**Ms Arlidge**: Thank you, my Lady.

Professor, before the lunch break, we were talking about influence -- using messaging to influence behaviour. In a world of social media disinformation and people simply not engaging with mainstream media, with the news, how do you get the message out to those people who are perhaps less likely to comply in the first place with that guidance?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: That's a really important question, I think, and again I would want to go back to this core issue of social relationships and trust.

You see, when people deal with misinformation, the obvious starting point is to ask about the nature of the information. But imagine a situation where, you know -- and actually it's a situation that happened to all of us, that you are sitting there, you're being asked to take a vaccine, to inject a vaccine into your body, and some people are saying to you, "This is really important, this will keep you safe, this will keep your community safe, it's a personal and a social responsibility to do it", and others are saying to you, "Don't trust them, they are not concerned with your wellbeing, they are trying to control you, and this vaccine hasn't been properly tested, it hasn't been properly developed, it's dangerous". Right?

Now, we're not vaccinologists, so in the end you've got to ask: who do I trust? Who do I think is on my side? Who is giving me this information to help me, who is giving me this information in order to control me?

So when it comes to that issue of information -- and it's not just about disinformation, the question is: why do we believe any information we're given? It's not the information itself, it's our social relationship to the source of that information that is often absolutely critical, and that's why trust is absolutely at the core of how you respond.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But how does that work in practice in terms of Scottish Government and when the First Minister, for instance, stands up to --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Okay.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- describe what's happening; how do you use that to get --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: I think it has to be in the context of that wider policy of engagement. So if -- you know, there you are, you're going for vaccination, and somebody says to you -- and you ask a question, you know, "What effect will this have on me if I'm pregnant?", "What is the impact on sickle cell disease?" These were questions to which non-experts wouldn't know the answer.

Do you on the one hand treat that person as dishonourable, as a fool, as -- label them as vaccine hesitant? Or do you say to them, "Really good questions" -- right? "Really good questions, we'll talk to you, we'll listen to you, we'll engage with you". So whatever that Scottish minister says, it will work better in a context where you are building trust, you are showing respect, you're engaging with people, and you're taking their concerns seriously, rather than just dismissing them as fools who are victims of disinformation.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But to what extent does the existence of those issues in terms of people who don't want to engage affect the decision-making, the -- the principles behind the decisions that are being made in government to say "We need to do this, we need to do that" and give advice -- and building up that trust relationship? To what extent is, in your view -- were Scottish Government aware of the impact of that sort of issue on the efficacy of their decisions?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Well, I mean, as I've said to you many times, you know, I'm an academic who sat in the advisory group. I don't sit in the corridors of power, I don't chat to ministers. I don't know. I mean, I genuinely don't know what there -- with -- what was going on.

In our advice, we said to them the key issue here, as everywhere else, is to do things in an overall context of everything you do of showing -- of building trust.

Now, one way you could build trust, for instance, would be for ministers to acknowledge the fact that this is complex and this is difficult and people are right to have questions, and then to build in processes where people can ask those questions. And also the types of initiatives I spoke about that happened in Israel -- not just in Israel, they happened in the UK as well, actually, working with black health workers -- to build those structures of engagement.

And the final point is in many ways actually you do far better not if a minister gets up but if respected members of a community gets up. If an imam, for instance, says to you "It is perfectly legitimate to take, you know, a vaccine", take a vaccine, you know, at particular times of year and so on. Work through communities. And the way you pose the question, "What does a Scottish minister do?", in a sense presupposes it's the Scottish ministers to do it themselves rather than to engage and facilitate communities doing things for themselves.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You talk about the need to build trust but in your statement you also -- of course it's -- in terms of compliance, there are two sides to it, isn't there, there is building the trust but then there's people being able to actually comply with the guidance or the rules and things happening, so --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Let me start off with the word "compliance", because the problem with compliance is it's a very top-down term. "You will comply with what I do", right? Whereas actually it has to be much more of a dialogue.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, let's take it in stages --

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: Okay, yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- because I need to take this quite shortly, and I don't -- I apologise for the timing, but I do need to take it in stages.

You have the -- you mention in your statement about the need for support quite regularly throughout the statement, and I won't take you to all the references but I'll take you to one in a moment, but it's right, isn't it, that the reality is, irrespective of the communications and the trust that can be built up, there will always be people who simply, as you say in your statement, as a result of the lack of support, are just not able to comply -- or not able -- whether the word "comply" is -- or adhere, and that cuts then into the way decision-making is made, is undertaken, because, for instance, if you don't have sufficient funding, support, money in the bank, as it were, and you know that if you get a test and you test positive, you have to self-isolate so you can't go to work, you might be less likely to take the test in the first place. If because you are unable to -- you don't have the money in the bank to buy your groceries at the end of the week, you might not be able to go into lockdown because you're -- with a positive test, with self-isolation, with a positive test, because you can't -- you will say you can't afford.

Now, in terms of the legality, the use of laws, in your statement you say that laws have -- the imposition of legislation is actually quite helpful in a lot of regards. But the simple point or the simple question I want to ask is: in circumstances where you -- as you say at paragraph 125 of your statement, that the Scottish Government "did little to heed the continuing calls for enhanced support", so effectively the carrot, as it were. In the presence of -- those people who are not complying with that legislation are likely to come from sections of society -- lower socioeconomic groups, perhaps less engaged in the trust process as well.

So in circumstances where the laws can mandate behaviour, and punish non-adherent behaviour, is there not a very strong risk that there will be an unequal, disproportionate impact on groups who are less able to comply with the laws than general public?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: So that's a wonderful question, and you need to be careful, you're turning into a behavioural scientist, if you're not careful you'll be up here.

I learnt many things during the pandemic, and one of the pleasures of being involved in the advisory process was learning by the other experts, and when it comes to behaviour my focus has always been on the motivational dimension, okay, so what is it that make people want to do adhere -- to do things, and I talked a bit, probably too much, about that today.

Others point to the fact that adherence depends upon three things: it depends on motivation, certainly; it depends upon in a sense having the capabilities, the information, so you know what to do; and it depends critically on the opportunity to support to do it.

So early on there was a study, I think it was in the spring of 2020, which showed that ethnic minorities and deprived groups are three to six times more likely to break lockdown. Nothing to do with motivation. Nothing to do with motivation, everything to do with the difficulties of more deprived and marginalised groups to stay at home and put food on the table.

So support was critical, and it was critical from day one of the pandemic.

So on day one of the pandemic, a new word entered the vocabulary, the word "Covidiots". It was the first time it was used. And this was the problem of people going out and congregating in parks. And if you remember, photos of people in parks, "Covidiots, look, they're congregating". Now, number one, those people were told that they were allowed to go out. Number two, if you're in an urban setting and you don't have your own garden, the only place you can go out is to the local park. And if there are aren't enough parks then you're going to cram.

So what is your response? If it to call people Covidiots, "You're an idiot", or is it to say "Actually, let's support people to be able to do something that the good for health", to go out, "and be distanced by opening more public spaces"?

SPI-B and I myself argued time and again: support people, support people so they can do what you're asking.

And it has a double benefit. Number one, it allows them to do it. But number two, if I ask you to do something which you can't do because of your practical circumstances, all it does is alienates you from me. It says: these people making the rules don't understand our lives, they tell us to do these things and we can't do them. So it undermines that social relationship fundamentally.

So the issue of support, time and time and time again, was absolutely critical. And time and time and time again it was: we weren't given enough support.

So the key issue here, because it's a key issue as you've heard from many witnesses, was self-isolation. The whole point of the testing system, the billions spent on it, was not to test people, not to trace contacts, but to get people to self-isolate. And if you didn't get them to self-isolate, you were wasting your money. Okay?

Now, the figures showed that people did quite a lot of things, and they adhered very highly in some areas. If you looked at the figures on self-isolation it was as low as 18.2%, and the reason for that is it's an extremely difficult thing to do. And after saying "support, support, support", in the end the UK Government brought in a scheme, the £500 scheme, right, which (a) was a small amount of money, (b) only one in eight workers qualified for it, and (c) 67% of people who applied didn't get it. So it was a tiny amount of support.

In other places like New York they had a wraparound system whereby not only did you give people more money, you offered them hotel accommodation, you even offered them support to walk the dog -- because that's quite important; if you're isolated, what are you going to do?

So there was a critical need for support.

Now, the Scottish Government did a little bit more and -- but it didn't do enough. Now, whether that was an ideological issue or a financial issue, that given the financial settlement they couldn't afford to do it, I don't know, but I would argue that if I look out, one of the major failures, in Scotland but in the UK as a whole, we didn't give enough support.

And I just want to make one final point, very briefly. Jeremy Hunt, before he had his present exalted position, was chairing one of the parliamentary committees, and he asked Matt Hancock the question that we've been asking: why was more support not given for self-isolation? And Hancock's response was: because we were afraid that people would game the system.

So again this disrespect, this lack of confidence in people, as being immoral and intellectually disabled, stopped us doing the -- I wouldn't say the one thing, but an absolutely critical thing we should have done in order to make adherence higher in the most critical area of adherence.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And to be absolutely clear, you were giving that advice to Scottish Government through SCAG on a regular basis, weren't you?

**Professor Stephen Reicher**: You've already pointed out that at times I'm like a stuck record, and we were like a stuck record on SPI-B. If I give you every quote when we talk about isolation, it would be that long, and the same would go from the Scottish Government -- uh, the Scottish advisory group.

**Ms Arlidge**: Thank you. Just bear with me for one moment, please.

My Lady, I think my time is up.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Arlidge.

Thank you very much, Professor. Your passion comes through quite plainly. Thank you for your help.

**The Witness**: Thank you.
