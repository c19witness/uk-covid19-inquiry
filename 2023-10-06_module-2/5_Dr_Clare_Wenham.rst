Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Ms Cecil**: Thank you, Dr Wenham.

You have prepared a report for the Inquiry entitled "Structural Inequalities and Gender"; is that correct?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes, that is correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: That's dated 22 September of this year, and can be found at INQ0002800.

Now, just to deal with some formalities, if I may, at the outset of that report, on the very first page, you have made a statement of truth.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: That confirms that this report is your own work, those facts are within your own knowledge, and that you understand your duty as an expert to provide independent advice. I've summarised it, but can I just confirm that's the position?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely, understood, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

If I may again begin, then, with your expertise and your professional background, you set that out in detail within your report, I don't propose to go through that in detail now, but in short you're an associate professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics, and your area of expertise is in the gendered impact of epidemics and broader health policy?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes, correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Now, just to deal with some matters, if I may, before we begin. Firstly, your report is entitled "Structural Inequalities and Gender", and you go on to speak about gender inequality, structure inequality and patriarchy.

Can I ask you first of all, in terms of gender inequality, what is the position within the UK? How does it fare globally?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: So the UK ranks relatively highly in terms of gender inequality, but that's not to say that gender inequality doesn't exist within the UK, and there are lots of examples I've given in this report of the ways in which gender inequality still exists within the UK.

**Counsel Inquiry**: How do you define gender inequality?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: So I think gender inequality is the differences of experiences and outcomes between men, women and other genders, mainly due to the structural inequalities that play out, which are governed by particular norms and particular policies, which don't ameliorate the social and cultural norms of gender across this country.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I think you say gender inequality is, at its heart, a structural issue?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And you see the manifestation effectively of that structural issue in gender inequality in everyday interactions in life?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely, because the structures and the policies which are created have a particular world view which are less easy for women to navigate than men in many instances.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Then what you deal with, following on from that, is the persistence of the patriarchy. What do you mean by patriarchy?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: So by the patriarchy I mean that there are certain cultural and social norms which exist whereby women are considered differently to men, and that the systems, structures, policies, way institutions are set up, way we live our lives in society, are all structured in a way whereby women are not able to exist in the same way as men.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you, Dr Wenham. Just to remind you, we have a stenographer, and so if we can take things just a little more slowly.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Sorry.

**Counsel Inquiry**: It's my fault, not yours.

Leading on from that, a very simple question in some respects, perhaps more complex in others: is the UK in your mind a patriarchal society, in your opinion?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes. Absolutely, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

How does that manifest? If you can just give us some high headline examples.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: So we know, for example that, the gender pay gap exists, men on average earn more than women. We know that women perform the burden --

**Lady Hallett**: Slowly, please.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: That women perform the burden of unpaid care within societies, they're the ones who are more likely to be looking after children, looking after neighbours.

We know that gender-based violence exists, where, you know, women are at risk of violence from male counterparts.

These are just some high-level examples demonstrating the existence of the patriarchy.

**Ms Cecil**: Thank you.

Now, I just want to talk about the scope of your report. We're going to go into some of those areas in more detail in due course, but just dealing with the scope of your report, the questions I'm going to be asking you about are in relation to those pre-existing inequalities, so inequalities that existed as at or before January 2020, so before the outset of the pandemic.

Just dealing with the position of the devolved nations for a moment, your report covers each of those devolved nations; is that correct?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: To the extent that their data was available.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Quite. And where it's possible to break down that data and provide nation-by-nation specific data, you have done so?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: I have done so. And where I have been unable to do so I've noted which administration it refers to.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. Then in general terms in the observations you make, do they apply across the devolved nations or are there any significant differences?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: In general they apply across the whole of the United Kingdom.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Within your report, you touch upon the position since 2010 and, in relation to commitment across the United Kingdom, to issues of equality and institutional mechanisms, including impact assessments.

Now, is it fair to say that, in relation to those impact assessments and policy and differences across the devolved nations, there is an insufficiency of body of evidence or data to make any meaningful observations?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: There is insufficient data to demonstrate a systematic difference between the way the different devolved administrations undertake impact assessments, although anecdotally there are different tendencies in the way the governments are going it.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Just again building on those inequality and the impact assessments, in terms of how that translates to policy, do challenges remain?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I now wish to turn to, if I may, paragraph 9 onwards of your report, which relates to the impact of epidemics and pandemics, in terms of the state of knowledge, of international knowledge.

Now, it's fair to say that there is a wealth of international research and knowledge that you set out within your report with regard to the impact on women as a consequence of pandemics, epidemics, health and other crises.

Just to headline those for you for a moment, you note the impact of the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zika outbreaks in Latin America, cholera in Yemen.

Now, picking up on that, you then identify those impacts. I just want to go through them if I may in broad terms. The three main areas, the first of those is healthcare. What impacts were seen globally and internationally in relation to crises?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely. So what we saw during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and again during the Democratic Republic of Congo was that the diversion of healthcare resources towards the epidemic meant that there was less provision of healthcare for women, particularly in maternal health services, and the impact of that, quite alarmingly, for example in Sierra Leone, during 2016, was that the same amount of women died of obstetric complications as did died of Ebola -- people, both men and women, died of Ebola.

And in DRC, when we saw many women scared to go to healthcare facilities when pregnant or when needing maternal healthcare because they were scared of contracting Ebola, we saw increased rates of maternal mortality amongst those women.

So there's a direct correlation there between people being scared to visit facilities and diversion of resources.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

The second area is in relation to gender-based violence. What lessons were to be learnt there?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Well, we've known from Ebola and from the Zika outbreak in Brazil, and from other crisis events such as Hurricane Katrina, that these crisis events have a knock-on effect on domestic violence in a myriad of different ways, but the headline is they do have an effect.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So one sees an increase in gender-based violence in terms of international crises and, indeed, epidemics, pandemics, but more broadly other crises that impact?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely, yes. And it's hard to disaggregate between whether it's the crisis event itself or the policies that are brought in to mitigate the effects of that crisis, but those two things are connected.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Then economic impacts, very briefly, if I may, Dr Wenham.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely. So we know that from previous outbreaks such as Ebola, when interventions were brought in to try to limit social interactions to stop the pathogen spreading, such as the closure of markets, that disproportionately affected women. Women were more likely to be working in those locations that were closed. And this wasn't just in the short term but in the long term it took longer for women to return to work after the epidemic event than men.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. I think you refer also to the fact that women tend to work in face-to-face roles, which are often either typically the first to close or obviously proximity to potential infection, and that they, in addition to that, take on that caregiving role?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Now, in terms of international recognition -- I'm going to turn to domestic in due course, but just very briefly with regard to international recognition -- you note the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board in 2019, so proximate to the pandemic, that recognised:

"... that care givers are women, and their engagement ensures that policies and interventions are accepted ... and it is important to ensure that the basic health needs of women and girls, including those for reproductive health, are met during an outbreak."

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely, yes, and that was also mirrored in the United Nations Security Council related to Ebola.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Now, a key and critical question that might be asked by some or posed by some is that, with the exception of Hurricane Katrina in the United States, these are all less affluent countries in the global south. So, essentially, why are they relevant to the UK, a western and industrialised country?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Well, because the thing that we see across all these outbreaks, whether they be in Brazil or in Sierra Leone or in Yemen is the same trends. It's the same ways in which women are impacted by these crisis events. It's always about unpaid care, it's always economic impacts and women losing work or financial security. It's always challenging access to healthcare for women and particularly sexual productive health needs. So it's the same trends globally, so, we know the concern is: why would it be any different here in the UK?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. And is that a view that you've heard expressed at all in the UK, or by government?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: It was something I heard expressed early on in the course of 2020, yes, I heard comments around the differences here in the UK to that of Liberia, for example.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In what context was that?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: In a meeting with officials working in government.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What area of government?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: In Cabinet Office.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In the Cabinet Office?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What was the sentiment that was expressed?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: The sentiment was it was London, it wasn't Liberia, and that there wouldn't be the same impacts here for women.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I now want to turn, if I may, to a separate topic, which is that in relation to public funding cuts since 2010 that you raise in your report, and you explain in relation to that that significant cuts had been made to healthcare, by 2015 over a billion, 6.3 billion from social care, 13 billion from education, and indeed, by 2020, £37 billion had been cut from welfare payments.

Can you, in headline summary form, for us, please help the Inquiry with how that specifically, in your view, exacerbates gender inequality?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Sure. So the two headline messages from the austerity-related cuts in the UK for women are this. The first one being that women are more likely to use public services, they're more likely to need interaction, whether that's through benefit support, whether that's through healthcare services, whether that's through a range of different ways that we see women engaging with these services, so they're more likely to be users, but we also know that women are disproportionate employed in the public sector as well, as healthcare workers in the education sector, for example.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If I can ask you just to pause there for a moment. Thank you.

You say that women form the majority?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Majority of the workforce in the public sector. So women are both impacted by these cuts as users of services and as staff and employees within public services.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm going to pick up on workforce in due course but it's effectively women form almost two-thirds of the public sector workforce. Just to follow on in terms of impact there, you relate to other characteristics as being important and that not all women are affected as a homogenous group. Can you just explain the importance of that in relation to public welfare cuts?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely. Well, we know that women are not a homogeneous group, we know that particular groups of women, whether they be particular ethnic groups, whether they be different socio-demographic groups, whether they be migrant groups, might be more likely to use these services than others.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Can I just say, my screen has gone blank.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I don't believe we'll be needing it, Dr Wenham, so please don't worry. If we do, I'll pause for a moment so that can be rectified.

If I can focus in on one aspect of those public sector cuts, we've just dealt with, very briefly, women as part of the public sector workforce but also as users effectively of public services.

Benefits. I'm looking at financial autonomy and benefit cuts.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You note within your report that in relation to Universal Credit caps that came into force, those apply predominantly to single parents, and 90% of those are women, is that right?

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry, Ms Cecil, I think we are straying a bit here. I mean, the fact that there were inequalities and that many witnesses have attributed that to austerity is obviously relevant, but I think we are going perhaps into a little detail away from Module 2. Sorry.

**Ms Cecil**: No, not at all, thank you.

I was going to move on in any event after this question to gender inequality and health, if I may, and looking at gender and interactions with healthcare systems.

Now, you point out a number of structural differences in the way in which women interact with healthcare systems as opposed to men. Could you, again, just set those out, please, in summary form.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Sure. So to start with, women are more likely to use healthcare services in their lifetimes than men, mainly because of the need for maternity and/or sexual reproductive health services. But gender also determines and influences health knowledge and health behaviour and how you might listen to advice given, and also how you might access services and when you might access health services. And this then has a knock-on effect on outcomes, depending on when you might have a visit -- visit a practitioner or whether you might follow advice or not. But it's on the supply side as well: the gender of a patient might impact on how a medical professional interacts and gives guidance in a consultation. So --

**Counsel Inquiry**: If I can pause you there just for a moment. Just to pick up on that final point, if I may, is it correct that women, and in particular black women, are less likely to have pain-related symptoms believed?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely, consistent evidence is showing that women, and particularly black women, are less likely to have pain-related symptoms believed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Turning now, if I may, to mental health and women, you say one in five women compared to one in eight men; why is that, in terms of suffering from mental health illnesses and conditions?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: It's hard to say conclusively, I think there's a range of different factors, and there's also differences over age and differences over ethnicity which I think are important to point out.

So there is not one reason, but the trends are consistent that particularly younger women suffer from greater mental health issues than their male counterparts.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I think immediately prior to the pandemic, young women's mental health, in terms of the impact upon them, was increasing at quite a great rate in comparison to boys; is that correct?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes, that's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I just wish to touch, if I may, very briefly on suicide. I am asked by one of the core participants to make it clear that certainly men, in general, have greater rates of suicide. Is that correct?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes, it's correct, and indeed the data from the Office of National Statistics show that men do have higher suicide rates than women. But I think it's also important to note that the data from 2021 show the largest increase in suicide in women under 24 on record.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Then just turning to women and clinical research, the position pre-pandemic, you describe that there is a lack of research on how conditions affect women in comparison to men, that women are less likely to be enrolled in clinical trials, but often subject to the same clinical guidelines. Can you just elaborate on that, please.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Of course. Historically most clinical research and most health research has been done on men and therefore most of the information we have about how to treat people with different conditions is based on men, and evidence in men, and so we don't necessarily have the same data quality, standards and volume of evidence about how conditions manifest differently and how treatments might work differently in women.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You describe the overall consequence of all of those factors within your report, and note that the UK has one of the largest female health gaps worldwide?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just for clarity, that's referring to the difference between outcomes for men and women for the same conditions?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes, that's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You've touched upon this already, at the very outset of your evidence, in terms of women and their engagement with healthcare, reproductive services, antenatal services, maternity services, in relation to that. Just dealing with one aspect of that for a moment, are there differential outcomes in relation to race and maternity?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes, across the UK some research in 2018 and subsequently has shown that the maternal mortality rate is up to four times higher amongst black women than their white counterparts in the UK.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And ancillary to that, the Care Quality Commission found that stillbirths predominantly occur in the most deprived areas?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes, that's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: One aspect of maternal care relates to the charging regime for migrant women for hospital treatment during pregnancy and antenatal care, midwifery and obstetric care. What have you seen as the impacts of that charging regime?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: The impact is that vulnerable pregnant women are maybe not seeking care or not seeking care following the NHS guidelines in the same way or the frequency of visits, because it has a deterrent effect, the charging regime.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Dealing now and turning to unplanned and unwanted pregnancies, you explain that approximately half of pregnancies in the UK are unplanned and approximately half of those again result in abortion. Just dealing with the position across the nations, in relation to England and Wales, you describe that it's a combination of NHS and independent sector provision. What are the consequences for women of that in terms of access?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Well, we know that even in places where there is a legal provision of abortion there are a number of structural barriers, such as: how close they might be to you; if you're using an independent service, whether that costs; for example, whether you're able to take time off work or other childcare to access these services.

So, you know, even with legal provision, there are a number of barriers to accessing abortion for many women across this country.

**Counsel Inquiry**: One of those issues is the inconsistent provision in geographic reasons, so necessitating travel?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

That's different in Scotland, where abortion provision is by the NHS. Northern Ireland, is it correct that specific challenges still remain in terms of travel and geographic availability?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely. So although the repeal of criminalisation of abortion took place in 2019, there remain a significant number of physical and structural barriers for women being able to access that particularly in terms of geographical proximity to services.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

And you note key developments during the pandemic, which of course will no doubt be covered by a later module.

If I may turn now to the labour market, and of specific relevance to this module is women as healthcare workers. What proportion of healthcare workers are women?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: So the data from England shows that 77% of those in the NHS workforce are women, and that's a similar number across the devolved administrations.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

To break further workforces down, in terms of health and social care, education and early years, that's predominantly, is that correct, staffed by women?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely, yes, those are all sectors predominantly staffed by women.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Up to 96% in early years care, 75% in education, and 58% of social care?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You describe that as occupational segregation?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What do you mean by that?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: There are differences in who works in different labour sectors and different industries across the UK and across the globe and we know that healthcare, health and social care, education and early years are predominantly staffed and worked in by women compared to men.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You then, just if I may, look at industries and role types. Do you see any similar patterns there in terms of occupational segregation?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: We know that women are more likely to be in the lower paid jobs and men are more likely to be in the higher paid and/or managerial positions within those industries as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You point out engineering, finance, those sorts of occupations.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Then, in terms of roles, men typically occupying director, managerial, senior roles within organisations?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: (Witness nods)

**Counsel Inquiry**: That leads me on, if I may, to the gender pay gap, very briefly. What is the gender pay gap?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: So the gender pay gap is now a statutory requirement across the UK for companies to report the difference in average hourly wages between men and women.

**Counsel Inquiry**: As at 2019, just to place this in context, the gap at that point was 17.3%, as a median figure; is that correct?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Between --

**Counsel Inquiry**: In 2019. It's at paragraph 39 of your report, if that assists.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Well, 8.6% across all full-time workers and up to 17.9% when including part-time workforce.

**Counsel Inquiry**: That's what I thought. You then talk about feminised sectors in relation to the pay gap and look at various professions. Can you just set out the differences there in relation to early years, doctors and clinical academics so that we get a broad picture?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Sure. So the feminised sectors such as early years care and a lot of healthcare activity is devalued in the labour market. That means that people are earning less in those industries than in other industries. So we know, for example, that, you know, there are much lower wages amongst early years and nursing professions compared to hospital doctors or other clinical higher grades.

**Counsel Inquiry**: To what extent can any of the pay gap be attributed to part-time work, and choice?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: I think that's a really hard question because I think we have to look at the structural factors of why people are in part-time work, and it tends to be because of the burden of unpaid care within the households and childcare. And the lack of affordable childcare provision across this country is a key reason why people have to take part-time work. So it's unfair to say that women always have a choice to -- you know, want to work part-time compared to full-time. That completely misses the drivers of why people have to work and the need to be able to afford to live, to feed your children and the vast cost of childcare.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

That brings me in to the issue of childcare and other caring responsibilities, including unpaid work. You speak within your report at paragraph 44 of the "motherhood penalty", and I'm going to ask you just to explain what that is, because it has some impact in relation to unpaid work later.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Sure. So the motherhood penalty is the phenomenon which exists whereby when a woman has a child and is out of the labour force for maternity leave, and then gets in, they're not necessarily at the same level, and the longer term implications of that, of having to, you know, leave on time to pick up a child, of having to, you know, take days off when your child is sick, for example, means that -- you know, data has shown that by the time a mother's first child is 12, her hourly rate of pay will be 33% that of a man at the same level of them. So they consistently don't get promoted and don't have the same earning potential once you have children.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

With regard to the role in terms of childcare and other caring responsibilities, how do we see that in terms of gender division?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: So we know that across the UK, the burden of childcare -- you're talking about unpaid childcare?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Falls disproportionately on women.

**Counsel Inquiry**: With regard to unpaid care falling disproportionately on women, does that just relate to their children or also relate to relatives, friends or other individuals?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes, we also know that women are more likely to be unpaid carers to those who have specific care needs, whether that be elderly relatives, parents for example, and they're also more likely to be engaged in looking after neighbours, working in voluntary associations within communities to support people.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I now wish to move, if I may, to another topic, and that is of domestic abuse and gender-based violence. Turning, if I may, to women's exposure to violence, can you just give a snapshot of what the picture was in 2019 in the UK?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Well, we know that domestic violence exists, we know that it had increased since the 2008 financial crisis because we know there's a connection between financial stability and violence, and, combined with austerity measures at the same time, put a downward pressure on households, and that in 2019 the Domestic Abuse Bill --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can I ask you to slow down a little, Dr Wenham.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Sure.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Please continue.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Okay. The Domestic Abuse Bill came into law in 2021, having been agreed in 2019, to try to facilitate better prosecution of abusers, noting that it's estimated that about one in five adults in England and Wales will experience domestic abuse in their lifetime.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. You talk about a downwards pressure, what do you mean by that expression?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: We know that there are various structural factors which affect the chances of domestic abuse occurring, such as financial insecurity, whether that be caused by losing your job or lack of access to public funds, for example, through austerity cuts, and that creates more tension within households, which then can turn into violence.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

With regard to the third sector, and funding for women's shelters and other programmes to support victims of crime, what state was that sector in in 2019, how would you describe it?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Well, it had also been impacted by the cuts to public sector spending, and we'd seen significant changes both at the local authority level and through grants available to independent and non-governmental actors in this space, so there was less provision and less finance provision for support.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Turning to sexual violence, at paragraph 53 you explain that there were over 55,000 reports of rape in 2019, immediately prior to the pandemic, and that Rape Crisis England had a wait list of over 6,000 at the time, in terms of support to be provided. I just want to touch on the position in the devolved nations. In Northern Ireland you say there was no specialist rape crisis support, only a counselling charity; is that correct?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: As I understand it, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You will be asked questions in due course in relation to migrant and refugee women and domestic abuse, and so as a consequence of that, I'd like to turn, if I may, to missed opportunities, and those that you see as the most significant going into the pandemic.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely.

So I think, referring to one of the first things we talked about earlier, which is that -- the impact that epidemic events can have on how women interact with maternity provision, for example, the evidence from Ebola shows that moving antenatal care and maternity services out of hospitals increased women's utilisation of those services. So women not feeling scared that they're going to contract a virus when they go into hospital for a completely different reason meant that they felt more likely they were going to, you know, get better care and more likely to use that service.

So that could have been something we could have looked at across the UK, moving maternity services.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just to pause you there just for a moment. So maternity services and antenatal provision.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Turning to the next aspect --

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Sure.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- does that relate to health and social care workers?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely.

So, we know that the majority of the healthcare and social care workforce are women, and therefore efforts could have been made to mitigate the impacts for those women, particularly when we know that women disproportionately suffer from mental health issues, particularly younger women in the healthcare workforce, those who are on lower pay and lower role jobs.

Efforts could have been made to try and mitigate those impacts, but also, knowing that the workforce is predominantly women, PPE could have been procured to better fit women's bodies rather than generic male size PPE being ordered.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Then if I may just pull together two aspects: in relation to unpaid care, obviously you say that aspect ought to be something that should be accommodated and considered in decision-making?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Absolutely. So if you know that women are the people who are going to do the childcare, if you are going to close schools, and that that would have an impact on women's paid employment, then mechanisms could have been put in place so that those women didn't have to leave their jobs, reduce their hours, and security could have been given to those women who were performing both paid and unpaid care at the same time that they had financial security to do so.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Other aspects in your report speak about feminised labour forces -- we're not going to deal with that in any greater detail now -- and you've made comments already and observations in relation to domestic abuse, so I don't consider that we need to go into that further.

In relation to moving forwards and general recommendations, with regard to gender and sex being taken into account, do you have any specific recommendation there?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: I do. The first -- mainly being that, you know, we don't know to what extent equality impact assessments were undertaken, they weren't made public in the initial months of the pandemic, or gender advisory and how this was considered and whether government considered the downstream secondary effects of the policies they were bringing in and how they might affect different sectors of society, and women differently to that of men, and what could have been -- how these could have looked different, had the question been asked: how will this affect women? How will this affect a particular social group?

**Ms Cecil**: Thank you, so looking at gender as part and parcel of decision-making and of course, as I said at the outset, your report really deals with the pre-pandemic looking forward position -- or looking backwards, rather, position and then looking at potential missed opportunities.

Chair, you've granted permission for a number of Rule 10 questions to be asked by Ms Davies on behalf of Solace Women's Aid and Southall Black Sisters.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

Yes, Ms Davies.

Questions From Ms Davies KC

**Ms Davies**: Thank you, my Lady.

Dr Wenham, I represent, as you've just heard, Solace Women's Aid and Southall Black Sisters, and I have permission to ask you questions on three topics, and they will be brief.

So the first topic relates to the point that you make in paragraph 48 -- and indeed Ms Cecil asked you about earlier -- poverty puts downwards pressure on the poorest people, exacerbating unequal power relations between highly stressed men and women, violent crime has increased since the 2008 financial crisis and this, combined with austerity measures, manifested itself in an increase in domestic violence.

That's pre-pandemic. Looking at pandemic and specifically lockdown, rather than the health side of the pandemic, can you comment on whether the pressures of lockdown could produce a similar pressure on those locked down, thus exacerbating the possibility of an increase in domestic abuse?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes, absolutely, this is what we've seen in previous epidemics that, you know, these effects, lockdown, being put under some sort of restriction of mobility, has that effect and has in previous epidemics as well.

**Ms Davies KC**: That's restriction on mobility being in the same house together?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes.

**Ms Davies KC**: What about the point that you directly make in the paragraph, the financial costs of lockdown and indeed anticipated financial costs and worries about future finances, loss of employment, what's going to happen to welfare benefits and so forth; can that produce a similar pressure exacerbating the possibility of domestic abuse?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes, I would believe so.

**Ms Davies KC**: Yes. And in the specific sector of those working in healthcare and in social care, they were under a great deal of very specific pressure in lockdown. Again, would that pressure on those workers increase the possibility of domestic abuse?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: I would imagine so, yes.

**Ms Davies KC**: Thank you.

The second topic is about migrant women, and it's paragraph 51 of your report, and you talk about asylum-seeking women, migrant women and refugee women, and I just want to break those three statuses down, because they have slightly different eligibility for welfare benefits, so that we're clear.

So the first status is asylum-seeking women, and all asylum seekers -- men or women -- don't have access to mainstream public funds, welfare benefits and so forth; they have a specific arm of the welfare state which is accommodation and support provided by the Home Office, it tends to be referred to as NASS accommodation.

So that's one status, and you say in relation to asylum-seeking women that they're particularly vulnerable to violence and abuse due to their precarity, so that's waiting on the decision on their asylum application. Then you also say many of these women had already been subjected to violence prior to coming to the UK, so that's again likely to be asylum-seeking women?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Yes.

**Ms Davies KC**: Then refugee women. They were asylum-seeking women, their claim for asylum has been successful and they are given various forms of leave to remain, sometimes indefinite, sometimes finite, but it is a more stable immigration position, and they do have access to mainstream welfare benefits, the right to work and so forth, as any British citizen does.

So although they, like any woman, might be subject to domestic abuse, there isn't an additional aspect of precarity hanging over them?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Well --

**Ms Davies KC**: Those who have refugee status and the right to live in the UK.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: So I am not able to comment on that --

**Ms Davies KC**: That's perfectly all right, yes.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: -- but I think it's fair to say that we know that risk of domestic abuse is intersectional and there are varying different vulnerabilities that women face. Asylum seekers, migrant status might be one of a multiple variety of different risk factors that any particular woman might face.

**Ms Davies KC**: Moving on to the third group of migrant women that you talk about in this paragraph, and those are women who are here and they have leave to remain but their leave to remain is subject to a "no recourse to public funds" condition, and that means that they cannot claim welfare benefits and are therefore financially dependent on their sponsor, who sponsored their leave to remain.

Are those the women that you are talking about when you say, "Perpetrators use women's precarious immigration status, poor access to alternative housing", and then just in the preceding sentence, "risk of destitution to threaten them"?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: Well, yes. I mean, the research shows that those women with no access to -- with no recourse to public funds have fear around accessing support services, therefore they are more vulnerable to the impacts of domestic violence.

**Ms Davies KC**: So the fear is a fear of being reported to the Home Office and therefore their leave being cancelled, a fear about that?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: I would imagine, I'm --

**Ms Davies KC**: You don't know.

**Dr Clare Wenham**: I don't know.

**Ms Davies KC**: That's fine. And a fear that, because they have no recourse to public funds, if they leave their abuser, if their abuser is also their sponsor, that they will be destitute. That's where you say "risk of destitution", that's their fear. And so that is both the real thing that they worry about and also something that a perpetrator of abuse can threaten them with; yes?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: I would imagine so, yes.

**Ms Davies KC**: So that puts them in an even more vulnerable position than women who are British citizens who are subject to domestic abuse, because they have that additional fear and threat hanging over them?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: I would imagine so, yes, but I don't think I'm the right person to comment on that particular detail. But I would say that there are multiple different layers of risk, both of domestic violence and how -- what you would do in that situation and where you would turn for help, if indeed you feel you can turn for help.

**Ms Davies KC**: Thank you.

Then the third and final topic, which you deal with at paragraph 47, and Ms Cecil asked you a bit about:

"At the same time that domestic violence has increased ..."

And you're talking pre-pandemic, you're talking in the years since the financial crash in 2008. You say:

"... funding for women's shelters and other programmes to support victims have been cut which, along with differences in commissioning practices in local councils, has created a geographic lottery for women survivors of domestic abuse."

So you make the point that, on one hand, in the years leading up to the pandemic, domestic abuse had increased and, on the other hand, funding to support the resources had decreased.

So given that that was the state of the violence against women and girls sector on the eve of the pandemic, and given that they then saw an escalation in domestic abuse and an increase in demand for their services, are you able to comment on how that left the violence against women and girls sector in an attempt to meet that demand for their services?

**Dr Clare Wenham**: I imagine your next speaker is better qualified to answer that, but my assessment would be that, you know, they would be struggling to manage the demand that they are given.

**Ms Davies**: Thank you very much, Dr Wenham.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Davies.

**Ms Cecil**: Thank you, my Lady. Do you have any questions?

**Lady Hallett**: No, I don't.

Thank you very much, Dr Wenham.

**The Witness**: You're very welcome.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you for all your help.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Ms Cecil**: My Lady, I understand that the plan now is to have a very short five-minute break.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm not even sure, do we need a five-minute break?

**Ms Cecil**: It's perhaps a matter for -- yes.

**Lady Hallett**: Is that a yes?

**Ms Cecil**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: Five-minute break.

*(2.32 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(2.38 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Ms Cecil.

**Ms Cecil**: Indeed. My Lady, may I call Ms Goshawk, please.
