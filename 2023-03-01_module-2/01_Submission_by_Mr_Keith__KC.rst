Transcript of Module 2 Preliminary Hearing on 1 March 2023

*(10.30 am)*

**Lady Hallett**: Welcome everyone to the second preliminary hearing into Module 2 of the Covid-19 UK Inquiry into core decision-making.

May I first of all explain the format for this hearing. As those who have been following the Inquiry's proceedings closely will know, the format has been different for different hearings. The first hearings for Modules 1 and 2 were in-person at our proposed hearing centre, with proceedings streamed for those attending remotely. However, the hearing centre that we have chosen for the bulk of our hearings requires considerable work to be done to be fit for an inquiry of this size. We hope that most of that work will be completed before the summer when we plan to hold evidentiary hearings. All evidentiary hearings will be held in-person subject to any emergency and they will be streamed to those attending remotely.

In the meantime, the Inquiry team had to find alternative solutions for the preliminary hearings in the timetable. I decided that the first preliminary hearing in each module must take place in-person if at all possible. That is why yesterday's hearing for Module 3 was in-person.

But hearings in-person away from the hearing centre are very costly and I have a duty to protect the public purse. I decided therefore that second or third preliminary hearings for each module could be heard remotely to ensure cost-effectiveness. Hence today is a remote hearing. I am in a building in central London and counsel to the Inquiry are in a separate room. Solicitor to the Inquiry is in the same room as I am.

In a moment Mr Keith, KC, counsel to the Inquiry, will outline the issues we will have to consider today. I'm grateful to all those Core Participants who have submitted their comments in writing for me to read in advance. But before I call on him, may I correct some misunderstandings in the reports of yesterday's proceedings and the release today of Government WhatsApp messages.

First, this Inquiry will not drag on for decades. I have been determined from the outset that the Inquiry must reach conclusions and make recommendations as soon as possible if we are to achieve our aim of learning lessons and reducing suffering in any future pandemic. That is why I sought the express agreement of the then Prime Minister to issue interim reports and I have given instructions to the module teams that that is what I wish to do whenever possible.

However, if we are to conduct a thorough and effective investigation it will take some time, despite the Inquiry team working flat out. I know of no other inquiry of its kind in the world, ie one in public, with statutory powers to obtain evidence, with Core Participants playing important roles, and with extraordinarily broad terms of reference. So with respect to certain commentators, comparisons to other countries are unhelpful.

Furthermore, I wish to emphasise: there will be no whitewash.

Second, I should like to reaffirm my commitment to ensure equalities are at the forefront of the Inquiry's work, and that means they are at the forefront of every module. There is no question of any group being sidelined or that I am not listening to them. I am. The only question is how we ensure we investigate inequalities properly and we investigate properly the disproportionate number of deaths in particular groups and communities.

In a moment, Mr Keith will outline some of the steps we have already taken. Yesterday, I heard submissions on the subject of structural racism and whether I should instruct an expert in that field. I will hear more submissions today on the same subject. But they are submissions. I have not yet made a decision.

Therefore, it is wrong to report that the Inquiry has made a decision it hasn't.

It is also wrong to accuse the Inquiry of failing to examine the issue of racism. It is something very much that we intend to do.

Before I hand over to Mr Keith, may I also repeat something I said yesterday in relation to the Listening Exercise, Every Story Matters. Some Core Participants, but not all, have complained they do not have enough detail of the exercise. It is a huge project and, again, probably one of the biggest of its kind. The Inquiry team, with the task of designing and developing it, have also been working extremely hard and doing their best to consult with the appropriate groups and organisations and explain to them what they are doing as they go along. But I have asked them to redouble their efforts to explain what they are doing.

To this end, the latest Inquiry newsletter will be published this week. It sets out in clear terms what has been happening and the team will be holding a webinar shortly at which they will attempt to answer any questions and give further explanation.

Could I invite those who have concerns to read the newsletter and/or attend the webinar.

I think I better turn to Mr Keith.

Mr Keith.

**Mr Keith**: I think, my Lady, in light of your predicament, we should probably pause for a moment or two.

Can we ensure the feed is cut for a moment and perhaps I pause until you are able to gain your breath.

1. Submission by Mr Keith, KC
==============================

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, this is the second preliminary hearing, the first one having been held by you on 31 October, almost four months ago. I don't propose to reintroduce the core participants or their legal representatives. There remain 39 Core Participants in Module 2, and all bar three are legally represented.

Written submissions for today's hearing have been received from 20 Core Participants and a number of those have made joint submissions. May I add my thanks and those of the Inquiry team to your own, my Lady, for those submissions. We are very grateful to all the Core Participants for having provided us with their observations and insights and also for the brevity with which they have done so.

I believe you will be hearing oral submissions from all Core Participants, in some cases jointly, bar one; that is to say, all the Core Participants who have filed submissions.

Since 31 October, a great deal of work has been done, and at a very considerable pace. As of yesterday, 81 formal requests for evidence under Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules have been sent out relating to entities, persons and organisations in Module 2 alone. 85 more have gone to entities and persons where the issues raised span not just Module 2 but Modules 2A, 2B and 2C also.

217 questionnaires have gone to members of SAGE and Independent SAGE. The Rule 9 requests are formal requests for documents and, in many cases, witness statements. Most are long and complex. Particularly in the case of key decision makers, for example Government ministers. To give you a sense of the breadth and the width of the Inquiry's breach, the Rule 9 requests include such entities and bodies such as the British Medical Association, the Cabinet Office, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, the Department for Education, Transport, Work and Pensions, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Health and Social Care, Treasury, the Home Office, Ministry of Justice, NHS Digital --

**Baroness Hallett**: Forgive me, Mr Keith, I have to ask you to stop. Not only have I started this hearing with a coughing fit, for which I apologise, but also we have a technical problem and I have asked we have a short adjournment. I'm really sorry, everybody.

**Mr Keith**: Of course.

*(A short break)*

**Baroness Hallett**: (No sound transmission) ... my coughing fit earlier, I hope we've resolved all the problems. Technology is wonderful when it works; but even the best technology can, I'm afraid, sometimes have problems. So, Mr Keith, if you could return, please, to your submissions. Thank you.

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, I gather there was a problem with the feed when I began to speak, but happily not a problem with the feed when you were speaking, so, with your permission, I will restart my submissions.

So, my Lady, this is the second preliminary hearing, the first one having been held by you on 31 October, almost four months ago. I don't propose to reintroduce the Core Participants or the legal representatives. There remain 39 Core Participants in Module 2 and all bar three are legally represented.

We have received written submissions for today's hearing from 20 Core Participants, and we are very grateful to all of them for having provided us with their observations and their insights and for the brevity with which they have done so. I believe you will be hearing oral submissions from all of them, in some cases jointly, bar one participant.

In terms of progress, since 31 October a great deal of work has been done and at a very considerable pace. As of yesterday, 81 formal requests for evidence have been issued under Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules. These have been sent out to entities, persons and organisations in Module 2. 85 more Rule 9 requests have gone to entities and persons where the issues raised span not just matters arising in Module 2 but also Modules 2A, 2B and 2C. Furthermore, 217 questionnaires have gone to members of SAGE and Independent SAGE.

Dealing firstly with the Rule 9 requests, these are formal requests for documents and, in many cases, witness statements. Many are long and complex, particularly in the case of key decision makers, for example Government ministers. But to give you a sense of the breadth and the depth of the Inquiry's reach, the Rule 9 requests include recipients such as the BMA, the Cabinet Office, the Chief Medical Officer, the CPS, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Departments for Education, Levelling Up, Transport, Work and Pensions, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, of course Health and Social Care, the FCGO, the Government Office for Science, and many more.

We have also issued Rule 9 requests to 11 regional mayors, including the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham. Rule 9s have gone to ministers, including Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock, Liz Truss, Michael Gove, Kemi Badenoch, Steve Barclay, Michael Ellis KC, Penny Mordaunt and Justin Tomlinson.

A request for a witness statement has gone to the Prime Minister, Mr Sunak, or rather it is due to be issued in the next week or so. We have also issued requests for witness statements from the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon; the former First Minister of Northern Ireland, Paul Givan, and the First Minister of Northern Ireland, Baroness Foster; the former deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Michelle O'Neill; and the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford.

Rule 9 requests will also be the sent to Professor Sir Chris Whitty, Professor Dame Jenny Harries, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam and Professor Sir Patrick Vallance, all of whom are, of course, extremely well known.

We have requested witness statements from persons who held positions in the Cabinet Office at Number 10. Such persons include: Lord O'Donnell, Simon Case, Helen MacNamara, Lord Sedwill, Dan Rosenfield, David Halpern, Lee Cain, Jack Doyle and Dominic Cummings.

Each of these witnesses has been asked to disclose to the Inquiry emails and other correspondence relevant to the issues addressed in their proposed witness statements, any informal or private communications about the UK Government's response to the Covid 19 pandemic to which they were party. And these documents include and are not limited to informal group communications such as text messages and WhatsApp group messages, private messages, email communications and contemporaneous diary or other notes. We have cast our net, my Lady, widely and with a fine mesh.

I should say that in respect of Government employees, we understand arrangements are being made to reassure civil servants that they can come forward and provide evidence to the Inquiry freely and fully.

Naturally, in light of certain press reporting concerning Mr Hancock's WhatsApps, we would also encourage anyone who has (brief loss of audio) information to give and whom we ourselves have not yet approached to come forward and contact us.

In September of 2022, Module 2 issued 200 Rule 9 questionnaires to our participants SAGE and its subgroups, and 17 Rule 9 questionnaires to members of Independent SAGE. We have also issued detailed Rule 9 letters to the participants of certain members of SAGE and its subgroups, such as Professor Michie, Professor Edmunds, Professor Medley, Professor Ferguson, Professors Horby, Woolhouse and Gowers and several more.

We have also issued Rule 9 requests for a witness statement and disclosure of documents from Professor Carl Heneghan, Professor Sunetra Gupta and Professor Anders Tegnell, all of whom attended a certain meeting in Downing Street in September 2020.

Turning to organisations and bodies relevant to at-risk or vulnerable groups. Module 2, in conjunction with Modules 2A, 2B and 2C, has issued over 80 Rule 9 requests for such organisations and bodies representing the interests of women, black and minority ethnic groups, children and young persons, those affected by health and inequalities, those suffering from mental health issues, older people, disabled people, workers groups, the bereaved, LGBTQIA, and the traveller, gypsy and Roma community. There will of course be yet more Rule 9s issued in due course.

My Lady, I will say a little more on the issue of expert evidence in a moment but I need to put to rest any notion, as you have done, that the Inquiry is not addressing the hugely important issue of structural racism. The Inquiry is indeed seeking to enquire into the two core issues of: firstly, the impact of the pandemic on at-risk or vulnerable or marginalised people and on black and minority ethnic groups; and, secondly, whether, in all that it did in relation to planning for and responding to the pandemic, the Government and the devolved administrations properly took into account the considerations and interests of black and minority groups and those who were at-risk or vulnerable or marginalised.

I say that with complete confidence for a number of reasons. Firstly, the terms of reference oblige the Inquiry to consider any disparities evident in the impact of the pandemic on different categories of people, including but not limited to those relating to protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 and equality categories under the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The characteristics that are protected by the Equality Act 2010 include race.

Secondly, you have repeatedly stated your determination to ensure that inequalities, including race, are addressed in every part of this Inquiry's unprecedentedly wide scope.

Thirdly, Module 1 is already enquiring into, by way of direct and forthright Rule 9 requests to Government and devolved administration planners, whether and to what extent pre-existing inequalities in the population were taken into proper account in planning for a pandemic. We have asked to what extent were inequalities considered as part of the UK Government and the devolved administrations' risk assessment processes. We have asked what structures were responsible for reducing inequalities in England and in the devolved nations and what role did those structures have in pandemic planning.

As you know, because you referred to it in the course of the Module 1 preliminary hearing, the Module 1 team intends to call Professor Marmot, author of the seminal report Fair Society, Healthy Lives, and Professor Bambra. Professor Marmot is one of the world's leading experts on, among other issues, the effects of the pandemic and the societal response had on social and economic inequalities.

Fourthly, the scoping document for this module, Module 2, states in the plainest terms that the Inquiry will identify at-risk and other vulnerable groups and the assessment of the likely impact of the contemplated non-pharmaceutical interventions, decisions in relation to social restrictions, lockdowns and so on, on such groups in light of existing inequalities.

Putting it plainly, did the Government and key decision makers, when making their core strategic decisions, properly have in mind and take into account the considerations and interests of black and minority groups and those who were at risk or vulnerable or marginalised?

When, we are asking, did they first become aware of the disproportionate impact of the pandemic, black and minority ethnic groups, and the appalling fact that -- likely through a mixture of unequal access to health services, existing inequality, and because many were frontline health and other key workers, which meant they were more exposed to Covid -- black and minority ethnic groups suffered disproportionate health outcomes and rates of death?

So we are addressing head on the issue of whether the Government's decision-making had prejudicial outcomes in terms of race.

That is why, my Lady, you have granted Core Participant status to a cross-section of inequality groups, to ensure that those questions are properly put.

The issue of inequalities, which necessarily include the position of black and ethnic minority groups, have been included in almost every Rule 9 request in Module 2. We've sent a Rule 9 request for a corporate statement to the Cabinet Office Equality Hub, which includes the Race Disparity Unit. Their response outlines the work the unit carried out in relation to the impact of the pandemic on ethnic minorities.

We have also sent a Rule 9 to the Equality Hub minister, Kemi Badenoch, Member of Parliament, the Minister for Women and Equalities, who was asked by the Prime Minister to lead on the UK Government's work on the assessment of the impact of Covid on ethnic minorities through the Covid disparities quarterly report, which then assisted the Government in its response to Covid. We have asked Kemi Badenoch a number of questions about this work on analysing and tackling the disproportionate impacts of Covid-19 on ethnic minorities.

We will be examining the substance of Public Health England's report, COVID-19: review of disparities in risks and outcomes, concerning the impact of Covid on disparities, including racial disparities.

We've sent a Rule 9 request to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, whom we understand will be well placed to assist us in looking at the impact of Covid on at-risk and vulnerable groups.

And lastly, the questionnaires to SAGE and Independent SAGE encompass questions on at-risk and vulnerable groups, and include specific questions relating to the diversity of advisers, SAGE and the subcommittees, to health inequalities, including race and economic inequalities, and the impact of such issues on the advice that they gave.

We have also sent a very significant number of impact questionnaires to bodies and organisations representing ethnic minorities from which we seek information about the extent to which they engaged with the UK Government on the impact of Covid in their communities, and their views on the extent to which the core decision makers in the UK considered ethnic minority communities when making their decisions.

Module 2, along with the relevant devolved modules, has sent Rule 9 impact questionnaires to a number of organisations representing and supporting ethnic minority communities, including Race Equality Foundation, the Runnymede Trust, Southall Black Sisters and Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations. It has also, finally, sent Rule 9 impact questionnaires to groups representing the bereaved, such as Covid 19 Bereaved Families for Justice, Scottish Covid Bereaved, the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru, the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, and Cruse Bereavement Support.

Turning then to Module 3, finally, as you know, because this was a matter in debate yesterday, the scope of Module 3 includes in terms, in its scoping document, at paragraphs 7 and 10, obligations on Module 3 to consider the impact of the pandemic on doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff by reference to ethnic background and deaths caused by the Covid pandemic in terms of numbers, classification and recording by reference to ethnic background and geographical location.

Later modules will continue to consider inequalities, as you have said. And at their heart will undoubtedly be the fact that, as the very latest ONS data shows, despite the gap closing in recent months, almost all minority ethnic groups died disproportionately from Covid.

My Lady, from the plainest terms, the very issue that some in certain quarters have questioned, namely the Inquiry's determination to address the impact of the pandemic and the Government's response on black and minority ethnic groups, far from being ignored, runs like a steel wire through the entirety of our world. I repeat, we are absolutely investigating the factors which caused minority ethnic people to die at these appalling disproportionate rates.

My Lady, at the same time, the very fact alone that the Inquiry has reached out to the many bereaved groups by way of the Rule 9 requests that I have mentioned, put their views, insights and, I'm bound to say, very helpful leads, demonstrates our unwavering commitment for engaging with them too.

I now need to turn to the issue of expert evidence and the suggestion that expert evidence be called to assist you in relation to the issues of institutional racism and structural racism.

As you know, my Lady, a number of organisations have called for such evidence, and they have also called in relation to whether the Inquiry is looking at structural racism at all.

I have just addressed you in relation to all the many areas in which the Inquiry is looking at such an issue but some in certain quarters have claimed that the Inquiry is not addressing the issue of structural racism and nor is it considering the issue of the extent to which the Government understood the possible impact of its decision making and the actual disproportionate impact of the pandemic and its own, the Government's, responses.

The claim, as I have said, that we are not looking at those issues is wrong and unfair. But there is a need to separate and distinguish between whether the pandemic exacerbated racial disadvantage, disproportionately affected people of colour, and whether the Government and devolved administrations' actual decision-making led to the perpetuation of racial and cultural disadvantage, and whether such advantage or disadvantage or discrimination was institutionalised in those Government bodies and entities.

As I have said, the impacts and the nature of the decision making are absolutely at the centre of the Inquiry. In addition, the Inquiry is already looking intensely at the way in which protected characteristics were or were not properly safeguarded in the particular context of each module.

But such an inquiry cannot of itself establish that racism was institutionalised. Whether it was is essentially a finding of fact. A finding that there was a system in place in which public policies, institutional practices, cultural representations, did work in a way that perpetuated and embedded racial group inequality. But that is a wider and more complex issue.

If that is the conclusion that you reach (namely, that such practices and beliefs were embedded and had become institutionalised), I have no doubt at all that you will not hold back from saying so.

We will obviously -- you will obviously consider the Core Participants' submissions as you always do concerning the instruction of expert evidence, but I would be failing in my duty if I did not introduce three notes of caution.

First, as has been said in legal jurisprudence concerning discrimination cases, a finding of institutional racism must depend on what inferences it is proper for you to draw from the primary facts. It will be a matter for you to determine whether you find that such institutionalised racism existed, of course with the help of the Core Participants. So before you could do so, there would have to be a proper factual foundation.

The second point is a related one. Having an expert opine on whether she, he or they think there was structural racism may be of little utility given that ultimately it is a matter of fact for you. But you will, of course, bear in mind everything that has been said on that point from the Core Participants in their written submissions and no doubt orally to you in due course.

Third, it will be difficult to go about building the foundations for such a factual finding in Module 2 because Module 2 is not looking at every part of Governmental structure in the United Kingdom or, because of Module 2, the UK Government structure. It is looking at the core decision-making and so the reach of the Inquiry in terms of what documents we call for, what people we examine, and what issues we look at in detail will be confined within that boundary.

We are not looking at the entirety of the Government structure, which is of course where you would need to look to see the indicia of embedded institutionalised racism.

But, my Lady, those points are all put forward by way of submissions. You will reach your own view, as you have already today stated that you will, as to whether the Inquiry should instruct and call experts to assist you to decide whether there was structural or institutionalised racism; but as to whether the Inquiry is indeed looking at those issues, of that there can be no doubt whatsoever.

May I then turn to some of the specific requests which have been raised concerning the scope of Module 2, the issues which Module 2 seeks to address, and some of the individuals and entities in respect of whom the Core Participants encourage us to issue Rule 9s.

**Baroness Hallett**: Before you do, Mr Keith, I understand one of the Core Participants is having problems being admitted or re-admitted to the call and I wonder if we could pause now and let that person in.

*(Pause)*

**Baroness Hallett**: I really would rather we didn't wait until the break because it is important ...

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, it may be possible for whoever that person or entity is to follow on the YouTube link.

**Baroness Hallett**: Very good idea. Could we please send a message to the person to come in at the break and in the meantime follow on YouTube. I'm grateful. Thank you, Mr Keith. Sorry to interrupt you.

**Mr Keith**: Not at all, my Lady.

In relation to some of the specific requests made in the very helpful submissions advanced by all of the Core Participants, the Inquiry is in a position to address them as follows, and I should also say that all of them will naturally receive your very close consideration or at least those that I don't address straightaway.

Covid 19 Bereaved Families for Justice, Northern Ireland group, at paragraph 7 to 11 of their written submissions, raise some very important points about Northern Ireland, the feature that the island of Ireland is a single epidemiology entity and the extent to which the collapse of the power-sharing agreement may have impacted the response to the pandemic.

My Lady, you directed in fact in December that the legal teams should directly explore into the relationship between the devolved Governments and the UK Government and between the Government in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and the island of Ireland as a single epidemiological unit. It is also very much an issue with Module 2C but in Module 2, and as far as we are concerned, we have already sought the views of Governmental Rule 9 recipients and the degree to which these issues played a part in their decision making.

Rule 9s have been sent to key decision makers in Northern Ireland and the Rule 9 request to Michael Gove, Member of Parliament, and the First Ministers of the devolved administrations have asked about the role that the British Irish Council played in facilitating inter-governmental relations. So we have those issues very much in mind.

The 85 or so Rule 9s issued to cover matters covering issues which span Module 2 and Modules 2A, B and C, the question has been raised in relation or the extent to which they address Module 2 issues. The vast majority have been sent to organisations which operate across the United Kingdom and so are issued on behalf of all four modules. But some, of course, are naturally specific to a particular devolved administration, such as Children in Wales or the Northern Ireland Youth Forum. Those will have been issued jointly by Module 2 as such organisations may potentially have been affected by decisions made by both the UK Government and the devolved administrations.

We have invited them to provide comments about both the response of the UK Government as well as those of the relevant devolved administrations of the nation in which they are based. So we have that breadth of request again very much in mind.

Thirdly, witness statements have indeed been requested in the majority of the Rule 9 requests and where we have requested responses to questionnaires, rather than statements, we will consider whether it is necessary in the course of preparing for the oral hearings to have the responses formally produced by a statement in due course. But the questionnaires which have gone to SAGE and Independent SAGE will remain as such for the time being. They will, nevertheless, all be disclosed.

Fourthly, we have not asked any specific questions of the Government decision makers concerning the extent to which those in custody were considered when core political and administrative decisions were made because that is an issue that is likely to be reflected in the material which we get back, in any event, and the issue of those in custody is more relevant for a later module.

I have addressed the important issues identified in the written submissions of FEMHO concerning structural racism, institutional racism and the need, as they see it, for expert evidence. But they also raise the issue of whether UK laboratory field modelling and case studies at the onset of Covid included references to race and/or ethnicity and if not, why not? We are very grateful to you for raising this issue which we will look at.

The issue of disability data collection, relatedly, has been raised by the disabled people's organisations and again, thank you, we will look at that.

The Long Covid-related Core Participants asked whether they will be asked to provide further information. They have already received a request which they have responded to. I can't answer that question today because we are still considering that helpful response.

But I should also say that Rule 9s which we have recently sent to key decision makers include questions about the extent to which consideration was given when making decisions about NPIs to the risk of Long Covid or health sequelae arising from Covid 19 infections.

My Lady, we have been asked whether we will be calling expert epidemiologists and public health experts in Module 2 on the development of the pandemic. This is unlikely, although we will reflect further because we will, in any event, be calling a multitude of epidemiologists in Module 2 on this essentially factual issue.

In relation to the disabled people's organisations' submissions, and the extent to which Government decision makers and advisers did specifically have disabilities in mind, we have sent a Rule 9 request to Justin Tomlinson, MP, the former Minister for Disabled People, about his role in relation to the United Kingdom government work. We have also received back from our Rule 9 request to the Government Equality Hub, considerable detail about the work of that hub and of Mr Tomlinson in considering the impact of Covid on disabled people.

But more generally, in our Rule 9s to the core decision makers, we have asked to what extent sufficient consideration was given in decision making, the impact of NPIs on at-risk and other vulnerable groups, and also the extent to which they considered and produced equality impact assessments when those decisions were made. Disability, as you know, is covered as a specific protected characteristic.

The disabled people's organisations raise further a number of helpful suggestions in relation to the scope of the expert reports which have been commissioned from Gavin Freeguard, Alex Thomas, Professor Ailsa Henderson and Professor Hale. There is much in those submissions for us to consider. We will do so.

Some of the issues which they have raised are already addressed in Module 1 and have been the subject of Rule 9s in that module. Government bodies have been asked general questions about the extent to which vulnerabilities and inequalities were considered. We will consider specifically the suggestion that a Rule 9 be sent to the Equality Commission.

Several of the Core Participants have asked whether the expert reports in Module 1 will be disclosed or at least made available in Module 2. The short answer is that by the time of Module 2 the expert reports and the evidence in Module 1 will be in the public domain and available.

But it is also likely we will seek to formally introduce parts of that expert material on the basis that it will be of assistance and relevant; for example, the reports from Professors Sir Michael Marmot and Clare Bambra.

We are very grateful to Save the Children UK, Just For Kids Law and the Children's Rights Alliance for their suggestions and we will consider them.

Turning to the Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru's submissions, paragraphs 2 and 3, these are matters that we had very much in mind, some of them in fact have already arisen in the context of Module 1.

We have asked core decision makers generally about the decision to use Public Health legislation to govern the UK Government's response to Covid-19 rather than the Civil Contingencies Act, and we have asked to what extent that decision took into account the potential that it could lead to a divergence of approach in the response to Covid across the nations in the United Kingdom.

We have also asked about the processes for scrutiny and review of Covid legislation and the regulations.

Submissions have been advanced in relation to the director general of the Covid-19 Crisis Coordination for the Welsh Government, Mr Kilpatrick. Module 2B say that he is on their radar and they intend to send him a Rule 9 request in due course.

Turning to the local government association, they raise issues concerning access to and use of data by local Government during the pandemic. They have asked that the details be given of local data provided to the UK Government to inform its response to Covid and the use of data and modelling related to issues in the outline and scope. That is an issue which we have already addressed in our letters of instruction to Gavin Freeguard.

They also ask about the treatment of those in social care and the issues surrounding the managing of social care. Those are in fact the issues which will be addressed in a later module, the module concerning social care.

Turning to, finally but by no means least, Southall Black Sisters and their written submissions. Whilst we have sent a Rule 9 to the Home Office we have not sent separate Rule 9 requests to the paragraph 9 organisations, the organisations that they refer to in paragraph 9., namely the Forced Marriage Unit, the joint Home Office FCO unit, the Interpersonal Abuse Unit and the UK Visas and Immigration department.

But Rule 9 requests have been sent to all the organisations that they list in paragraph 11 of their written submissions, a Rule 9 has been sent to the Cabinet Office Equality Hub, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner and the Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales. The Rule 9s which we have sent to organisations and bodies working with or representing at-risk or vulnerable groups all of course raise the issues which they themselves sought to raise in their written submissions.

Finally, they raise at paragraphs 11 to 16 issues concerning Northern Ireland, the power sharing collapse. That, as I have said, will be a matter that will be addressed in M2C, but it will naturally find reflection to some extent in Module 2 because, of course, the fact of the power sharing arrangements in Northern Ireland and the political position there was very much a factor that was in the mind of the Government when making decisions in Westminster.

My Lady, many thousands of documents and exhibits have been received from the documents provided so far. They amount to hundreds of thousands of pages, although, of course, not all of them are relevant and disclosable.

I want to commend the legal team in Module 2 for their diligence and hard work in scoping, drafting and issuing so many Rule 9s, and in dealing with a vast array of documentation which has already been received.

May I then turn to disclosure. I addressed you on the Inquiry's disclosure processes in the confines of Module 1, on 14 February, and you gave a ruling on 17 February in which you referred publicly to the disclosure process. This, as you know, and as the Core Participants also know, is the burdensome process whereby each document must be individually reviewed, sifted for relevancy, redacted where necessary, and then sent back to the document provider for comment.

The process is not free of difficulties. But, in light of the fact that the commencement of Module 2 has inevitably gone back in view of the delayed start of Module 1, the problem is now less acute than it is in Module 1. As we explained in the counsel to the Inquiry note sent to the Core Participants in advance of this hearing, each and every document is required to be reviewed and irrelevant information, including to a very large extent personal data, redacted in accordance with redaction protocols which of course the Core Participants have seen.

Such irrelevant information, my Lady, includes the names of junior officials who did not take relevant decisions themselves or whom did not substantially contribute to the decision making or who played no important role in the implementation of decisions.

Such persons can obviously be distinguished from those persons who did hold more senior positions, persons in the Senior Civil Service who took decisions or implemented decisions. There is no secrecy issue here, my Lady, let alone a row, contrary to the suggestion in some quarters. The redactions are being made because they are the names and the personal data of individuals who are irrelevant because they played no material role. But nevertheless each redaction is provisional and, of course, it is subject to change as a result of further inquiries we make or matters raised by the Core Participants following disclosure to them of the redacted document.

But the problem that we are faced, as you know, is that given the profusion of policy documents and Government emails, there are thousands of redactions, the redactions of junior officials' names and personal data that are required to be undertaken. And in many cases it is very difficult for the individual lawyers to be sure that a particular name is irrelevant, notwithstanding the exclusion of that individual from the list of the important persons or the persons who took the decisions that are material.

So the process of disclosure has slowed down considerably. But as you would expect, the Inquiry team has taken a number of steps which we are confident will speed the process back up, whilst ensuring that only irrelevant information is redacted. So we have increased the number of reviewers to review the documents, we have blocked redacting headers to emails, and we are working towards a system of automatic redaction by the document handling system of email addresses that are not relevant.

Plainly, documents have not gone out to the Core Participants quite as speedily as we might have wished, but we remain determined to disclose as many documents as soon as we can. And of course in that process we continue to rely upon the assistance of the Rule 9 document providers and of the Core Participants themselves.

Contrary, my Lady, as you've said earlier -- contrary to what has been said in certain quarters, as you said earlier, the Inquiry has commenced its formal processes. Documents have been sent out. There are dates now in the diary for the evidential hearings and we are running at a very fast pace indeed.

Some of the Core Participants have suggested that we disclose documents to the Core Participants without the redactions on the basis that they will keep that irrelevant but personal data confidential to themselves.

The difficulty though, my Lady, is that the Core Participant groups extend for many thousands of people on account of the breadth of their own memberships and maintaining confidentiality would be difficult. Moreover, we have to make redactions at some point given that many of the documents will be publicly disclosed in due course and it is far easier and more sensible to do that job now. As of yesterday, we have disclosed 3,747 documents from a variety of entities and organisations and we anticipate disclosing around about 1,500 more over the next week or so.

Turning to the issue of the hearing length, Module 2 is currently scheduled for eight weeks. We note what is submitted in relation to whether that is long enough. But given the bulk of the documents have not yet been received, and given your own stated desire to have hearings that are relevant and not undermined by the passage of time, I'm loath to suggest to you today, considering an extension in the length of that provisional hearing date, given the impact of such an extension on the rest of the Inquiry, but my Lady I am sure that you will reflect on what has been said by the Core Participants and, as I have sought to emphasise, the date and the hearing, or the hearing length at any rate, is currently still provisional and we will keep on eye on it.

Relativity. Some Core Participants have expressed a degree of concern or at least frustration with the functionality of that system. Epiq is providing training sessions and there is a link to access videos of that training. We are also exploring options to provide the Core Participants with some additional functionality in terms of coding functions and an update will be provided shortly.

As for the disclosure of the metadata that is sought by one or two of the Core Participants, it is common practice for inquiries to disclose pdf images with redactions applied and necessarily with limited metadata. In part, that is to ensure that any sensitive information embedded within the materials or within the metadata is not inadvertently revealed. The documents disclosed to Core Participants need to be suitable for publication, as I have said, in their existing form.

Parliamentary privilege I can deal with shortly indeed. It is not an issue that need detain you because, although it was raised in the CTI notes for Modules 1 and 2 out of an abundance of caution so that Core Participants could understand the general approach that the Inquiry is taking to the issue of Parliamentary privilege, you ruled in your 17 February ruling, that there are no issues of principle that require determination given the practical approach adopted by the Inquiry. That remains the position.

The next issue, my Lady, on the agenda is experts. Some of the Core Participants, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Northern Ireland, and FEMO, have asked that the letters of instruction be disclosed now. My Lady, as I have submitted in the past, providing the letters of instruction now is neither necessary nor sufficient.

Firstly, the Core Participants already have an indication from the monthly updates the broad areas to be covered. Secondly, it is not necessary to have such disclosure now because there will be time enough in advance of the process of dealing with the witness evidence proposals for the Core Participants to receive and consider the draft expert reports themselves.

Lastly, the provision is not sufficient because the letters of instruction provide only the framework for any expert report and can say nothing, of course, about what the experts' opinion actually is. The Core Participants need the draft reports themselves in order to be able to understand what is being opined upon. That is what we are providing.

Turning then to the issue of Rule 10 and the process by which Core Participants played their part, contributing meaningfully to this process by way of commenting on proposals put out by the Inquiry for how witnesses should be examined, and the process by which they may apply to you, the question of witnesses themselves. Submissions have been made in relation to that process in particular by the Long Covid groups.

My Lady, consistent with your ruling in Module 1 the Inquiry intends to put into place an additional process whereby the Core Participants, following the submission of their submissions, and observations on our witness proposals, may be permitted to meet counsel to the Inquiry in advance of the hearing so as to be able to better explain the submissions that they have advanced, to put forward further observations in relation to their proposals. In effect, it is an informal route by which they can return to the fray and reargue points with CTI. My Lady, it is a second opportunity to bend our ears and we gladly accept such a proposal. Of course, all Core Participants will be entitled to make applications under Rule 10(4 (that's to say, Rule 10(4) of the Inquiry Rules) for permission from you to ask questions of a witness.

The Scottish Inquiry. My Lady, on 23 February, the UK Covid Inquiry and the Scottish Covid-19 Inquiry published details of how they will work together by way of a memorandum of understanding. The memorandum signed by both Inquiries includes commitments to provide clear information to the public about how each Inquiry will carry out its investigations in Scotland and the United Kingdom, minimise duplication of work, so information sharing, and maximise value for money. The Inquiries intend to meet monthly, will share information on the topics and discuss issues which arise which are of common application and common concern.

My Lady, I know, and you have stated to those concerned with this process, that you are committed to exploring opportunities to share facilities, to avoid duplication, and to ensure that the most can be done to ensure no duplication and that members of the public, in particular, know to which Inquiry they may direct their own concerns and enquiries.

Ms Mitchell, on behalf of the Scottish Covid Bereaved, has raised an issue about the extent to which the findings and recommendations of one may be incorporated by the other Inquiry. This is still to be worked out. But there is of course no legal impediment to one Inquiry formally receiving evidence collated by the other Inquiry or to one Inquiry, having properly considered its own evidence, reaching a view that is reflective of the views reached by the other.

My Lady, may I then turn finally by way of substantive submissions to the issue of the Listening Exercise, Every Story Matters. In your Module 1 ruling, you directed the Inquiry team to consider ways in which the communications with Core Participants of the details of this important process could be improved.

As many of the Core Participants will be aware, a newsletter is shortly to be sent out containing a great deal of detail, alongside details of a webinar to ensure that as many people as possible can understand the work that is being undertaken, but let me attempt to provide some of that detail.

The Listening Exercise will provide different ways for people to share their stories which, when considered against the background, inequality and the diverse nature of society of which I have already spoken, will be vital to its successes. There will be a web form with a save and come back feature enabling people to tell their stories at a pace and in a place that's right for them. This is in fact, or will be, an improvement to the form that's already there and the Inquiry's thanks go out to all those who have used the existing pilot form and given such valuable feedback so far.

But for those who cannot go online, there will of course be alternative ways for them to share their stories, including a phone line, a paper form. There will also be in-person sessions, held to reach seldom heard or unrepresented groups. The Inquiry is looking to hold community listening events across the United Kingdom, and those sessions will be attended by Inquiry staff. We know you are anxious to attend if time permits given the demands of the public hearings.

I emphasise that the Inquiry will be taking a trauma-informed approach in all aspects of Every Story Matters and emotional support will be available. Trauma-informed training will be provided for anyone speaking to members of the public about their experiences and we hope to ensure that all those who speak and share with the Inquiry and its staff their stories are safe and supported.

Experiences, the stories, will be gathered and analysed by experts in research and analysis -- not, I hasten to add, by media or communication firms and I will come back to this issue in a moment.

But, my Lady, because we don't have enough capacity in the Inquiry team to process hundreds of thousands of maybe more experiences and stories, we have to procure the specialist expertise to help us to make the system work. Reports will be produced, as my Lady you have said in the past, for each relevant module investigation and these reports will then be submitted as evidence, disclosed to the Core Participants and published as part of the hearings for each module of the Inquiry.

The way we plan to gather people's stories will help the Inquiry to obtain as broad an evidence base as possible about the impact of the pandemic. It will assist the Inquiry to reach robust findings and recommendations.

My Lady, in recent days in certain quarters, concern has been expressed about one particular aspect of this process; namely, the involvement of a particular third party which is believed to have worked with the Cabinet Office throughout the pandemic and yet has been stated by some as being involved in some way in the listening aspect of the proposed Listening Exercise. So may I make a number of points about this.

The use of the company called 23red, a subcontractor in fact, gives rise to no conflict of interest, either actual or perceived. This is because 23red worked as part of the Covid hub led by the Cabinet Office and was concerned in distributing a range of Covid-19 related communications. It was not involved in any decision making that matters to us. It was one of the vehicles by which the Government got its messages out to the public. So that role gives rise to no conflict with any use in this Inquiry because it is currently only a communications facilitator.

Public communications are needed to engage people across all four nations in the United Kingdom and to enable them to take part in Every Story Matters. We require specialist communication expertise to help us determine the best way to engage people to share their experiences, particularly those who are under-represented or not always heard, and that's the expertise that 23red brings. It brings experience of building partnerships to organisations across society to share information, again, I repeat, to enable us to hear what is being said but not to be involved in the analysis in any shape or form of what those experiences amount to.

The company is not involved in any way with the listening part of the Listening Exercise with the receipt of the experiences, with the members of the public who contact the Inquiry, or with the analysis of the information. All that will obviously be handled by the Inquiry and other appointed experts and suppliers.

The involvement of 23red is also actually limited to the current pilot stage of the Listening Exercise. The tender process for the next phase has not yet concluded. More information will be coming out in the coming weeks about what will be procured. But ahead of that point, may I say something about the procurement rules that the Inquiry must follow.

The procurement of the services we need to deliver the Listening Exercise have to be conducted through the Crown Commercial Service. The Crown Commercial Service provides commercial expertise to a wide number of public and third party sector organisations. It provides the Inquiry with a route to market through a pre-approved suppliers who enable the Inquiry to secure the services that we need. The alternative, my Lady, would be to recruit more staff to run the procurement process in-house with higher costs to the taxpayer and may also lead to a less effective procurement.

We can't exclude any company from being on the Government framework -- when I say "Government", I mean the Crown Commercial Service framework -- or bidding for work if they wish to do so. But, plainly, we seek assurances from all suppliers that there is no conflict of interest and we demand the disclosure to us of information to allow us to decide whether one might exist.

So it is possible that the new contracts to be procured could include 23red -- they are legally permitted to bid -- or they might not. But it is important that the Inquiry follows the proper procurement rules and is fair and transparent.

Finally, may I also say that the Inquiry has appointed a six-member ethics review panel to provide independent, ethical oversight of the research (unclear) and the approach of the Every Story Matters exercise, chaired by the Queen's University Belfast professor, David Archard.

My Lady, I hope those submissions address the concerns which have been expressed in some quarters concerning that particular subcontractor.

Commemoration is an issue which is addressed in counsel to the Inquiry's note. A series of meetings have been scheduled with the Bereaved Families for Justice Group Leeds and others to ask for their support in finding people who would either be willing to be filmed for videos or to speak with artists to hep us shape the tapestry which forms the basis of the commemoration process. Progress has been excellent and the Inquiry team has been hugely moved, in fact, by the stories that have been shared so far and we are confident that, through working with the artists who have been engaged, we will be able to produce emotive and impactful pieces of art and video.

Procedurally, some of the Core Participants have suggested that there be a further preliminary hearing in the summer in addition perhaps to one in September. My Lady, it is an sensible suggestion and we have it in mind. Further details will of course be provided in due course but such an additional preliminary hearing is likely to be in July.

Related to the issue of a further preliminary hearing, may we ask you to consider the issue of the provision of a list of issues by the Inquiry team? That then will provide a basis upon which submissions can be directed at the preliminary hearing and will give the Core Participants a better understanding of the direction of Module 2. May we invite you to direct that the Module 2 team provide such a list of issues by the end of April or early May, depending on what you hear in due course in a moment from the Core Participants.

Two further relatively academic issues. May we seek your permission to publish the Core Participants' submissions and the note from counsel to the Inquiry on the website. And, finally, I should just say that the public hearing in this module, Module 2 will take place at Dorland House at Paddington, London, W2.

My Lady, those are all the points that I wish to place before you and to address you upon. You may consider this is a convenient moment to give the poor stenographer a break from his or her endeavours.

**Baroness Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Keith. We will break until 12.05 pm, please.
