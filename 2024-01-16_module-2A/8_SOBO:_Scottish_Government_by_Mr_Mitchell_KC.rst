8. Submissions on Behalf of the Scottish Government by Mr Mitchell KC
=====================================================================

**Mr Mitchell**: Thank you very much, my Lady.

This is the opening statement on behalf of the Scottish Government. I appear today along with junior counsel, Jennifer Nicholson-White and Kenneth Young, and we are instructed by Caroline Beattie of the Scottish Government Legal Directorate.

We wish to begin our statement by acknowledging the suffering of the thousands of families who have lost their loved one due to Covid-19. This is a loss that we know is felt to this very day. On behalf of the Scottish Government, we would like once again to give our condolences and sympathies to all of those who have been bereaved by Covid-19.

The Scottish Government appreciates that legitimate questions arise as to the strategic decisions made during the pandemic and the way in which they were made. Of course it is relevant to bear in mind the context.

Firstly, Covid-19 posed an unprecedented systemic threat to global health, to healthcare systems, economic activity and wider society.

Secondly, it was the Scottish Government's responsibility to address that threat posed to the people of Scotland. The complexity the systemic challenge created by the rapid spread and evolution of the virus, together with the whole of society aspect, meant that there was no single simple and certain way to respond. The Scottish Government's strategic aim was to minimise the overall harm of the pandemic.

Thirdly, the Scottish Government acknowledges that certain decisions could have been taken differently. Whether alternative options were practicably and realistically open to it and whether they would have made a material difference are separate questions and will no doubt be explored in evidence.

Finally, it need hardly be said that all decisions taken by the Scottish Government during the pandemic, irrespective of certain consequential and deeply regrettable harmful effects, were taken with the aim of the protection of the people of Scotland as the core guiding principle, that is to minimise the harm created and to reduce the loss of life.

With those brief introductory remarks, I now turn to the six areas in which I would wish to make comment, and we deal with these in far greater detail in our written opening statement.

The first is the period January to March 2020.

By late January, early February the Scottish Government was well aware that it was facing an increasingly serious situation.

By early March, all of the UK governments were engaged in an intense analysis of early data on Covid and its impacts. On 12 March, the response in Scotland and throughout the UK moved from contain to delay as, for the first time, community transmission had been confirmed as occurring.

Events moved at a fast pace, with measures and guidance introduced following scientific advice directed at, amongst other things, self-isolation, mass gatherings of 500 people or more, the closure of schools and nurseries as well as certain businesses, and the minimisation of social contact.

On 17 March, as we have heard, NHS Scotland was placed on an emergency footing. Significant work was done to ensure that the health service in Scotland was ready to deal with the modelled high numbers of people requiring hospital treatment. A large amount of guidance was issued to the social care sector. Work was done to ensure supplies of PPE were available as well as reliable distribution routes.

At this point, we would like to pause and to acknowledge on behalf of the Scottish Government the severe impact of the pandemic on the social care sector. Deaths that occurred in care homes and that were attributable to Covid-19 accounted for a significant percentage of all Covid-19 deaths in Scotland. Restrictions on visiting caused unintended pain and suffering. Residents, their relatives and care home staff all suffered. The Scottish Government acknowledges this. Evidence on this issue will surely and understandably figure in this and future modules.

On 23 March, the decision was made to impose a package of measures that came to be known as a lockdown. Based on the clinical and scientific advice from SAGE and the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, the judgement was made that additional measures had to be taken to suppress the spread of the virus in order to avoid significant health harm and the overwhelming of the NHS.

The Scottish Government was fully aware that a lockdown would have far-reaching consequences, but it was judged that the threat to human health was of such significance that the strategy had to be pursued.

The lockdown was highly effective in reducing community transmission and the level of infection, serious illness and death within the UK. Of course it was not without consequential effects on health, including mental health, loneliness and isolation, and levels of domestic abuse.

With the benefit of hindsight, possessed with current knowledge as to the nature and effects of the virus, the Scottish Government would have wanted to impose a lockdown earlier. As stated, that is with the benefit of hindsight. That desire apart, practicable barriers would have stood in the way of that decision, such as the need for the UK Government to provide the necessary and consequent financial resources, for example through schemes such as furlough.

The second issue that I would like to look at is leadership, the underpinning structures and decision-making.

Core decisions regarding the handling of the pandemic in Scotland were undertaken by Scottish ministers. Within the Scottish Government, a high degree of formality surrounds decision-making. Even during the necessarily intense and rapid framing of its response to the pandemic, it sought to maintain the discipline of formal collective decision-making. Then, as now, ministers sought to be open, transparent and accountable in respect of the decisions made.

Decisions were made by Cabinet or by ministers with appropriate delegated authority, and were subject to the scrutiny of the Scottish Parliament. Some decisions were delegated by Cabinet to the First Minister.

Formal records of decisions were kept, and decisions were communicated to the Scottish Parliament in oral and written statements, in the answering of Parliamentary questions, and in the participation of ministers in meetings of the Parliament and of committees.

Ministers received comprehensive briefing on the course of the pandemic, drawing on material from medical and scientific sources such as SAGE and the newly established Scottish Covid-19 Advisory Group; advice was presented by clinical advisers within the Scottish Government and bodies such as Public Health Scotland.

During the pandemic, careful note was kept both of the decisions made and of the supporting reasoning, information and advice and evidence. As required by statute, since 2013 the Scottish Government has had robust policies, plans and strategies regarding the management of records that are designed to ensure that there is a complete record of the business undertaken. The information that constitutes the record may take different forms or may be created in different ways. Regardless, the responsibility remains to ensure that such information becomes part of the record. In practice, this involves the transfer of information into one single location, the Scottish Government's corporate electronic document and records management system.

In summary, the Scottish Government's structures and systems that were in place throughout the pandemic were clear, logical and transparent. It is submitted that it resulted in governance and leadership that was both effective and efficient.

The third area I wish to look at is Scottish Government's strategies and decisions during the pandemic.

It became clear that the Scottish Government's response to Covid-19 would require a huge number of decisions to be made by ministers across government, at pace, and sometimes at short notice, with some decisions being taken by a more focused group of key decision-makers. The framework for decision-making published in April 2020 set out the Scottish Government's principles and approach, as well as its strategic objective to contain and suppress the virus so as to minimise overall harm it could do, taking into consideration the available scientific, clinical and public health advice.

A key part of the approach was the concept of four harms, of which we have heard already today. Broadly speaking, the pandemic and measures in response to it could cause harm in four areas, namely: harm 1, direct Covid health harms, that is primarily the mortality and morbidity associated with contracting the disease; harm 2, broader health harms, primarily the impact on the effective operation of the NHS and social care services; harm 3, social harms, that is the harms to our wider society, for example harm to education attainment as a result of school closures; harm 4, economic harms, that is harms to the wider economy.

The complexity of the systemic challenge posed by the rapid spread and evolution of Covid-19 meant that there was no single or individual correct response and few, if any, harm-free decisions open to governments, including the Scottish Government. The challenge was to assess risks and benefits and take decisions to reduce overall harm as much as possible.

The Scottish Government recognised that the four harms did not impact on everyone in society equally. Accordingly, inequalities were seen as a factor integral to the four harms. This approach was consistent with the aspirations of the Scottish Government, both before and after the pandemic, to build equality into policy making across all areas of government. It is also cognisant of its duties under equalities legislation and the need for all decision-making to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. Thus, equality impact assessments were used and published frequently during the pandemic. A great deal of work was done on this area. However, the Scottish Government does recognise that one of the key questions arising from the pandemic is: if, how and to what extent vulnerable and at-risk groups could have been better protected.

In broad summary, as both the nature of the crisis changed and the Scottish Government's overall strategy evolved in response, so too did its approach to imposing and easing non-pharmaceutical interventions. From the initial lockdown of March 2020 through to the lifting of the remaining legal measures on 18 April 2022, all steps were guided by consideration of the four harms. Thus, in 2020 and the first half of 2021, the priority was to suppress the prevalence of the virus, even in recognition that such an approach might cause broader harms.

May 2020 saw the publication of Coronavirus (COVID-19): Scotland's route map through and out of the crisis, which detailed four phases of exiting lockdown. The Scottish Government took a precautionary approach to the relaxation of the restrictions, conscious of the fragile position in relation to the suppression of the virus which would affect its ability to protect population health.

During September and early October 2020, a great deal of work was done to repress a resurgent virus. The focus was, insofar as possible, to manage, stabilise and reduce the transmission of the virus through careful and targeted use of NPIs.

In late October 2020, as the pandemic moved into a new phase requiring an enhanced NPI response, the Scottish Government published Covid-19 strategic framework. The strategic framework supported the overall approach, the overarching approach of taking decisions in the context of the four harms, but it gave the flexibility to put in place different measures in different parts of Scotland, if local and regional data supported that.

This levels framework was designed differently from those that applied elsewhere in the UK, such as the tier system in England. It was different both in terms of the NPIs included within each level as well as the number of levels. The levels framework proved capable of responding to outbreaks and new variants without the need for a further national lockdown in Scotland. By defining measures in advance, the levels framework enabled the Scottish Government to communicate in advance what it would ask people to do and why.

With the success of vaccines and the reduction in health risks to individuals, in particular older vaccinated individuals, the Scottish Government's strategic intent was adjusted. Ultimately in February 2022 the strategic intent was revised for the last time in recognition that, after two years of the pandemic and in light of developments in vaccines and treatments, a strategy that was overly focused on suppression of the virus would have a disproportionate impact on the other harms.

The fourth area that I would like to look at is working with other governments and local authorities.

Promoting and protecting the health of the Scottish people is a matter within the competence of the Scottish Parliament. Devolved control of the public health response by the Scottish Government was crucial to the effective handling of the pandemic in Scotland. At the same time, it was recognised during the response that there were areas in which it was vital to engage and work with the United Kingdom, Wales and Northern Ireland governments. Similarly, it was recognised from an early stage that effective working with Scotland's 32 local authorities would be vital in responding to the pandemic. Engaged participation with local authorities was forthcoming, for which the Scottish Government was deeply grateful.

It is worth noting that current devolution arrangements reflect the will of the Scottish electorate. Quite properly, nothing was done to reallocate the existing roles and responsibilities of the Scottish Government for public health in response to the pandemic. Indeed, the close connection between the Scottish Government's responsibility for public health and those for healthcare, justice, policing, education, local government and most public services were central to the response. What did happen was that liaison between the Scottish and UK governments was intensified, with an enhanced level of engagement between Scottish Government, Cabinet secretaries, ministers and officials and their counterparts in the UK, Wales and Northern Ireland governments.

Co-operation with the UK Government was on the whole reasonably effective. However, this is not to say that there is no room for improvement. For example, on occasion it appeared to the Scottish ministers that the UK Government treated certain fora as opportunities to inform the Scottish Government of decisions which had already been taken. This meant that meaningful discussion with the Scottish Government was sometimes absent in respect of UK Government decisions that affected Scotland.

There was no Scottish Government response to the pandemic which was guided by anything other than a desire to contain and suppress the virus in order to minimise the overall harm it could do. By working with the other governments of the United Kingdom, a commitment included within the framework for decision-making, Scotland was able to benefit from the best and most up-to-date expert scientific data and advice. This information helped to guide Scottish Government decisions, which were always made to meet the specific circumstances in Scotland.

Where the Scottish Government reached decisions that were different to those which were deemed appropriate in other parts of the United Kingdom, it did so after consideration of the facts and circumstances facing it. It is respectfully submitted that this reflects devolution working as it was intended. The result was decision-making that responded to local circumstances and that was accountable to an evolved legislature.

The fifth and sixth areas that I wish to look at briefly, my Lady, today are access to data and communication. They are substantive topics in and of themselves, and we deal with them in much greater depth in our written statement.

Scottish data played an essential role in the pandemic. Although there were difficulties in the early days of the pandemic accessing the data, the Scottish Government established quickly the Covid-19 Modelling and Analysis Hub, which was able to share externally produced modelling evidence and research, as well as produce a range of its own data and modelling. This went into co-ordinating advice to ministers in respect of the four harms.

The EAVE II study -- of which we have just heard from Mr Bowie for PHS -- was a unique resource, created through a collaborative partnership between Public Health Scotland, Scottish universities and public health physicians. Using data from 5.4 million people registered with a GP in Scotland, the study successfully tracked the pandemic in near real time, as well as the effectiveness of the vaccines across Scotland. The research of EAVE II produced findings that had a global impact on the response to the pandemic.

The final area is communication.

In respect of communication with the public, one of the aims of the strategy was to provide a form of ongoing support via a regular presence to assist people through a worrying and distressing period. The strategy was designed to reach the population of Scotland as frequently as possible, with accessible information that could be easily understood and would motivate and prompt life-saving action by adopting protective behaviours. A variety of different communication channels, such as daily briefings by the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, helped to explain why levels of public confidence were consistently high.

My Lady, those are the six areas that I wish to look at today. They are explored in much greater detail in our written statement, but for now I would close by saying that the Scottish Government is of course committed to learning and adapting as a result of the Inquiry's findings, and it is grateful to the Chair for the opportunity to make today's submission.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Mitchell.

Right, that completes the submissions of the core participants and Counsel to the Inquiry. We've covered a great deal of material today in summary form, and I'm indebted to Counsel to the Inquiry and to all the core participants' legal representatives for their submissions and for the focus which have enabled us to complete today's submissions in good time.

So thank you all very much indeed, and tomorrow we shall sit at 10 o'clock and start hearing the evidence.

**Mr Dawson**: Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.
