5. Submissions on Behalf of the National Police Chiefs' Council by Mr Phillips KC
=================================================================================

**Mr Phillips**: My Lady, as you know, I appear on behalf of the National Police Chiefs' Council, which is a national co-ordinating body representing UK police forces. And as again you know, the NPCC was a core participant in Modules 1 and 2 and it's worked to assist the Inquiry at every stage of the proceedings. Now, in this module, the NPCC represents the interests of the Police Service of Scotland, often referred to as Police Scotland, and the police in

Scotland, as in the rest of the UK, were one of the frontline organisations when it came to the management of the pandemic. Now, my Lady, in Module 2, you heard evidence from Martin Hewitt, who was the chair of the organisation throughout the pandemic. In this module, you won't hear from any police witnesses. However, you do have a written statement from Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Alan Speirs, who led the policing response to the pandemic in Scotland.

Now, Police Scotland established a formal response to the pandemic at a very early stage, with the setting up of Operation Talla in January 2020. Of course the policing scope of this module extends only to the issue of the enforcement of the Covid-19 regulations but, as you heard in Module 2, and as you will see again from the written statement I've mentioned, Operation Talla co-ordinated a far broader range of work over the course of the pandemic. Its portfolios included the critical task of maintaining core policing functions, supporting the criminal justice system, establishing procedures for the collation and analysis of Covid-19 data, and finally procuring, delivering and training staff in the use of PPE.

But so far as enforcement is concerned, again you've already heard evidence about the central importance of the NPCC's four Es guidance -- engage, explain, encourage, enforce -- its importance to policing in England and Wales, and that holds equally true for policing in Scotland, which adopted the same guidance in March 2020.

Throughout the pandemic, the constant messaging, both within Police Scotland and by Police Scotland to the public, was that enforcement was the last resort, to be used only when the first three Es had been exhausted.

In Module 2, you may remember Martin Hewitt explained that for police officers engaging with the public on these restrictions, it was compliance and not enforcement which was the measure of success. As he said, in a public health context, it's compliance which prevents transmission and keeps the community and indeed the police safe.

My Lady, in my closing submissions for Module 2, I made the point to you that when it comes to the enforcement of the Covid regulations, the police response cannot fairly be assessed solely by reference to the number of FPNs issued, because that omits all the encounters which successfully achieved compliance. I noted then that the overwhelming majority of police engagements began and ended with those first three Es.

In Module 2A, that submission is reinforced by the data published and produced by Police Scotland because, recognising the critical importance of gathering and analysing data to track the progress of the pandemic, in April 2020, Police Scotland created a bespoke computer system called CVI to record every Covid-related encounter between the police and members of the public, and the data that was collated on that system was published on a weekly basis and was then analysed in a series of independent reports by Professor Susan McVie from the University of Edinburgh in order to ensure transparency and accountability, and that data shows that approximately 88% of all encounters were able to be resolved by officers using one or more of those first three Es without any need to progress to enforcement.

So in this context, where the measure of success is achieving public compliance with the regulations to prevent transmission, the data shows, I would suggest, that the four Es guidance was effective.

My Lady, it was a priority for Police Scotland to ensure that, in the small proportion of cases which resulted in enforcement, officers were acting appropriately and within the scope of the powers granted to them under the novel and evolving public health regulations. So, to that end, Police Scotland established the Independent Advisory Group on Police Use of Temporary Powers to provide oversight and also assurance. The IAG, as the group became known, met regularly between April 2020 and May 2022, and its purpose was to help the police to ensure that the powers conferred on them by these new regulations were exercised appropriately, lawfully and in compliance with human rights legislation. The IAG was wholly independent, was led by a respected King's Counsel, and it reported publicly and directly to the Scottish Police Authority.

In addition, Police Scotland undertook an extensive lesson-learning exercise during the pandemic in order to identify positive practices and ensure they were implemented for the future, and that exercise resulted in the production of an operational scoping report and, following the pandemic, a debrief project. The result of both those workstreams have been disclosed to the Inquiry in the hope that they'll assist you on the question of policing the pandemic in Scotland.

My Lady, one of the key lessons identified by that process is the immense benefit which was derived from collaborative working with third sector organisations and with representatives of vulnerable groups. It was clear from an early stage that the virus and the lockdown had the potential to cause real harm to persons with vulnerabilities, to children, to minority groups and to victims of abuse. So the dedicated liaison which was undertaken by Police Scotland during the pandemic, as described in TDCC Speirs' witness statement, helped to ensure that issues could be better identified and then addressed, that guidance produced in response was appropriate, and that policing actions were informed by those most affected.

My Lady, of course I understand that you have a vast amount of ground to cover in a relatively brief hearing, and I also acknowledge, as I did at the outset, that the question of enforcement is but a single sub-issue in your long list of issues -- I think it merited a single sentence in your counsel's lengthy opening earlier -- so it's right that the role of the NPCC in this hearing is necessarily limited. Nonetheless, the NPCC will seek to assist you in your work and provide insight into the pandemic from that policing perspective.

For example, Police Scotland worked closely with the Scottish Government throughout the pandemic. Again, you have the written evidence on this but, in short, for Police Scotland this was a collaborative and constructive relationship with both sides working towards the same goal: to prevent transmission and to keep the public safe.

My Lady, it's hard to overstate just how challenging the circumstances of the pandemic were, both for those on the front lines of policing who put their lives at risk and for senior officers who worked round the clock to adapt to new regulations and the evolving virus. My suggestion to you, my Lady, is that Police Scotland rose admirably to meet those challenges.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Phillips, very grateful.

Una Doherty King's Counsel. Is it "Doherty" or "Docherty"?

**Ms Doherty**: "Docherty".

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you. Sorry, I meant to check in the break and I forgot.

*(Pause)*

**Ms Doherty**: My Lady ...

**Lady Hallett**: Well, there's a green light on.

**Ms Doherty**: I've tried -- that's it now.
