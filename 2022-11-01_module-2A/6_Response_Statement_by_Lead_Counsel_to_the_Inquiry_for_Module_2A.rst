6. Response Statement by Lead Counsel to the Inquiry for Module 2A
==================================================================

**Mr Dawson**: I do have a few, my Lady.

I'm pleased to note that a number of the areas which were raised those who helpfully contributed acknowledged had been covered, to a certain extent at least, in my opening presentation.

There are a few matters on which I think I might helpfully add, and particularly mindful of the fact that there may be people watching who have not participated in previous hearings and so may not be entirely aware that some of these arguments have been ventilated before your Ladyship at the Module 1 and/or 2 preliminary hearings and a response given on behalf of the Inquiry. If I might take the presentations in turn. My learned friend Ms Mitchell made a number of submissions. There are three areas on which I think I can come back with what I hope are useful comments. The first relates to the submissions which she made on behalf of Scottish Covid Bereaved urging your Ladyship to consider greater involvement of core participants in the Rule 9 process. For the sake of those listening who may not have been involved in the hearings as much as Ms Mitchell has, similar submissions were made on behalf of the group which she represents, and indeed, as I understand it, a number of other groups, in particular at the hearing which your Ladyship presided over yesterday in Module 2.

I simply would adopt and repeat the submissions which have been made by Mr Keith in support of the Inquiry's position, and I would also add that it is important, of course, in the interests of fairness, that there be consistency in the way in which that matter is approached across all of the modules.

So therefore it would be appropriate for me to adopt the same arguments which he has already advanced in front of your Ladyship in Module 2.

The other matters which are raised, which I think I can address: the important matter was raised by my learned friend about the need to be vigilant about potential areas of overlap, both in a conceptual sense but also in a practical sense, with the Scottish Inquiry.

On the subject of the overlap between the subject matter being looked at in each Inquiry, I would simply add that the terms of reference are what they are. As I set out in my main presentation, the statutory consultation exercise was gone through when our terms of reference were fixed. They include a requirement now for us to look into and report on devolved matters which were within the competence of the Scottish Government, as much as on other matters within the Inquiry's remit. But I hope that those whom she represents are content with the commitment that we have given to take the obligation that we have to minimise duplication seriously. And as you know, my Lady, there are a number of discussions which are imminently about to be had with the newly constituted Scottish Inquiry about how best we might achieve that.

There is one further matter which I would wish to put on record. Ms Mitchell mentioned both the submission which she has made previously in connection with listening rooms, which of course has been noted and taken on board, but also on the subject of hearing venues.

As I have pointed out, the oral hearings in Module 2A will take place in Scotland in the autumn at some point of next year. Ms Mitchell and those instructing her have already been of considerable assistance in helping the Inquiry identify potential venues for hearings which might be suitable to their clients and more widely to the Scottish public, and I would wish to place on record that that spirit of collaboration is very welcome.

As far as the submissions made by Mr McConnell are concerned, I'm obliged for his clarification that matters which have been raised in the written material have, I think, all now been resolved to his satisfaction, and therefore I intend to add nothing further in connection with what he had to say on behalf of his clients.

As far as Mr Jacobs' submissions were concerned, once again a number of the submissions which were made have already been subject of some detailed discussion in previous hearings. He made a point which differed slightly substantively, although aligned itself with Ms Mitchell's point, about the need to consider further involvement of core participants in the Rule 9 process, and again I would simply align myself with the submissions made in that regard by my learned friend Mr Keith yesterday.

It is important also to note that the system which has been put in place, whereby updates will be provided to core participants, is designed, I think, precisely to try to achieve what it was that Mr Jacobs wanted, ie the ability of his clients and other core participants to participate meaningfully in the module, which of course is our absolute intention.

Another point which he made, again which I think was made and discussed in some detail at at least one previous hearing, related to the extent to which we need to look at the impact of Covid in various sectors in order to assess the reasonableness and timeliness of government interventions.

As I say, this is a point which was certainly raised and debated at the Module 2 PH yesterday, and I would align myself again with what Mr Keith had to say.

I think it's fair to say that we will need to examine to an extent the impact of Covid and of the decisions made by the Scottish Government in order to be able to analyse and assess their effectiveness and appropriateness. It is, I think, a feature of the modular structure -- which Mr Jacobs and the organisation which he represents otherwise considered to be the best way of structuring the Inquiry, and which has advantages, as I've set out in my main presentation -- that a detailed analysis of the impact in various sectors will need to wait until later in the Inquiry.

We will focus now on the decisions which were taken on the basis of the information which was available to decision-makers at the time. We, within the Inquiry team, are of the view that the current arrangements strike an appropriate balance.

He made a further suggestion, and indeed has provided some written submissions, in connection with the role which the Scottish TUC played in advising government. He has asked for a Rule 9 to be issued to the STUC in that regard. That is a matter which will receive imminent consideration within the Module 2A team. We are certainly obliged to the information which the STUC has provided through the written note and Mr Jacobs' submissions about their precise role, which is of considerable interest to us.

The final matter which he addressed, again which I'll return to, for the purposes of clarification with those who were not at earlier hearings, is the subject of there being a possible further hearing to which core participants may make further submissions in early 2024. This, again, was a matter which was raised by the TUC at the Module 2 preliminary hearing yesterday.

Of course, again, my answer to that is simply to refer to the comments made by Mr Keith to the effect that the Inquiry team could not make submissions at this stage on the desirability or benefit of a further hearing at that time.

The matter was, however, also covered by Mr Keith's general comment to the effect that there will be further reflection within the Inquiry team on points made by core participants at the Module 2 preliminary hearing and indeed today.

As I say, the same also goes for the points helpfully raised by the core participants in writing and at this hearing for Module 2A.

As far as Mr Mitchell KC's submissions are concerned, I don't think I have anything that I can usefully add at this stage, save to acknowledge our gratitude for the spirit in which the Scottish Ministers have intimated that they intend to participate in this Inquiry.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Dawson.

Right, well, that now completes the first preliminary hearing into Module 2A. I will give all the submissions very careful consideration. Even if they were similar submissions to ones made yesterday, they're important and they all deserve proper consideration in each module, and that's what they will get.

Unless anybody wishes to stay for this afternoon's hearing into Module 2B, Cymru, Wales, thank you very much for attending and that completes this hearing.

Thank you all.
