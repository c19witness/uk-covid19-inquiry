3. Submissions on Behalf of Nhs National Services Scotland by Mr Mcconnell
==========================================================================

**Mr McConnell**: Good morning, my Lady.

Yes, I appear for NHS National Services Scotland, my Lady. NHS NSS lodged written submissions which identified three matters. Those can be found at page 5 of the 23-page pdf bundle of the core participants' written statements for today.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Mr McConnell**: My Lady, I propose addressing very briefly each of the three matters that feature therein.

The first of those is duplication. Matters have in fact moved on since this written submission was lodged, in respect that yesterday I corresponded with and had a helpful discussion with Mr Dawson KC. He explained to me the position as per his submissions this morning and, in light of that, there is at present no need for any further discussion of the terms of the terms of reference or the potential need for a public statement.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr McConnell.

**Mr McConnell**: The second matter raised was the position and corporate statements. I note what was said this morning, which was helpful clarification. Obviously there has been further information provided about what is contemplated by the corporate statements, and at this end we simply need to consider that quite carefully and reflect on it. But the clarification is helpful.

The third matter is the practicalities, and most pressing of those is the question of dates and precise dates for the Scottish public hearing. I'm sure this is a matter which the Inquiry has relatively high up on its long list of priorities, but the point for the core participants, I'm sure all of the core participants, is that autumn 2023 is a relatively broad descriptor, it could be any time, I think, from September to November, and the sooner -- at least from NHS NSS's perspective -- an identifiable period of time is identified, the better.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr McConnell.

I do understand, I mean, words like "autumn" can be used by some to include, as you say, very long periods of time, and as soon as we have any greater certainty we will give you the details as necessary, because we do understand the burdens that Inquiries of this kind, the Scottish Inquiry, the UK Inquiry, place upon organisations that you represent. So thank you very much for your submissions.

**Mr McConnell**: Obliged.

**Lady Hallett**: Right. Mr Jacobs.
