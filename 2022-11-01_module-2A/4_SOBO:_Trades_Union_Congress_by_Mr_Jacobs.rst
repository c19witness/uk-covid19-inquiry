4. Submissions on Behalf of the Trades Union Congress by Mr Jacobs
==================================================================

**Mr Jacobs**: Good morning, my Lady.

With Ms Gallagher King's Counsel unable to attend today, I appear on behalf of the Trades Union Congress, the TUC. The TUC has been designated as a core participant in Modules 1, 2 and also 2A, 2B and 2C. My Lady, you will have heard this before, but for the benefit of others, the TUC brings together 5.5 million working people who make up its 48 member unions from all parts of the UK. The Scottish Trades Union Congress, which forms part of the TUC, represents affiliated membership in Scotland. The Scottish Trades Union Congress represents over 540,000 workers across 39 affiliated trade unions and 20 trade union councils. As Roz Foyer, the Scottish TUC General Secretary, has put it: "[The Scottish TUC] speak[s] for trade union members in and out of work, in the community and in the workplace, in all occupational sectors and across Scotland. [Its] representative structures ensure that [the Scottish TUC] can speak with authority for the interests of women workers, black workers, young workers, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender workers and other groups of trade unionists that otherwise suffer discrimination in the workplace and in society."

My Lady, we did file some written submissions last Thursday, but with the oral submissions of yesterday and also this morning, the ground has shifted somewhat and I propose to address you this morning on four issues.

The first is the provision of early information to core participants on the focus of the Inquiry's investigations, whether that be by way of disclosure of the Rule 9s, an early list of issues, or instruction to experts.

Second, issues of scope, and in particular the role of evidence of impact on Module 2A.

Third, to whom Rule 9 requests should be made.

Fourthly, and very briefly, the idea of strand-tying closing submissions after Modules 2, 2A, 2B and 2C have been concluded.

So, turning to my first issue, the provision of early information to core participants on the focus of the Inquiry's investigations.

My Lady, the Inquiry did, of course, hear from a number of core participants on this theme yesterday in Module 2. You were urged by a number of core participants to enable them to play an early and constructive role in the identification of the key issues and the evidence gathering process.

I do want to avoid simply repeating submissions you heard yesterday, but I do offer these short submissions by way of reflection in part on what was heard.

My Lady, it is important, in my submission, to understand why this issue is of such concern to a number of core participants. The scope of each module has been set out in very broad terms only.

Mr Keith King's Counsel yesterday described the terms of the identified scope as necessarily opaque. Perhaps Mr Keith was being a little unfair to the identified scope, but it is certainly right that with the breadth of the scope comes uncertainty as to what the Inquiry is actually investigating.

The Inquiry has been perfectly frank that it simply cannot investigate every issue and every event that might conceivably fall within the identified scope. That is for very good reason, and we don't seek to persuade you to do otherwise, but that does underline the point that all the core participants really know is that they cannot assume that any particular issue which might on its face fall within the identified scope is necessarily being investigated.

My Lady, the approach gives rise to two concerns. The first concern is that a core participant may only learn that a particular issue has not been investigated when it is too late, when the substantive hearing is so close that the gap in the evidence gathering cannot be filled without jeopardising the hearing date.

That concern is particularly acute for Modules 1 and 2, where the hearings are really no more than six or seven months away, but the concern also arises in this module, with hearings no more than a year away.

If we only see a list of issues when the evidence gathering process is close to its completion, given the complexity of that exercise, it will inevitably be some significant time away.

The second concern is simply that there will be an opportunity lost for the Inquiry to benefit from the experience and expertise of those bodies such as the TUC designated as core participants. Ms Mitchell, on behalf of the Scottish bereaved families, made the point yesterday that the Rule 9 process is necessarily informed by the knowledge base of those drafting them, and the Inquiry can benefit from the knowledge of the core participants, and that's a submission with which we agree.

Mr Keith King's Counsel did address this issue in his submissions in reply yesterday, and respectfully, my Lady -- and I hesitate somewhat because I'm conscious that Mr Keith is not here to respond --

**Lady Hallett**: Don't worry, he can take it, Mr Jacobs.

**Mr Jacobs**: I'm sure he can.

His reply was striking. His perceived difficulty with the disclosure of Rule 9 requests was that, on receipt of those Rule 9 requests, the core participants may feel compelled to say something about them. It would, he said, set a hare running.

My Lady, what Mr Keith describes quite simply is core participants being able to engage in a meaningful way with the direction of the Inquiry. To decline to disclose Rule 9 requests with the objective that core participants cannot then make any observations about them is misguided. It is misguided because core participants being able to engage with the Inquiry should be the objective, it's not the nemesis.

My Lady, there can also be some faith in the core participants, we say, and we sense, my Lady, that you do have that faith, and indeed Mr Dawson King's Counsel spoke this morning about fostering a collaborative approach, and we are with the Inquiry with that.

For our part, we doubt that any core participant wants to attempt drafting Rule 9 requests by committee of the Inquiry team and a number of core participants. But we say the core participants can be more constructive than that. We can focus on areas of inquiry rather than the minutiae of a request.

The Inquiry legal team is also, we would suggest, perfectly able and sufficiently assertive to rebuff any attempts, misguided attempts, by a core participant to draft by committee rather than focusing on real and significant areas where the Rule 9s can be strengthened.

It has been observed, my Lady, and it was observed again by Mr Dawson this morning, that disclosure of Rule 9 requests is not something that has necessarily happened in other inquiries, but this Inquiry is slightly different. In many inquiries what issues the inquiry is investigating is actually relatively straightforward. In this Inquiry, given its breadth, it's far from straightforward. There is a very significant issue which this Inquiry and its team has to grapple with, which is: what issues does it investigate?

It's of fundamental importance to, ultimately, the outcome of the Inquiry, and that's why in part core participants or many core participants are so anxious to have some input.

We do note, of course, that periodic updates are going to be provided, and that's welcomed, but as to that, if sufficient detail is provided in the updates to enable meaningful and constructive engagement, then we ask rhetorically: why not provide the Rule 9 requests themselves?

If, alternatively, the information does not really enable meaningful engagement and the opportunity for constructive comment, then it does not meet the concern.

The short point, my Lady, is this: the Inquiry is urged to engage with core participants early and as openly as possible, and core participants need to know at an early stage what issues the Inquiry is investigating, and we can then engage constructively.

My Lady, turning to my second issue, the issue of scope and in particular the role of evidence of impact in Module 2 generally and 2A in particular.

In our written submissions on scope, the TUC pointed to the importance of education as a sector being relevant to decision-making on the use and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions or NPIs, in part because schools could be vectors for the spread of infection.

We also emphasise that the use and effectiveness of NPIs played out in significant part in workplaces. Whilst many were working from home, the frontline -- and the real test of the effectiveness of social distancing, of masks and similar -- was in workplaces which did not close or did so only for limited periods. That was workplaces in sectors such as the transport sector, the communications sector, the manufacturing sector, in particular food processing and textiles, the construction sector and the retail sector.

We said in the written submissions that it would be important to understand how NPIs were applied and were effective or otherwise in practice.

We made similar points about public health messaging and guidance for workplaces and the implementation of workplace safety standards in bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive.

We observe that there may be significant overlap between what has been described as the early modules, the system modules and the later impact modules.

In fact, from what we understand particularly of what was said yesterday, that may not be the case, as it may be thought that the political decision-making, which is the focus of Module 2, can be investigated and examined without at the same time considering and hearing evidence as to how those decisions were playing out in practice.

Mr Keith King's Counsel explained that the task is to examine what consideration decision-makers had in mind and, where there is a gap, something that wasn't considered that ought to have been, that will be manifest.

We do struggle with that logic. First, it presupposes that we all know what the relevant considerations and disparate impacts were, and the task is simply to see whether decision-makers had them in mind. But, my Lady, we don't have that knowledge and that evidence. Some of the considerations and disparate impacts are now well known and obvious, but others less so.

No doubt the very reason the Inquiry is envisaging several later modules examining impact is to understand them.

Second, these weren't decisions made by the devolved governments in the abstract, they were decisions with real world perceptible and obvious impacts, and those impacts should of course have fed back into decision-making.

To take some concrete examples within the TUC's focus, the high mortality rate of bus drivers, the outbreaks of the virus in food processing plants, the emerging relationship between school attendance and community transmission, and many similar issues, should have fed into decision-making around NPIs and also reflection on and adjustments to public health messaging and guidance.

To take an example given by Mr Dawson King's Counsel this morning, in August 2020 it was known that there was a higher proportion of deaths in care homes in Scotland. The question then is how that fed into political decision-making, which is the concern of this Inquiry, and this module in particular.

My Lady, we want to be in the business of constructive and practical solutions rather than simply pointing to problems and challenges. We absolutely recognise the value in a modular approach, and a modular approach was possibly the only realistic one open to the Inquiry. And inevitably issues between modules will overlap and the divisions between modules may not always be easy. We recognise that.

We recognise that you cannot hear all evidence as to the impact of decision-making in Module 2. What we do say is that you must have enough evidence as to impacts so that the issues falling within Module 2 have some all-important context. It may not be an easy task, but it can be achieved, we say, with carefully targeted Rule 9 requests.

The Inquiry at least has to start exploring the impact issues and have some evidence before it for the purposes of Modules 2, 2A, 2B and 2C to give some all-important context to the decision-making which is the focus of these modules.

My Lady, my third point, to whom Rule 9 requests should be made.

The Inquiry is invited to direct a Rule 9 request to the Scottish TUC, who will be able to give relevant and important evidence on the use and effectiveness of NPIs in workplaces in Scotland.

It may be of interest to you, my Lady, that the Scottish TUC met with the Scottish Government regularly throughout the pandemic. That included planning meetings twice per week between the Scottish Government and the Scottish TUC, as well as the Scottish TUC's lobbying efforts. That meant that the Scottish TUC had some influence in shaping Scottish policy, for example in the designation of key workers and steps taken to ensure guidance was followed.

You may find, in due course, that that represents an area of divergence from the approach taken by the UK Government, and may be of interest to the Inquiry when considering the processes of decision-making.

We do recognise that the Inquiry's starting point to address Rule 9 requests to the most central decision-makers is of course sensible, but in due course we invite a request to the Scottish TUC.

My Lady, it does appear to us that Rule 9 requests can also usefully be made of a number of professional bodies that played a significant role in cascading and adapting national public health communications into workplaces, but that, my Lady, is an issue which the TUC is giving some urgent consideration to, and we envisage writing to you in due course with, we hope, some constructive suggestions.

Fourth, and finally, yesterday we invited the Inquiry to hold what might be called some strand-tying closing submissions after the conclusion of Modules 2, 2A, 2B and 2C. Whilst it is important to have distinct modules for the UK, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, it will also be useful to have some opportunity to take a broader view of the evidence gathered in and heard in each of the modules, and to take a coherent view of the findings and lessons learned across the modules.

It was said yesterday that perhaps it's too early to consider this sort of issue. As to that, my Lady, we say this: there are many advantages to the modular approach, we endorse it, but there are of course some disadvantages, and one challenge is how the Inquiry ultimately ends at a coherent role, and we say that actually, rather than being too early to consider how that is achieved, it is important that it is given some early consideration.

My Lady, unless I can assist further.

**Lady Hallett**: No, that was extremely helpful, Mr Jacobs. Thank you for both your submissions and for the suggestions, and we will pursue them where appropriate. I'm very grateful.

**Mr Jacobs**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Right, I think we now have Mr Mitchell KC attending by Zoom.
