5. Submissions on Behalf of the Trades Union Congress and Wales Trades Union Congress by Mr Jacobs
==================================================================================================

**Mr Jacobs**: My Lady, these are the observations in closing

of the Trades Union Congress, the TUC, and the

Wales TUC. I appear with Ms Ruby Peacock, instructed by

Thompsons Solicitors.

From the perspective of the TUC and the Wales TUC,

looking through the lens of those who worked through the

pandemic, with a particular focus on those sectors in

which workers faced the greatest risk, the story of this

module is of the strengths of social partnership but

also of some ways in which workers in Wales were failed

in the pandemic response.

We start with social partnership and how we say this Inquiry should assess its contribution to decision-making processes of the Welsh Government during the pandemic.

In questioning of general secretary of the Wales TUC, Shavanah Taj, Counsel to the Inquiry went through a list of requests made of the Welsh Government by the Wales TUC and enquired about the extent to which each were actioned.

That was an entirely appropriate line of questioning. This Inquiry clearly and properly appears to have a tight focus on actions: what action was taken, what action ought to have been taken. But assessing the value and role of social partnership requires more than a narrow analysis of what was requested and what was therefore changed. Inputs and outputs in core political decision-making are multifactorial, a request made of the Government being answered may well be indicative of the value of social partnership, but a request being unanswered does not disprove its value.

Foundationally, social partnership is more than a mechanism for demands, it is about sharing views and seeking a shared understanding and approach. That enhances decision-making in direct but also indirect ways. It enables government to be more responsive to the needs of those at work, but also serves public confidence in the government, and there is clear evidence of that in Wales during the pandemic.

The health minister was accurate in his evidence when he explained that the Shadow Social Partnership Council was a good forum for sharing information and good practice and for the consideration, challenge and enhancement of policy developed in response to the pandemic. It gathered all the main stakeholders and helped to provide similar timing and consistency of message.

Social partnership, that pursuit of shared understanding, also avoids the distrust and attrition between government and stakeholders that can be so destructive of good decision-making. This Inquiry has not heard, in this module, of decision-making driven by a corrosive lack of trust between government and its partners. In contrast to the evidence in Module 2 in relation to the UK Government, the Inquiry has not seen a government in the mode of "no surrender to the unions", making bad decisions out of an instinctive desire to be oppositional.

None of that is to say, of course, that social partnership did not also have concrete benefits. The Inquiry has heard, for example, that there was an early engagement with a number of stakeholders, including unions, on issues relating to the disproportionate impacts upon black and minority ethnic groups. The key example was the Wales TUC's contribution to the health and social care subgroup of the First Minister's BAME advisory group to design a tool which could be used to assess the risk posed by Covid-19 in the workplace and help protect those at greater risk. It was used widely throughout Wales following its introduction in May 2020.

As we set out in our opening statement, the physical distancing requirement in the workplace in Wales was supported by concrete steps to ensure it was observed. It was introduced as a legal requirement on 4 April 2020 which formed part of a package of specific rules to support workplace health and safety upon which unions had had an opportunity to meaningfully engage. The equivalent provision in England was set out in guidance and only required observation of social distancing where possible.

In advance of the legal requirement coming into effect, the Wales TUC had advance notice of the provision, having been consulted on it, and had the opportunity to establish a whistleblowing hotline to enable workers to report breaches of the legal requirements.

In relation to financial support for self-isolation there are errors which we will come on to but there was also evidence of a responsiveness and an understanding, albeit belated, as to the need to support those continuing to attend work.

In the evidence of Rebecca Evans, there was at least some recognition that adequate financial support would likely have a positive impact upon suppressing transmission of the virus, and goes some way to ameliorating the unequal impacts of the pandemic.

That acknowledgement and understanding, to a point, contributed to the pandemic response. The self-isolation support payment was increased to Â£750 in August 2021, a change reflecting an understanding of how the scheme was operating on the ground and the fact that there remained a financial disincentive for self-isolation.

There is also some evidence that, via closer partnership with local authorities, the scheme in Wales was a more accessible one.

A further concrete way in which Welsh Government responded to the repeatedly expressed concerns of social partners, including the Wales TUC, was the establishment of a social partnership group to report on the provision of PPE. As Shavanah Taj set out in oral evidence, this group enabled the Welsh Government to inform key partners about the stock levels of PPE, efforts being made to procure more, how PPE was being distributed and when further supplies could be expected.

Although this did not immediately resolve the supply issues, it was a reassuring avenue of communication which enabled social partners to further disseminate the information, ultimately offering reassurance and increasing public confidence. It contributed to improvements at least in the provisions of PPE.

However, it is clear that notwithstanding some of the advantages of social partnership, there were key areas in which workers in Wales could have been better supported. The context is not just the many who lost their lives, but also those who suffered trauma in responding to the pandemic, and the many who suffered and continue to suffer from Long Covid.

First, PPE delivery. In his opening remarks, Counsel to the Inquiry reflected upon a message sent by the health minister to himself recording the observations of a Welsh hospital consultant: complete chaos at our hospital, no protection for nurses, very low morale, :outline:`masks` not being released.

This account is reminiscent of the reports unions were receiving from frontline workers, not only those in healthcare, but in social care and the many other sectors which continued to work at the early stage of the pandemic, notwithstanding the difficulties they were facing in accessing PPE.

In her evidence, Shavanah Taj described the instance where the Wales TUC was contacted by the husband of a mental health nurse who had been in physical contact with a patient who had later tested positive for Covid-19 but had not been wearing PPE, due to an assumption during the early stage of the pandemic that it was not necessary in that setting for PPE to be worn.

So the issue was not only scarcity of supply, but also of inadequate workplace guidance on the circumstances in which PPE was required.

In the instance involving the mental health nurse and in relation to many other reports of lack of access to PPE in the workplace, Wales TUC was able to convey that report to the relevant organisations and action was taken to resolve that individual case.

However, lack of access to PPE and accurate guidance regarding its use was an issue which, although it gradually improved, required numerous interventions, as Ms Taj explained in oral evidence, it was an area where the Wales TUC felt they had to keep pressing the Welsh Government, although it is right to acknowledge that significant progress was ultimately made.

Second, though the provision of financial support for self-isolation had its strengths from the Welsh perspective, it also had its failures. This was more than a matter of fairness. Poor adherence to self-isolation placed an upward pressure on the R rate, and so it was a matter of keeping that R rate under control.

Self-isolation was a means of suppressing the R rate which did not have the awful impacts of measures such as closing schools, and that was all the more reason for it to have been a focus. It was also an issue that affected those on lower incomes in high risk jobs had already faced poorer health outcomes, and so it was also a matter of taking measures that lessened some of the disparate impacts of the pandemic.

The UK Government was far too slow to respond to this issue, with a financial support scheme not introduced until September 2020. But in Wales the response was even slower. In Wales the main financial support scheme was brought in a month later and eight months after self-isolation was introduced as a key NPI.

Tellingly, countries that properly supported self-isolation did better, South Korea being an example. Surprisingly, Mark Drakeford was dismissive of the idea that lessons could have been learned during a pandemic from such countries, suggesting that the differences were a feature of different cultural norms. We don't agree. Supporting self-isolation, as an example, made just as much sense in Wales and there were no cultural barriers to doing so.

In response to questions, the Minister for Finance and Local Government Rebecca Evans accepted that she would have wanted to provide financial support sooner and further accepted that the point of the Barnett guarantee in July 2020 could have been a point at which financial support was introduced. That at least is welcome.

The third, my Lady, relates to those working in the social care sector. The need in Module 6 of this Inquiry to consider the structural problems within social care is ever clearer. It is striking, for example, that the health minister saw it as government going above and beyond its role in an unprecedented way to take any steps at all to support the provision of PPE to those in social care. Perhaps that may be right, but it shows the void that needed to be filled.

In a similar vein, in turning to try to address some of the demands in the social care sector, the Welsh Government did not have even the starting point of knowing who the providers of care were. As the First Minister said in his evidence, there was no single register of where every care home in Wales is located.

This was all reflected in the oral evidence of the chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association, Dr Chris Llewelyn, who explained:

"... there was a general sense that the needs of social care staff as a whole weren't being taken into account ... there was a sense within the workforce that they were being neglected ..."

And:

"... an issue of parity of esteem with other healthcare workers."

The Wales TUC encountered significant difficulties advocating on behalf of social care workers. As Shavanah Taj explained in her evidence, it requested that Welsh Government utilise the consequential funding from the infection prevention and control fund introduced in England in May 2020 to provide equivalent funding for care sector workers in Wales, but as of October 2020 still did not have a clear explanation as to the cause of the delay.

There has been evidence, my Lady, in this module about the sensitive topic of ingress of the virus into care homes and the most significant route being via care staff. The narrative that sees care staff merely as vectors of the virus is one, my Lady, that looks through the wrong end of the telescope. It will inevitably compound the feeling in the sector of staff being undervalued and unappreciated.

Particularly with asymptomatic transmission, care staff carrying the virus is unavoidable, so the question is: what could have been done about it? The narrative should be one that asks why it is that we have a care sector serviced by so many in insecure work, working across several homes; why so little was done to support the sector in restricting movement of staff between homes; why was there not better PPE to protect both staff and residents?

Those are the relevant questions, my Lady, not: did care staff carry the virus?

The fourth relates to enforcement of health and safety in the workplace. The Wales TUC found consistent evidence that a significant number of employers failed to take sufficient infection prevention and control measures during the pandemic. There was a dearth of proper enforcement, both by Health and Safety Executive and by local authority enforcement health protection officers. Inadequate funding of bodies able to enforce health and safety standards in workplaces has resulted in enormous reductions in the occurrence of in-person workplace inspections and enforcement actions. There is a desperate need for enforcement to be adequately resourced.

As a result, many workers faced unsafe conditions during the pandemic and had very little recourse to report workplace health and safety issues other than to their union representatives.

Concluding, my Lady, it is unquestionably the case that these features of the pandemic response, and no doubt many others, gives rise to a need for robust recommendations and lesson learning by government. It is hoped by my clients that the Welsh Government will take forward your recommendations with the benefit of social partnership to ensure that the planning benefits from the experiences of frontline workers who were in the thick of the pandemic response.

My Lady, those are the closing remarks of the TUC and the Wales TUC. They have been grateful for the opportunity to contribute in this module of the Inquiry.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Jacobs.

I think the next speaker is Mr Allen, who's attending remotely, I think. Mr Allen.
