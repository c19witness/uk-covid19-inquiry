9. Submissions on Behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations by Mr Dayle
===================================================================================================

**Mr Dayle**: Thank you, my Lady.

I act on behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations, FEHMO, and I am instructed by the firm Saunders Law. My leader is Mr Leslie Thomas KC, who is presently out of the jurisdiction, and who means no discourtesy for not being here today.

Let me start by introducing my client group. FEHMO is a multidisciplinary consortium of over 55,000 individual members and 43 organisations and networks, advocating on behalf of black, Asian, and those minoritised as ethnic workers in the healthcare and social care sectors.

We represent a broad spectrum of workers, including doctors, nurses, care workers and hospital support staff, people who, as it were, worked tirelessly on the front lines, who worked selflessly on a daily basis, putting their lives at risk despite the known and the unknown dangers of the Covid virus.

Many have suffered. Some paid the ultimate price of caring for others with their own lives.

FEHMO was conceived during the Covid pandemic with its initial aim being to bring to light the disproportionate impact of the disease on its members.

In the long term, the consortium seeks to provide a united voice against systemic and underlying health inequalities across all the nations of the UK.

The disproportionate impact of Covid on black and brown people is now an indisputable fact. The contemporaneous reporting told the devastating story. April 23, 2020, the British Medical Journal headline stated "Two thirds of healthcare workers who have died were from ethnic minorities". May 25, 2020, The Guardian headline similarly stated "Six in ten UK health workers killed by Covid ... are BAME". June 8, 2020, British Vogue asked the obvious question: "Why Are So Many Health Workers from BAME Backgrounds Dying of Covid-19?"

For this Inquiry, my Lady, these early, dire headlines raise serious questions about government decision-making. Why? Despite concerns and known statistics on higher prevalence and severity amongst ethnic minority groups, public health recommendations specifically targeted towards ethnic minority groups at the time were limited. Why? Why was there no proper system of recording infection levels based on race and ethnicity? This was so despite the obvious and rising number of casualties as the disease progressed. Why? When the obvious was becoming clear that black and brown communities were being disproportionately impacted, there was still a lack of timely action to provide better protection.

FEHMO submits that for this Inquiry's commitment to placing possible inequalities at the forefront to be properly and adequately realised, there must be due consideration of how institutional and structural racism affects health outcomes.

As the Macpherson Inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence found at paragraph 6.3 of that report, which no doubt my Lady is very familiar with:

"... the concept of institutional racism which we apply consists of ..."

And it goes on to say:

"The collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin."

And it goes on further:

"It persists because of the failure of the organisation openly and adequately to recognise and address its existence and causes by policy, example and leadership."

Structural racism as been defined in the Du Bois Review, an academic journal, as the:

"... macro-level systems, social forces, institutions, ideologies, and processes that interact with one another to generate and reinforce inequities among racial and ethnic groups."

For example, historical experiences of minority ethnic groups and long term discrimination may lead to a higher proportion working in lower paid jobs on insecure contracts without sickness benefits and in public-facing occupations, living in crowded housing conditions, and having fewer resources for health.

FEHMO members have had to conduct their professional duties whilst suffering with higher levels of infection, mortality, bereavement, physical and mental burn-out, and sadly nowadays the spectre of long Covid.

They seek answers on the government's apparent failure to: one, provide appropriate PPE to health and social care workers in a timely manner; two, keep proper epidemiological data and map progression within BAME communities; and three, put in place proper public health measures to protect BAME health and social care workers.

In the terms of reference, one need not remind you, my Lady, that this Inquiry has committed itself to consider any disparities evident in the impacts of the pandemic on different categories of people.

FEHMO believes it bears saying at this point that this Inquiry must investigate whether government had any regard to the public sector equality duty throughout its decision-making. Was this duty ignored during the pandemic, or was there a suspension of these obligations within the respective decision-making apparatus?

My Lady, we have no illusions about the enormity of the disclosure exercise that is required for this module. It is for that reason that, on the matter of scope, we join the call inviting the Inquiry to provide a list of issues at an early stage with the opportunity for CPs to comment on them, and I believe those arguments have been canvassed by my colleagues previously.

We acknowledge Mr Keith's promise to reflect on this issue in his earlier remarks this morning. We also seek to join the call of those inviting you to direct that Rule 9 requests are shared with CPs in the interest of transparency.

Notwithstanding Mr Keith's nuanced discussion on this point this morning, we believe that the opportunity to comment on Rule 9 requests would assist your investigation by addressing gaps that have not been covered in the Inquiry's own requests.

On the subject of expert witnesses, we welcome Mr Keith's promise in his written statement for the Inquiry to "consider suggestions from [core participants] as to who should be appointed" as experts. As we noted in our written submissions, FEHMO considers it vital that the Inquiry has the benefit of expertise on matters of health inequality, race and ethnicity, and intends to make further representations in this regard.

We also endeavour to make sure or we will also endeavour to make sure that generally on the matter of choice of experts across all disciplines, the Inquiry works along with experts who have previously in their work engaged with these issues.

Finally on the matter of the Listening Exercise, my Lady, FEHMO has considered the arguments advanced by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, and the position set out by the Inquiry. Without rehearsing the finer points of this debate, we want to say that we are somewhat sympathetic to the arguments that have been advanced by CBFFJ and Mr Weatherby this morning, and indeed Ms Davies.

The process of obtaining stories for a report to be produced by a party outside of the Inquiry, we submit, seems too far removed and beyond the juridical process of this Inquiry.

On the matter of pen portraits, we appreciate Mr Keith's comments on the work being undertaken to commemorate the experiences and losses of victims of Covid-19 from within the Inquiry, and we look forward to updates as this work progresses.

Those, my Lady, would be our opening remarks at this time.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Dayle, very helpful.

Just on that last point about the Listening Exercise, my intention at present, and obviously I am keeping every issue under review, is to make sure that individual experiences are fed into the Inquiry in two way: one as direct evidence in the Inquiry hearings where they relate to possible systemic failings and are therefore plainly relevant to that particular module, but secondly, also, that the Listening Exercise is not intended to be just, you know, an add-on. The reports from the Listening Exercise of people's experiences will be fed into the Inquiry as evidence. So it's not removed from the juridical process -- sorry, I can never say that word -- as you were perhaps suggesting. It is intended to be very much part of the process.

**Mr Dayle**: Very well.

**Lady Hallett**: So thank you very much for your very helpful submissions.

**Mr Dayle**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Right, Ms Gallagher.

Ms Gallagher, I'm just pausing for a second because I interrupted you last time. I have been asked to break every hour and a quarter. We started at 1.45 to 2, so I think you should be all right.
