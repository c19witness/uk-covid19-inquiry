6. Submissions on Behalf of Just for Kids Law, Save the Children UK and the Children's Rights Alliance for England by Ms Twite
===============================================================================================================================

**Ms Twite**: My Lady, I represent Just for Kids Law, Save the Children Fund and the Children's Rights Alliance for England. I'm instructed by the in-house legal team at Save the Children.

Those children's rights organisations make a joint application for core participant status and they are jointly represented at this Inquiry.

At the outset they wish to clarify that they are grateful to this Inquiry to be designated as core participants and, further, for the acknowledgement that you gave when designating them as such of the specific impact that the Covid-19 pandemic had on children and young people.

By way of, I hope, a brief introduction to those organisations, we wanted to acknowledge that today's generation will forever be the Covid generation. Sorry, I meant to say today's children will forever be the Covid generation. The impact on them goes far beyond the closing of schools and other education settings. At times, the practical effect of the lockdown rules meant that children were prevented from seeing others their own age, even when adults were allowed to meet friends from other households. During the first lockdown, while outdoor exercise was allowed for adults, there was a lack of clarity about whether children could play, and fences went up around playgrounds. Soft play centres were among the very last places to receive guidance about re-opening.

Many of the non-pharmaceutical interventions which affected everyone, disproportionately affected children. Six months in the life of a 12-year old is vastly different to that of a 28-year old; children's lives were turned upside down at crucial stages for their development. And there were many specific impacts, such as children who were awaiting trials in the criminal justice system, many turned 18 and lost protections that would have been afforded to them when they were children.

Despite this and many other impacts that I don't have time to go into, children were not systemically identified as a vulnerable group requiring additional support to cope with restrictions. And the impact on children, the rights of children, were not considered adequately or even at all in many key decisions.

The children's rights organisations I represent today spent the pandemic both directly supporting and working with children affected by such matters that I have just addressed, as well as advocating for their voices and their rights to be heard by government.

For example, Save the Children Fund, which is the UK member of the Save the Children movement, launched the emergency response programme to support families, following which they published a report drawing on the experience of over 7,000 families with children aged between 0 and 6 years old.

Just for Kids Law provided legal representation and advocacy support to children and young people on many issues throughout the pandemic, including those arrested for breaching Covid laws and kept in police stations, those whose cases were delayed, those who faced homelessness and those who had insufficient support from their local authorities. They also campaigned for children to be treated distinctly by the court system, by the Department for Education, and in respect of the lockdown rules.

Just for Kids hosts the Children's Rights Alliance for England, a membership organisation with over 100 members from across the children's sector. The Children's Rights Alliance and its members were also campaigning for children's rights to be considered in particular through the use of children's rights impact assessments.

These organisations share a concern that the children's voices were not heard and that children's rights were not respected. That concern in particular was highlighted when the initial draft of the terms of reference to this Inquiry were published. Those terms of reference did not initially include a reference to the impact on children and young people.

My Lady, you undertook a public consultation and, as a result of that, you recommended that the terms of reference were updated, one of those recommendations being that the impact on children and young people be included, which they were.

And the children's rights organisations now hope to assist this Inquiry and your team in assessing the issues as regards children within the pandemic.

I will address you briefly, if I may, on four specific issues, the first of which is the scope of the Inquiry.

We addressed our submissions on scope in paragraph 14 of our written submissions, and the proposed scope for this module has six individual parts. Our primary submission throughout is that the rights and the impact on children run through each and every one of those parts. And we give some examples of how children's rights are connected to those considerations before this Inquiry in our written submissions, which I don't repeat here.

I do make it clear that our submissions deal with examples of how children were impacted; they're not intended to be an exhaustive list of the matters that relate to children that will need to be considered in this module. We expect that the rights of children, and indeed other groups, many of whom's rights are represented by other core participants here today, should be incorporated in key decisions at every stage.

We did not ask in our written submissions that the rights of children are explicitly stated or set out in the scope, and that was partly out of a concern that if children are added as an extra point to consider, that may have the unintended effect of undermining rather than strengthening their importance, because they may become an additional consideration at the end rather than an integral consideration at the heart of the decision-making.

We note that some core participants have taken a different approach, and in particular, my Lady, you have received submissions on behalf of the Covid-19 Families for Justice and the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Families for Justice. At paragraph 7(d) of their submissions they suggest adding to the scope by questioning which vulnerable groups were considered and they list those potential vulnerable groups.

We certainly agree that these are important considerations for the Inquiry, and we note that Mr Keith indicated this morning that the team will reflect upon those submissions. Were you minded to amend the scope in such a way as to spell out these vulnerable groups, we submit that children and young people should be added to that list.

But whether or not the scope is amended or whether, as has been proposed by others, a list of issues is created, we simply ask that children and young people are considered in any such list and that it is clear in the scope or in the list that these are not a separate consideration but at the heart of every decision, and essentially we are neutral as to exactly how that is put in terms of writing the scope.

The second point is about the scope of further modules. Other core participants have stated it would be useful to know the shape of future modules, and we are grateful to Mr Keith for providing further information about those future modules this morning.

In addition to doing so, he stated that further detail as to the further scope cannot be given at this stage, and we do appreciate the difficulties in doing that.

However, we only ask for thought to be given as to how the issues in this module will overlap with future modules and how they will be dealt with in this matter.

For example, the lockdown included the shutting of schools and Mr Keith confirmed this morning that this module will consider the economic and social impacts on a number of matters including education, and we simply ask how those considerations will interact with future modules on education, and have similar questions about modules on courts and prisons and children and young people which are also of concern to the organisations that I represent.

We note further representations have been made about this by the TUC in their submissions, and we endorse the submission that this needs to be given some further consideration.

Thirdly, I come to the Rule 9 requests. In our written submissions we didn't take issue with the proposal that a Rule 9 request would not be disclosed to the core participants, which was in line with your ruling following the Module 1 hearing. However, having considered the matter further and taken further instructions, we do support the submissions made by other core participants that the Rule 9 requests themselves be disclosed.

As I stated, we do acknowledge your ruling on Module 1 but we endorse the submissions made by Mr Weatherby that, given Module 2 has quite a different focus, it is certainly open to the Inquiry to make a different ruling, and I don't repeat the submissions made quite ably by Mr Weatherby on that point already.

There are two points we wish to make. Firstly, we endorse the submissions that you have already heard at length, and I don't repeat, by other core participants, in particular regarding transparency and the practicality of such. Save for, I do want to pick up the point made by the Southall Black Sisters and Solace Women's Aid. In their written submissions at paragraphs 11 and 12, they state that the government failed to consider the impact on women and girls in their decision-making, and they go on to make the point that omissions are hard to identify, and it makes it all the more important to be able to see the Rule 9 requests, to ensure that nothing is missed.

The same point is true for children. It's very much the case that a lot of decisions simply did not consider the impact on children and, therefore, the children's rights organisations will wish to draw attention often to what is not said or not considered. Essentially, we will be trying to show a negative.

Mr Keith has told you about the impracticability of simply asking for everything, given the number of documents that must be relevant in an Inquiry such as this, and we are told that disclosure will be targeted and we accept that may be necessary.

The difficulty that arises from that is that the Inquiry will need sufficient disclosure to make proper inferences as to matters that weren't considered as well as to matters that were.

Mr Keith did acknowledge this in his submissions to you this morning and indicated that there will be sufficient disclosure to ensure that such points can be made, and we're grateful for that indication and the fact that that's very much a matter that the Inquiry team are alive to.

Our simple point is that we can assist with ensuring that Rule 9 requests cover sufficient disclosure to make these points that we are concerned with, and that we may be in a position to assist the Inquiry team in these matters, given these are matters that the children's rights organisations have been working on for some time.

And further, that if we wait for the disclosure that we are told will come, it may well cause delay because it may mean that the children's rights organisations are making points later in the process that could have rightly been made earlier on.

The second point I wanted to make on the Rule 9 requests is this: the children's rights organisations, along with other core participants, have made specific submissions within their written submissions about what Rule 9 requests should be made, such as who should be asked for -- sorry, which organisations should receive Rule 9 requests, and have sought clarification as to whether or not certain requests or certain lines of inquiry have been pursued.

We will no doubt make more such inquiries. For one example, we support the request for equality impact assessments to be asked for, and we would also ask that children's rights impact assessments, which can't simply be substituted by an equality impact assessment, also be asked for from government departments.

But we find ourselves in the position where we don't know whether such requests have already been made, or maybe something similar has been asked for, or something else has been asked for that makes our request less relevant to the questions of this Inquiry. And our submission is that it is potentially more work for a core participant to be second-guessing what the Inquiry team are doing and checking whether the Inquiry team have -- whether a certain line has been pursued, than it would be simply to see what has been asked for and make further suggestions based on that.

Mr Keith quite rightly said this morning that the core participants should not attempt to duplicate the inquisitorial role of the Inquiry team, and I wish to assure the Inquiry team that the core participants have no wish to do so but simply to assist the team, but it is difficult to do so blind.

The fourth point and final point I wish to address my Lady on is about the Listening Exercise. The intention behind the Listening Exercise is very much welcomed by the children's rights organisations. It is fundamentally important that children's voices are heard as part of that, especially given our concern that children's voices have been very much lost within this pandemic.

It is, I am sure, an obvious point, but there is a particular urgency for hearing children's voices. Everyone's memories are fading but especially younger children will find it increasingly difficult to contribute meaningfully as time passes. In order for children to take part, it will also be necessary for some children to have support, especially younger children or those with additional needs. That does not need to be legal representation, and in fact we endorse the Inquiry's approach that this be a non-legal process.

At this stage this is really a request for information. And I know we were reassured this morning that more information is coming, and we are grateful and welcome that. In particular, we want to know how children will be encouraged and told about the Listening Exercise, how they will be supported to take part. Of course, that cannot be one answer for all children, there will be different answers for children in different age groups and those with different backgrounds and characteristics. There will be children who are particularly hard to reach. We are particularly keen that children in custodial settings get their voices heard, many of whom during the pandemic were locked in cells for 22 and a half hours a day. But we also ask for confirmation from your Inquiry team that children will be engaged and supported to take part in this process.

So we ask at this stage for conversations with your Inquiry team to happen quickly, given the urgency for engaging children that we have outlined, and emphasise our willingness to engage and collaborate with your team on how to plan for and support children and other young people in this.

The organisations I represent do engage with and support children and young people and assist them in engaging with government decisions at many levels, and so we offer our support in that matter, and indeed our willingness to engage on all issues in this Inquiry or aspects of the Inquiry as matters arise.

Those are the submissions on behalf of the children's rights organisations.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Twite. You made some excellent points, as indeed everybody has to date.

As far as the detail on subsequent modules is concerned, at the moment my hope is that by having children's rights organisations involved in this module and then having later modules which deal more specifically with the impact on children and young people, we can ensure that we do investigate, that I investigate fully and properly every -- all the impact upon children and young people. We will give you as much detail as we can as soon as we can, and I'm sorry there is not more available, but I'm afraid I have been making some pretty dreadful impositions on the Inquiry team so far and they do need to get the odd hour's sleep, so I promise you we will get to it as soon as we can, because I appreciate how much it would assist you to know -- and others, indeed -- what's going to be dealt with here and what's going to be dealt with there. But we will give you information when we can. May I also say, having dealt with children's memories in another role, you make an excellent point about the fading of children's memories and the Listening Exercise, one that I confess I hadn't thought about until you mentioned it, and I will make sure that we look into that immediately. So thank you very much indeed.

**Ms Twite**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Right. Who is next? Disabled people's ... yes, please, Ms Sivakumaran. Please tell me how to pronounce your surname. Mr Lavery quite rightly did.

**Ms Sivakumaran**: It's Sivakumaran, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Sivakumaran, thank you very much.

Right. Now, are you speaking all together for the two organisations you're representing?

**Ms Sivakumaran**: Yes, that's the intention.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.
