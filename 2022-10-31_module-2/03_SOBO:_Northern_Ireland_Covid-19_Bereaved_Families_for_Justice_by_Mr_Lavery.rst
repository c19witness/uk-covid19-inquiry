3. Submissions on Behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Lavery
=====================================================================================================

**Mr Lavery**: My Lady, as your Ladyship knows, I represent the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, and we have -- as we set out in Module 1 preliminary hearing, we are collaborating very closely with the overall group, and Mr Weatherby and I and our team have produced a joint submission, so I'm not going to add to anything that Mr Weatherby set out this morning. I wanted to introduce myself and the team at this stage.

What I said in the Module 1, my Lady, was I looked very briefly at unique factors relevant to Northern Ireland, and I gave a list of those, and I'm very sure that those will be the subject of consideration in Module 2C.

There is some overlap, though, into this module. One of those unique factors is the success or otherwise -- probably otherwise, I say with no sense of pride -- of devolved government in Northern Ireland. And we have had over a sustained period of time either no Assembly, no functioning Assembly, or, at best, a form of mandatory coalition which, depended on a commentator, does or does not work, and here may not be suitable in the longer term.

So that is a feature of disfunctionality of government, for whatever reasons -- we won't get into those -- of Northern Ireland, but it has an impact, we say, at a central government level in terms of what the awareness is of that, what contingency is made for that, what response there is to that and, indeed, how one deals and responds to that ongoing disfunctionality. We're even responding to a more acute breakdown of devolved government in Northern Ireland.

So these are all issues which may well be looked at as part of 2C, may well be looked at as part of this module. I know that Ms Gallagher, as part of the TUC submission, specifically addresses the lack of government in Northern Ireland for a period of three years immediately preceding the pandemic, and I was assured this morning by Mr Keith that that will be properly looked at as part of Module 2C, and we welcome that and we'll continue -- I will, with Mr Keith and Ms Dobbin -- about what falls into 2 and what falls into 2C, and we'll collaborate hopefully closely on that basis.

Lastly, my Lady, one other aspect that will probably fall more into Module 2 is the relationship between central government in London and Dublin, when one is looking at the island as one epidemiological unit. What exchange was there between the two governments that deal with the land border and what exchange of information, what collaboration was there, and of course the common travel area.

So that's all I want to say this morning, my Lady. And, as I say, we hope that the collaboration that we've seen already will evolve into greater -- to make sure that you, my Lady, aren't faced with any omissions or gaps in the scope of the Inquiry.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Lavery, that's very helpful. And thank you for any contributions you made to the written submissions, I'm very grateful, I shall bear those issues very much in mind.

Thank you.

**Mr Lavery**: Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Williams.

For those who have to come from the deepest corners, we are trying to work out how to configure the hearing room so you don't have to come from the darkest corners.
