Transcript of Module 2 Preliminary Hearing on 31 October 2022

*(10.00 am)*

**Lady Hallett**: Good morning, everyone.

This is the first preliminary hearing into Module 2 of the Covid-19 UK Inquiry.

Module 2 -- and Mr Hugo Keith King's Counsel will expand upon this in a moment -- is looking at and making recommendations upon the UK's core political and administrative decision-making in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic between early January 2020 and February 2022, when the remaining Covid restrictions were lifted.

I have received a number of written submissions in relation to this module, and in a moment I shall invite Mr Keith, first of all, and then any core participants who wish to make oral submissions to elaborate upon the written submissions.

Can I just say this: I don't wish to take up unnecessary time, because we've got a lot to get through, but I'm extraordinarily grateful to the core participants for their written submissions. They were helpful and they were constructive, and I very much appreciate the offers of support and close co-operation expressed within them.

So thank you to everybody who took the trouble to submit those written submissions.

I'll now call upon Mr Keith to outline the issues that we have to consider this morning.

Mr Keith.

1. Statement by Lead Counsel to the Inquiry
============================================

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, by way of brief introduction, I'm going to start by setting out the arrangements for today's hearing, and then introduce the core participants. Some of what I will say will repeat what I said at the preliminary hearing into Module 1. Because this is a different module with necessarily different issues to be addressed, and a significant number of new core participants, it's necessary to set out some of the matters again.

Starting with the arrangements for this hearing, the proceedings are of course being recorded and live streamed to other locations. This has certain benefits. First, it allows the hearing to be followed by a greater number of people than would able to be accommodated within the hearing room or any overspill rooms; second, and in accordance with section 18 of the Inquiries Act 2005, my Lady, you're obliged to take such steps as you consider reasonable to ensure that members of the public are able to attend or see and hear a simultaneous transmission of the proceedings. Live streaming goes a considerable way to satisfying this obligation.

May I say straightaway also that one of the core participant groups has reminded us of the need to review whether any reasonable adjustments are required to be made to the transmission of proceedings, and we'll of course review matters going forward in light of what they have said.

Also, as is routine in public inquiries, where there may from time to time be matters mentioned of a potentially sensitive nature, the broadcasting of the hearing will be conducted with a three-minute delay. This provides the opportunity for the feed to be paused if anything unexpected is aired which should not be. We do not expect any such matters to arise over the course of today.

Let me then turn to representation. Present today, whether in person or remotely, but excluding myself and the Inquiry legal counsel and solicitor team here, are counsel and solicitors representing 39 core participants. All are, therefore, legally represented and I don't propose, my Lady, to read all the names out.

Then turning to the core participants themselves, they know who they are, but I should explain that they are entities, organisations or persons with a significant legal interest in Module 2 and who, therefore, have enhanced rights to participate in this process.

Each of the core participants appearing before you was granted this status by you under Rule 5 of The Inquiry Rules 2006.

By way of overview, the Inquiry received 75 applications, some made jointly, for core participant status. Of these applications, 39 have been designated, some jointly, as core participants. They are as follows, and there is, my Lady, no significance in the order of names that I will read out:

The UK Statistics Authority; Scottish Covid Bereaved, formerly known as the Scottish Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice; Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice; Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru; Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Group; Care England; the Homecare Association; and the National Care Forum; Long Covid Kids; Long Covid SOS; and Long Covid Support; Save the Children UK; Just for Kids Law; and the Children's Rights Alliance for England; Solace Women's Aid; and Southall Black Sisters; disabled people's representatives organisations, comprising the Disability Rights UK, the Disability Action Northern Ireland, Inclusion Scotland and Disability Wales groups; the National Police Chiefs' Council; the Office of the Chief Medical Officer; the Secretary of State for the Home Department; the Welsh Government; the Scottish Ministers; the Executive Office of Northern Ireland; the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; the Cabinet Office; the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development; His Majesty's Treasury; the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care; the Government Office for Science; the Local Government Association; and Welsh Local Government Association; NHS England; the Trades Union Congress; the British Medical Association; the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations; the UK Health Security Agency; and Imperial College.

My Lady, you know, of course, that core participant status brings significant procedural advantages. The core participants get access to the disclosed documents, they will make submissions on the course and the mechanics of this Inquiry, they will raise specific questions and assist us in ensuring that the Inquiry discharges the formidable duties imposed upon it.

I need to say something about the nature of those duties, given the public interest in these proceedings, and the nature of the issues that Module 2 will be enquiring into.

In the very briefest of outlines, Module 2 is concerned with how, in overarching terms, central government responded to the pandemic and made the key decisions that it did, concerning matters of central importance such as the decisions to impose lockdowns, how and why did it make those core decisions, how well did the system work.

You have resolved, and I repeat the resolution today, that the Inquiry will enquire into these momentous decisions and events thoroughly and rigorously. It will ensure that the facts are properly revealed. It will identify plainly wrongful decision-making, and significant errors of judgement, but it will acknowledge what went well. And most importantly, it will ensure that lessons are identified so that they may be properly learnt for the future.

The bereaved and those who have suffered are absolutely entitled to no less.

In this unprecedented and vast and difficult undertaking, the Inquiry team will need the insightful and sensible assistance of all the core participants, and I wish to record also the Inquiry team's gratitude, alongside your own, my Lady, for the contributions reflected in the written submissions.

A key consideration in this module will be whether those who stood to suffer particular disadvantage because of the pandemic and the steps taken to deal with it were properly identified by the government, and whether the likely impact on them was sufficiently assessed.

We welcome, therefore, particularly, in addition to the bereaved family groups, the assistance of those core participants representing the interest of those sectors of society and groups who were likely to be particularly affected by the government decision-making: the disabled; the vulnerable; the elderly; children, particularly those at risk or in care or with particular needs; women and girls against whom violence and domestic abuse was perpetrated; those with chronic mental and physical health needs; members of ethnic minority communities; and, not least, long Covid sufferers, who ask whether the risks that eventuated in their case were properly considered. And it's for those reasons, my Lady, that you have appointed the representative organisations that you have.

To aid the better recollection, if it be needed, of the devastating impact of the Covid pandemic and to reinforce the utter seriousness and extent of the Inquiry's task in examining in Module 2 the decisions that the government took, it's necessary to set out the briefest of chronologies of the early stages of the pandemic.

My Lady, as your opening statement recalled, in late December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, in China. A new strain of coronavirus was subsequently isolated on 7 January 2020. It was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2.

On 21 January 2020, the World Health Organisation published its Novel Coronavirus Situation Report - 1. It recorded that, as of the day before, 282 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV had been reported from four countries, including China, Thailand, Japan and the Republic of Korea.

On 30 January, the second meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared a public emergency of international concern.

The virus and its associated disease, Covid-19, spread rapidly. On 15 February 2020 France recorded the first official death in Europe from Covid-19. By late February, the number of cases of Covid-19 outside China had increased thirteenfold, and the number of affected countries had tripled.

A worldwide public health emergency ensued, and on 11 March the WHO declared Covid to be the first coronavirus pandemic.

As few on this planet will be unaware, Covid-19 has killed millions of people worldwide and infected many millions more. Globally, as of 26 October of this year, there have been over 625 million confirmed cases of Covid-19, including over 6.5 million deaths, all these reported to the World Health Organisation.

Some estimates of death put the estimated number of deaths attributable to Covid, that is to say not just those reported, at tens of millions.

The pandemic has led to financial and economic turmoil. It has disrupted economies and education systems, and put unprecedented pressure on national health systems. Jobs and businesses have been destroyed and livelihoods taken away. The disease has caused widespread and long-term physical and mental illness, grief, and untold misery. Its impact will be felt worldwide, including in the United Kingdom, for decades to come.

As everyone here will recall, on Monday, 23 March of 2020, the Prime Minister announced severe restrictions on the entirety of the United Kingdom in what became known as the first national lockdown.

My Lady, I don't propose to say anything more about the events leading up to that cataclysmic moment in the life of the United Kingdom. For this preliminary hearing it's not required and the detail of those events will, of course, be a matter for you in due course.

But we recall that vast swathes of human and social activity were ordered to be drastically curtailed and much of public life was halted. People were instructed to stay at home except for certain very limited purposes, such as to shop for essential items, to carry out one form of outdoor exercise each day, for medical needs, to provide care to a vulnerable person, or to travel to and from work if absolutely necessary and where that work could not be done from home.

Almost every area of public life across all four nations, including schools, the transport system, the justice system and the majority of public services were adversely affected. The hospitality, retail, travel and tourism, arts and culture, and sport and leisure sectors effectively ceased to operate. Even places of worship closed.

While the numbers of deaths rose inexorably, the NHS, the police and the emergency services and other key workers continued in their places of work. Almost everyone else was forced to work or to be educated from home.

The months that followed saw death and illness on an unprecedented scale. The latest government figures, my Lady, calculate that in the United Kingdom there have been around 180,000 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Beyond the individual tragedy of each and every death, and the devastating effect on the bereaved, it is clear that the pandemic placed extraordinary levels of strain on the UK's health, care, financial and educational systems, as well as on jobs and businesses.

The pandemic reached out and affected almost every person in the United Kingdom one way or another. But the hardship and suffering was not equally spread. For many it meant confronting the risk of infection or worse at the coalface: in hospitals, care homes and on the frontline of the public sector.

For others, it meant the loss of employment or of a business, or of worsening health, or an increase in the daily struggle, the struggle with financial worry or home care or poor living conditions.

So societal damage has been widespread, with unmet health needs, damaged educational prospects, financial insecurity, exacerbated inequalities and access to opportunity significantly weakened.

The disease is still with us, of course. There were 625 deaths involving Covid-19 registered patients in the United Kingdom in the week ending 14 October 2022.

The cost in human and financial terms of bringing coronavirus under control has also been immense. Government borrowing and the cost of procurement and of the various job retention income, loan, sick pay and other support schemes has severely impacted public finances and our financial health. The impact on the NHS, its operations, its waiting lists and its elective care has been similarly immense.

So, my Lady, this Inquiry has been constituted to investigate, on behalf of the bereaved and those who have otherwise suffered, as well as the wider public, whether anything could have been done to reduce that loss and suffering.

Only in this way can proper and effective recommendations be drawn up to protect the country better in the future from pandemics, whether caused by a coronavirus variant or some other form of disease, and also from comparable civil emergencies.

Given the sheer extent of the impact of the pandemic and the government decision-making that was required across such a very wide range of areas, it is little surprise that this Inquiry will be no less complex and multifaceted.

My Lady, may I then turn to say something about the commencement of the Inquiry, so that its legal foundations and legal scope can be properly understood and the work that you have already done be brought to public attention.

On 12 May 2021, the then Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons in which he announced that there would be a public inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005. He stated that it would examine the UK's preparedness and response to the Covid-19 pandemic and learn lessons for the future.

On 15 December 2021, as the sponsoring minister, he appointed you, my Lady, as Chair of the Covid-19 Inquiry.

In his written appointment letter, he confirmed that he would be consulting with ministers from the devolved administrations. This is important, because such consultation is required, by section 27 of the Inquiries Act, to enable the inclusion in the terms of reference of an Inquiry for which a United Kingdom minister is responsible, of anything that would require the Inquiry to determine facts and make recommendations wholly or primarily concerned with a Scottish matter or a Welsh matter or a transferred Northern Ireland matter.

Draft terms of reference were drawn up making clear that the Inquiry would consider and report on the state's preparations and response to the pandemic, and would therefore consider both reserved and devolved matters relating to the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

On 10 January, you wrote to the Prime Minister recommending certain amendments to ensure greater clarity in the Inquiry's remit. You also sought an express mandate to publish interim reports so as to ensure that any urgent recommendations could be published and considered in a timely manner.

In addition, given your view that the Inquiry would gain greater public confidence and help the nation to come to terms with the pandemic if it was open to the accounts that many people would wish to give, you suggested adding explicit acknowledgement of the need to hear about people's experiences and to consider any disparities in the impact of the pandemic.

On 4 February the Prime Minister responded accepting, with some minor caveats, the detailed changes that you had proposed.

On 10 March, having consulted with the ministers from the devolved administrations in the way that I've described, the Prime Minister wrote to you to inform you of certain further changes to the draft terms of reference which had been made in response to some comments from the devolved administrations.

Then the consultation process commenced, because on 11 March you wrote an open letter to the public in which you announced the launch of a public consultation process on the Inquiry's draft terms of reference. The Inquiry issued a consultation document seeking the public's views on whether the Inquiry's draft terms of reference covered all the areas that they thought should be addressed, and on whether the Inquiry should set a planned end date for its public hearings.

The consultation was open to everyone, and the public could contribute on the Inquiry's website by email or in writing.

You consulted widely across all four nations, visiting towns and cities across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and speaking in particular to a number of the bereaved. In parallel, the Inquiry team met with representatives of more than 150 organisations in round table discussions, covering themes such as healthcare, business, equality and diversity and education in young people, among others.

In total, the Inquiry received over 20,000 responses to the consultation, of which over 19,000 were received through an online consultation form.

An independent research consultancy was commissioned to analyse the responses and produce a comprehensive independent report. This summarised the respondents' views and the key themes that emerged from the consultation process.

In light of those views, my Lady, you recommended a number of significant changes to the draft terms of reference, and you wrote to the Prime Minister recommending those changes.

It's important that I emphasise: they were accepted in full.

Accordingly, on 21 July, the Inquiry was formally opened and you announced the decision to conduct the Inquiry in modules. Module 1, dealing with preparedness and resilience, was opened on 21 July, and the preliminary hearing into that module took place a few weeks ago.

This module was opened on 31 August, when its provisional outline of scope was published.

As I will explain a little further in a moment, Module 2 will consider and make recommendations about the UK's core political and administrative decision-making in relation to the pandemic between early January 2020 until the Covid restrictions were lifted in February 2022.

This module will pay particular scrutiny to the decisions taken by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, as advised by the civil service, senior political, scientific and medical advisers, and relevant Cabinet subcommittees. And it will do so with particular scrutiny to the period between early January and late March 2020, when the first national lockdown was imposed.

Because, as I've said, this Inquiry is obliged under section 27 of the Inquiries Act and its terms of reference to consider both reserved and devolved matters in respect of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, having considered the picture from a UK-wide and also English perspective in Module 2, Modules 2A, 2B and 2C will address the same overarching and strategic issues from the perspective of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. So the preliminary hearing in those modules will take place tomorrow and on Wednesday.

The public hearings in Module 1 and Module 2 will take place in London. Modules 2A, 2B and 2C will take place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland respectively.

My Lady, many of the core participants in their written submissions have asked for detail of what will come thereafter.

Module 3 will consider the impact of the Covid pandemic on healthcare systems in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It will examine the capacity of healthcare systems to respond to a pandemic and how they evolved. It will consider the primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare sectors and services and people's experience of healthcare during the pandemic. It will examine healthcare-related inequalities, core decision-making, and leadership within the healthcare systems. And the matters that you have directed will be inquired into will include staffing levels, critical care capacity, the establishment and use of Nightingale hospitals and the use of private hospitals, the 111, 999 and ambulance services, GP surgeries, hospitals and cross-sectional co-operation, healthcare provision and treatment for patients with Covid-19, palliative care, the provision of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including the use of Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation instructions (DNACPRs), the impact of the pandemic on healthcare staff, communication with patients, shielding, the impact of the pandemic on the clinically vulnerable, and the post-Covid condition referred to as "Long Covid".

Later modules, details of which will be published in due course, will address, putting it very broadly, vaccines, therapeutics, antiviral treatment, the care sector, government procurement and PPE, test, tracing, government business and financial responses across the United Kingdom. And then later modules still will look at health inequalities and the impact of the pandemic on education, on business and the self-employed, on children and young persons, on courts and prisons, on the public services and key workers. It will also address -- or they will address hospitality, retail, tourism, arts, culture and sport.

The request from one of the core participants for yet more detail can be answered, I'm afraid, only in this way: that is as much detail as can sensibly be decided and set out at the moment.

I then turn to this module. The documents setting out the provisional outline of scope for Module 2 has been published and I don't propose to read it out. The focus is on the really significant decisions that formed the response to the pandemic: the non-pharmaceutical interventions, the lockdowns, working from home, the reduction of person-to-person contact, social distancing and the use of :outline:`face coverings`.

You intend to investigate how and why the major decisions were made; what factors were taken into account in making those key decisions; what was the scientific and medical evidence upon which those decisions were based; were they the right decisions insofar as we can tell?

We will consider the timeliness of those interventions, whether there were viable alternatives, whether different decisions might have produced different outcomes. We will investigate what the driving forces of those momentous decisions were. Why did the Prime Minister and senior ministers decide what they did?

Some of the issues, my Lady, might be posed as questions, but I emphasise that these are but a handful of the areas that you will be looking at, and different issues may also come to the fore as we move through the process.

But in relation to the structures and effectiveness of the central government bodies tasked with responding to the pandemic, such as COBR, the COBR committee, Cabinet committees, the ministerial implementation groups, SAGE, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies and so on, some relevant questions might be these:

How effectively was SAGE utilised by central government? What improvements, if any, could be made to SAGE or the way in which central government uses it? Can lessons be learnt from the structures in place in other countries for the provision of scientific advice to policymakers? How effectively were these government structures resourced and staffed? Was their membership sufficiently transparent? How well did government departments assist and co-operate with the specialist committees?

Was the system of government medical and scientific advisers effectively utilised? How effective was the decision-making system under which the Prime Minister and other ministers acted on the advice and recommendations of the relevant bodies and advisers?

Did the system allow properly for timely political decision-making? Were decision-makers able to understand and interrogate scientific advice sufficiently?

What lessons were learnt from the way in which advice and recommendations were given and decisions made and responded to? And what was the extent of the co-ordination between the United Kingdom Government and the devolved administrations?

Access to and use of medical and scientific expertise, including data and data modelling, is an important matter at the heart of this module. So did key decision-makers have sufficient and proper access to reliable data and data modelling? Was there sufficient professional breadth and diversity of personnel? Were there any disciplines that were underrepresented on the committees? Was international experience sufficiently represented?

Did the committees have relevant and accurate data? How effectively was data described through the government? How reliable was the infectious disease data modelling? Did the data modelling cover the right eventualities? Was there an over-reliance on epidemiological modelling or mathematical modelling? Was there a over-reliance on influenza epidemiology and data modelling in the advice that was provided?

To what extent were factors such as the economy, non-Covid-related health concerns, education, mental health and societal issues considered when these momentous decisions were taken?

Were there any decisions in relation to which scientific advice was not sought but which ought to have been?

So we will examine the initial strategies relating to community testing, the movement from contain to delay, the broad and early guidance given to healthcare providers, the issue of herd immunity.

And then, in relation to the lockdowns and other restrictions, you will enquire into the effectiveness of the mandatory lockdowns in controlling the transmission of Covid-19 and the relationship between the timeliness and the length of the lockdown and the trajectory of the disease.

How were economic and societal impacts, including the impacts on physical health, healthcare provision, mental health, education and societal wellbeing, assessed and weighed in the balance?

Perhaps, my Lady, the single most important question: is it possible to say what the likely effects of earlier or different decisions to intervene would have been; the counterfactual proposition? Bluntly, would lives have been saved if the lockdowns had been imposed earlier or differently?

You will be enquiring also into the identification of at risk and other vulnerable groups and the assessment of the likely impact on them of the pandemic decision-making in light of those existing inequalities. Was there a failure to adequately recognise that chronic illness and/or disability was an outcome for the pandemic?

Then, public health. You will be enquiring into public health communications in relation to the steps taken to control the spread of the virus, the effectiveness and the reach of government messaging. Was the declared policy of "following the science" a fair reflection of the actual decision-making?

You will be enquiring into the maintenance of public confidence in the government strategy and decision-making, and you will be looking at the impact of alleged breaches of rules and standards on that process and on the maintenance of public confidence.

My Lady, I have taken those issues at a pace. Their scope is, of course, hugely ambitious, but it's necessarily provisional because it's neither practical nor advisable to identify at this stage all the issues that will be addressed at the public hearing.

The key, my Lady, must be to keep our focus on understanding the effectiveness of the core decision-making process; what worked, what didn't work and what are the lessons that must be learnt?

A number of the core participants in their written submissions have made helpful suggestions concerning scope. They've identified certain changes that they propose you should make in the direction of the Inquiry and this module, or they have specified particular areas for investigation. There are particularly helpful suggestions in the submissions from Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Group and the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice submissions.

Some have also called for a draft list of issues.

My Lady, the Inquiry will reflect, of course, on all those submissions. May I just make a number of points as to how we propose to do so.

First, the Inquiry will approach all those suggestions with an open, indeed eager frame of mind. It serves no purpose whatsoever to expend the time, energy and cost in designing and holding this Module 2 hearing only for issues of real importance not to be explored.

But, second, the scope document is only a generic guide. The actual scope and the issues and questions that will arise for scrutiny at the public hearing can only be assessed by reference to the material gathered under the Rule 9 process.

Third, as you said in your opening statement in July, with such a wide scope, the Inquiry will have to be ruthless in its selection of issues and relentless in its focus on matters of real importance. You cannot examine every issue, even if thematically within the reach of Module 2, and nor can you call every witness relating to every event, every issue or every major decision.

In the context of this module, Module 2, the focus is on whether the government had sufficient regard to the likely impact of the pandemic and its decision-making, not on what the impact of its decision-making turned out to be.

One core participant has called for a commitment that the Inquiry will examine whether the government had due and proper regard to the public sector equality duty. In summary, those subject to that duty must:

"... have due regard to the need to:

"(a) eliminate [unlawful] discrimination, harassment, [and] victimisation and ... other conduct prohibited by ... [the] Act ..."

Also, the need to "advance equality of opportunity", and to "foster good relations between [people] who share a ... protected characteristic and [those] who do not".

Of course, you will be asking questions about the extent to which the government adhered to such duties, but that is an evidential issue and it serves no purpose for the Inquiry now to try to set out, let alone guarantee, what it will ask and what it will not.

May I then turn to the Rule 9 requests.

Since the start-up date of 21 July, a huge amount of work has been done in terms of resourcing and staffing the Inquiry, setting up the legal teams, identifying hearing venues, responding to public communications and setting Modules 1 and 2 on their way.

The Inquiry has already issued formal requests for evidence under what is known as Rule 9 to the following organisations for the purposes of this module, Module 2.

The Cabinet Office, Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, the Department of Health and Social Care, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer, the Government Office for Science, SAGE, Independent SAGE, the Home Office, His Majesty's Treasury, the Department for Education, the Department for Transport, the Department for Levelling Up, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, the UK Health Security Agency, and NHS England.

Those Rule 9s are lengthy, complex and wide-ranging, and I'm greatly indebted to the counsel team, solicitors and barristers alike, for Module 2 for their industry and focus in drafting those documents.

As a result, we will receive many tens of thousands of documents for this module alone. And I need to say that in the case of the major government departments, it's clear from the initial responses that tens of millions of documents could be potentially responsive to the outline of scope if one went by the overall theme identified for Module 2.

In respect of the Cabinet Office alone, the required reviews of its own mass of documentation have been estimated as being likely to take over three years. The Inquiry would then itself have to review all that material prior to disclosure being given to the core participants.

Such a process if put in place would lead to an unconscionable delay in the Inquiry's timetable, and render impossible your stated determination to produce timely recommendations.

So with respect to the central government providers, the Inquiry has adopted a targeted approach. For this module, by which, rather than requiring all the documents potentially relevant to a theme or an area to be provided, it has instead sought documentation relevant to the key narrative events, the decision-making procedures, to particular bodies and persons, and the decisions relating to the key political and administrative decision-making.

Some of the core participants, my Lady, have asked: how will we know, therefore, whether you will receive the relevant material? The answer is plain: we ultimately decide what the key narrative events and decisions are; by making detailed requests, then scouring the first responses for events and decisions worthy of investigation, and by harvesting all the other material that we receive to make sure those are the correct decisions, we will bear down on what matters.

So we assess, my Lady, that the targeted approach will lead to the disclosure of what is potentially relevant. We are not limiting what is potentially relevant or how that is to be defined. We are instead identifying at an early stage what the real issues are to which the documents may be potentially relevant, and we do so by reference to dates, to people, and events, rather than by warehousing that documentation.

To assist the process, may I also say that we are asking those Rule 9 recipients for chronologies, for corporate statements and the flagging of particularly important materials. Disclosure statements will be requested, so organisations explain the approach they have taken, and we can dip sample materials to check against those explanations.

My Lady, may I emphasise, however, that we just can't ask material providers to give us everything they hold about Covid. Common sense dictates that would be an impossible request, and an impossible task to achieve. It would take too much time and be self-defeating. Too much disclosure is as bad as too little.

But may I, to give a brief example, give some detail of the sort of documents we've requested from, by way of example, the Cabinet Office.

We have sought agendas, minutes, and other documents associated with the core decision-making forums, such as Cabinet meetings, COBR meetings and ministerial implementation groups. We have asked for ministerial submissions, Number 10 daily briefing documents, records of written and oral advice to ministers, and details of internal communications, including WhatsApp group, which included the Prime Minister, Number 10, and other senior officials.

I should also say that the formal Rule 9 requests that the Inquiry has made amount to only one element of the ongoing process of discussion between the Inquiry and those organisations, the purpose of which has been to ensure that the requests we make are as efficient as possible in capturing material and setting the timescales.

My Lady, the long list that I gave of recipients of those Rule 9 requests also included members of SAGE, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, and Independent SAGE, the group of scientists, but a group that was unaffiliated to government, who worked together to provide independent scientific advice to the United Kingdom Government and the public.

Let me say a little more about those requests.

As you know, the membership of the scientific advisory body SAGE and its subcommittees comprised -- and comprises -- both civil servants and independent scientists. The Inquiry has sent Rule 9 requests to very nearly all of the independent scientists who sat on those committees during the pandemic, 199 individuals in total.

They were asked to provide amongst other things a summary of their involvement in this work, their views as to whether the committees on which they sat succeeded in their aims during the pandemic, and more generally their reflections on lessons learnt and recommendations for change that the Inquiry should consider making.

Similar requests have been sent to all members of the Independent SAGE committee, and we have received responses to a large proportion of those asks.

The Rule 9 requests continue weekly. They are being issued on an iterative basis and further requests will be made in due course.

Rule 9 requests will be made to civil society and special interest groups, representative bodies of local authorities, further scientists on SAGE, as well as independent scientists, certain witnesses from the People's Covid Inquiry, first ministers from the devolved administrations and other ministers attending UK Cabinet meetings, Chief Medical Officers, Deputy Chief Medical Officers, scientific advisers, senior officials in Public Health England, NHS England, senior civil servants, certain political advisers, and then the then Prime Minister and other key ministers.

So of course we will give consideration to the further suggestions made by the core participants, including those made by the Southall Black Sisters and Solace Women's Aid, those made by the disabled people's organisations and by the Trades Union Congress.

But the net that we have cast is already an exceptionally wide one.

Turning to disclosure of those requests, which is an issue which has been raised by a number of the core participants.

Disclosure to the core participants of those Rule 9 requests is neither required by the rules nor generally established by past practice. We submit that their disclosure would serve little purpose, given that the core participants will get and see the vast majority of what the Rule 9 requests reveal. It is the documentary material that matters, not how it was asked for.

Moreover, given that almost all the Rule 9 requests will be superseded by and built upon further requests from the Inquiry team, disclosure of preceding requests serves, we assess, no purpose.

One core participant particularly concerned about whether the government may omit to identify certain areas which are of importance, including whether or not it considered certain risks and the impact of its decision-making on that particular sector, suggests that disclosure of a schedule of an itemised list of documents possessed by all the Rule 9 recipients would enable that core participant to identify where an issue should have been but was not considered by the government. We respectfully disagree.

Where the government failed to consider certain issues, such omissions will be apparent on the face of the documents and their internal submissions, those internal submissions relating to decision-making in issue.

So disclosure of lists of potentially relevant materials is not necessary to enable the core participants to make the forensic point that certain issues which should have been considered by the government at the time were not in fact considered.

My Lady, in your Module 1 ruling you ruled that disclosure of the Rule 9 requests would serve little practical purpose, given the wide scope and the detailed nature of the requests that are in fact being made, and we invite you to apply the same approach to this module, Module 2.

Turning next to disclosure to the core participants.

The core participants are of course entitled to disclosure of relevant documents in advance of the public hearing, so as to enable them to contribute meaningfully to the process. Plainly, to make sure that this Inquiry is in a position to disclose relevant material, we have to cast our net more widely when gathering it in. The Inquiry does this by asking document providers for material that is likely to be relevant to the issues that arise for enquiry.

But thereafter, it's neither necessary nor proportionate for the Inquiry to disclose every document that it receives or every request that it makes, or, of course, every piece of correspondence. That is not required, and it would hinder the Inquiry in the performance of its functions. It is not the function of the core participants to duplicate the inquisitorial task of the Inquiry.

In particular, the documents received from the document providers cannot be provided without a sift for relevance and for utility. Disclosure requires active management by the Inquiry. But I can give further details about the disclosure process that is being adopted, so that core participants can be further reassured.

As an Inquiry team, we propose to give regular disclosure updates in which we can report on progress which has been made in obtaining relevant documents, and we will do so at future procedural hearing or hearings.

Secondly, we don't propose only to provide core participants with documents relevant to themselves. Everyone will receive the same documents for that module.

Third, we'll provide all documents that the Inquiry has received subject, as I've said, to a relevance review, but also a de-duplication exercise and, third, redactions in accordance with the redactions protocol, so as to weed out irrelevant personal data, for example.

Fourth, there won't be a document protocol because I've endeavoured to set out today the Inquiry's general approach.

So disclosure is likely to be made in tranches. Experience has shown, my Lady, that the disclosure of documents as and when they're received makes for practically a more difficult task.

Some core participants have requested that document providers sign a statement explaining how they have secured the preservation of documents, how they have conducted their searches, and how they have satisfied themselves that they have complied in full with their duties.

I can say that each provider has been asked or will be asked to provide an account setting out details of how the documents were originally stored, the search terms used, or other processes used to locate documents, and the nature of the review carried out by the document provider.

So where the Inquiry has queries or concerns about a provider's processes for locating relevant documents, it will raise them, it will pursue them. And of course, as documents are reviewed and gaps identified, further documents will be sought.

My Lady, in the course of the preliminary hearing into Module 1, an issue arose in relation to the steps taken to ensure the preservation of documents. And I said on that occasion that the Inquiry secretary, Mr Ben Connah, had written to the Director General, Propriety & Ethics to the Cabinet Office to request the retention of records across government. The Director General had replied, setting out the steps that had been taken to ensure records relevant to the Inquiry were being retained. But may I assure you, and assure the core participants, that the Director General, Propriety & Ethics to the Cabinet Office has again written to government departments reiterating the requirement to ensure that all bodies within their ambit that exercise public functions, either within the department or wider via representative bodies, including local authorities, retain documents relevant to this Inquiry.

You also, of course, have the power to compel the production of documents, and there are provisions in the Inquiries Act which make it a criminal offence if, during the course of an Inquiry, a person does anything to alter or distort a document or intentionally destroys, suppresses or conceals one.

Finally on this topic, my Lady, there is the issue of whether or not there should be an obligation on document providers to submit a list of undisclosed documents, that is to say documents which aren't disclosed because they are not relevant.

It is, of course, a matter for you. In our submission, we do, however, ask rhetorically: to what end? It is for the Inquiry to determine whether proper disclosure is being made, what further areas should be explored, and whether documents are required to be produced. So the production of a document setting out everything that's not been disclosed would simply require an immense amount of further work to little end.

In the preliminary hearing in Module 1, you ruled that the production of a document setting out everything that has not been disclosed would require a very considerable amount of work for little practical gain. In your view, you ruled, this would not be consistent with the obligation to minimise cost to the public purse, and we invite you to apply the same analysis to Module 2.

The electronic disclosure system that will be used to provide documents will be Relativity, and we anticipate that disclosure will commence before Christmas.

Turning next to expert material and the instruction of expert witnesses in Module 2.

A significant number of experts and persons with recognised expertise are likely to be giving evidence at the public hearing as witnesses. However, the Inquiry will also appoint qualified experts in particular fields of expertise as experts to the Inquiry, and they will assist the Inquiry, either individually or as part of a group of such persons, by way of the provision of written reports and opinions and, where appropriate, the giving of oral evidence at the public hearing.

My Lady, those experts will have the necessary expertise and experience for the particular instruction. They will be independent and objective, and subject to an overriding duty to assist the Inquiry on matters within their expertise.

As the core participants will no doubt appreciate, the identification of suitable experts is not at all straightforward, given the public ventilation of views by many of the experts in their particular fields, and the fact that some of the best experts were themselves involved in the events under investigation.

There is also, it will be no surprise to know, a significant absence of unanimity of opinion on many matters.

However, we've started to draw up a list of provisionally suitable experts. Written reports will be shared with the core participants, and where there are significant differences of view or emphasis among the members of a group, that will be clear on the face of the reports themselves. And of course, disputes or differences of view can be tested during the oral hearings.

The Inquiry has provisionally identified a number of areas in relation to which witnesses are likely to be giving evidence on such topics, whether as witnesses of fact or as experts. And those areas are likely to include: the co-ordination of strategy and crisis management in central government; the governance and accountability of and the co-ordination between government departments; systems for measuring and the estimation of infections and deaths; registration of deaths; and the overall figures for infection and death; statistical methods in infectious disease epidemiology; mathematical modelling of the spread of the virus; transmission, infection, mutation, reinfection and death modelling systems. Also, the international comparison of modelling systems; data sharing in government and with regional and devolved administrations.

Finally, experts and lay witnesses with expertise will be asked to look particularly at the issue of government and public communications, and behavioural science, the impact of messaging in the maintenance of public behaviour.

On behalf of the Inquiry team, we welcome the identification by some of the core participants of other suitable areas, and we note the suggestions made by the Southall Black Sisters and the Solace Women's Aid group in particular. We will consider all the suggestions, bearing in mind the guiding principle that the appointment of experts to the Inquiry and their assignment to a group are matters exclusively for you.

I now turn to the question of the Listening Exercise, as to which, my Lady, you'll have seen that again some of the core participants have advanced submissions.

As foreshadowed in the terms of reference, the Inquiry is in the process of designing its Listening Exercise. That is to say, you have ordered that the Inquiry set up a way in which the experiences of bereaved families and others who have suffered hardship or loss can be heard and recorded, and that those experiences can be analysed and summarised before being admitted into the formal record of the Inquiry.

The summaries of what is heard via the Listening Exercise and that accompanying analysis -- and it is not just data and numbers -- will be fed into the public hearings for Module 3 onwards as evidence, as I have said, so that it can inform the Inquiry's understanding of the impact of the pandemic and the response and of the lessons to be learned. It will also, of course, be disclosed to the core participants.

My Lady, this will allow the Inquiry to understand the experiences of the pandemic from across the whole of the United Kingdom, including from those most affected, but also those whose voices are not always heard. It will provide an opportunity for people to have their voices heard by the Inquiry without the formality of giving evidence or attending a public hearing, so that everyone who wishes to do so feels able to contribute to the Inquiry.

My Lady, the process which you have instructed to be done will reach vastly more people than could ever be accommodated by the giving of evidence in public hearings.

So the exercise aims to hear from a broad range of people, including the bereaved, but also those whose health has suffered from the disease, long Covid sufferers, those living with disability or health problems, the clinically vulnerable, and those whose family life, education, jobs, health, well-being and livelihoods were significantly affected.

It's obviously important that the Inquiry gets the design and structure right, and the Inquiry will start piloting different approaches for the Listening Exercise very shortly. This will include the Inquiry introducing, in November 2022, a new part of its website which will invite people to share their experiences. With thanks to the many members of the public, including bereaved families, who have already provided feedback, progress has been made on this online option.

Then, later in the winter and into the spring, a pilot in-person and online process will start with group sessions, and over time those trials will increase in scale until the Listening Exercise is running at full capacity next year.

But, my Lady, to do this, the Inquiry needs to draw on experts with a range of knowledge. We cannot ourselves design and set up a system that can reach out to potentially tens of thousands of persons wishing to share their experiences and then manage that information also. So the company Ipsos has been appointed by the Inquiry to bring research and analysis expertise to the Inquiry's design and piloting of this process.

They will set up the pilot process by which meetings can take place for people to share their experiences, and approaches might include one member of the public meeting someone who is an expert in talking about such things. It may involve group meetings, focus groups or sharing by phone and virtual meetings.

Of course, appropriate support will be arranged with the Inquiry to ensure those early trials don't have a detrimental impact on those participating, but the trials will take place in different locations across the United Kingdom and will target different types of people and groups.

The initial Listening will be undertaken by Ipsos on behalf of the Inquiry but in combination with other organisations that might be needed, such as community outreach groups and experts in trauma. Inquiry officials and you, my Lady, may be attending individual sessions, but it is too early to tell.

A consortium will then gather those experiences alongside members of the Inquiry team so that they can be properly analysed and summarised before being placed into a form that can be admitted into the record.

M&C Saatchi, a second company, has been appointed by the Inquiry to help the Inquiry inform people how and when to come forward to talk about what happened to them, and they are required to design the plans required to communicate with people to ensure that we can reach across society to hear from as many people as possible.

My Lady, some concern has been raised about a communications company doing the Listening. May I say for the sake of clarity, they will not themselves be doing the Listening.

The contracts will run for between five to eight months depending on how quickly the work progresses and how much insight the Inquiry can generate from bereaved groups and interested organisations, all of whom will of course be consulted.

Both companies have been required to declare any potential conflict of interest and their declarations have been considered and approved by the Inquiry. The Solicitor to the Inquiry, Mr Martin Smith, has provided further information about this process in a note that will be circulated this morning and may indeed already have been sent out.

My Lady, I emphasise that the experiences which will be shared will not be filed in the hearing by way of direct oral evidence or as individual testimony, because it must necessarily be anonymised. But legal representation to participate will not therefore be necessary and it's not intended that the Inquiry will fund legal assistance for people to participate.

I further emphasise that this is quite separate from the direct oral testimony that you will be receiving concerning the circumstances of individual deaths where such evidence is relevant to the light that it sheds upon whether there were systemic failures.

Some of the core participants have again asked in their written submissions some questions about the process: who will be doing the Listening, what qualifications if any will the listeners have, what training if any will the listeners have, how will the experiences be recorded? This and much, much more of course remains to be worked out, but naturally it will all be shared with the core participants as soon as the Inquiry is able to do so.

Turning then to commemoration.

Given the scale of loss and hardship, the Inquiry wishes to provide opportunities for that loss and hardship to be commemorated as part of the process. The Inquiry team intends to create a physical installation in its future hearing centre, which could be a static or mobile artwork or a more organic piece that grows over time, such as, for example, a book of commemoration, a picture or video wall. It's also looking at how the Inquiry website can be used for commemoration.

My Lady, I know that you have asked the Inquiry team to work over the coming weeks with the core participants and those who have suffered so much to offer our thinking on this matter and so that they may be able to contribute to the process.

You have said that we should agree some principles and find the right solution, one that is suitable and that captures the right feelings and emotions.

So, further to your direction, the Inquiry team will be in call shortly with affected groups and will involve them as appropriate in coming weeks in relation to development of that commemoration.

Now, my Lady, finally before you hear from the legal representatives, may I say that there will be a further preliminary hearing for this module. It will be held early in 2023 in London, on a specific date and at a venue to be confirmed, but probably here.

The public hearing in Module 2 will take place in London in the summer of 2023, next year, and it will last around eight weeks.

We are proceeding, as I have said and as some core participants have acknowledged, at immense pace, and that is a sensible and achievable time at which to conduct the Module 2 public hearing.

Notice will be given of everything that is required to be so notified. My Lady, it may not always allow for as much time as the core participants would like. We will do our best, but time is against us, and there is a huge amount to be done.

My Lady, I've sought to lay out where the Inquiry stands at present in the major procedural terms, but we're also here of course to listen to the core participants about the Inquiry and how it should proceed, and we will of course, as I've said, take careful account of everything that will be said to you this morning.

You have received, as you know, a note from Counsel to the Inquiry setting out the issues that may be explored, and you have also received ten written submissions in response, one of which is a joint note on behalf of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Group and the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice.

The majority of the remainder of the core participants have kindly indicated that they don't wish and haven't wished to file written submissions, but the written submissions which have been filed have of course all been circulated around the core participants.

My Lady, we understand that of the core participants there will be ten who will wish now to make oral submissions to you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Keith, thank you. I have been asked to take a break for the stenographer, who has been doing an excellent job on the transcript. So we shall break now and return at 11.30, please.
