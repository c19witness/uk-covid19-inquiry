12. Response Statement by Lead Counsel to the Inquiry
=====================================================

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, there is much to reflect upon. We, but much more importantly you, will reflect on the points that have been made in the course of the proceedings today, but may I nevertheless seek to answer just some of the points which can be answered, we believe, straightaway.

Whilst Ms Gallagher's exhortations continue to ring in our ears, can I start with some of the points that she made, perhaps what may be described as the systemic points going to the broad nature and width of this Inquiry.

In relation to her submissions concerning Module 2C, and of course the crucial issue concerning the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive from early 2017 to 11 January 2020, notwithstanding the point made that there is a distinct absence of any reference to that important matter in the provisional outline of scoping documents, it is in fact a matter which is expressly identified in paragraph 3 of the provisional outline of scope for Module 2C. And that's something upon which you will be hearing further submissions, no doubt, from Ms Dobbin on Wednesday.

In relation to the notion of an English-specific module, the very short answer is that the provisional outline of scope for Module 2 identifies that the central government structures and bodies concerned with the UK response to the pandemic will form a key part of Module 2. The reference to the United Kingdom in that context necessarily includes England because, as we all know, England forms no separate entity in a federal model in the United Kingdom and, insofar as it is within the United Kingdom, it naturally forms part of any consideration of United Kingdom issues.

The reason, of course, why there is nevertheless a separate Module 2A, 2B and 2C is because, alongside the UK decision-making, there was also relevant decision-making in relation to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The last point that I would like to address in relation to Ms Gallagher's submissions concerned the pleasure of having the advocates come to a further module hearing in 2024. The Inquiry team couldn't possibly begin to make submissions in relation to the desirability or benefit of that course being adopted at this very early stage indeed.

Returning then to the beginning of the submissions this morning and the points made by the advocates for the core participants earlier in this process.

In relation to Mr Weatherby's submissions concerning the disclosure process and the Rule 9 process, it was suggested that the Cabinet Office would not be required to provide all relevant documents. That is how Mr Weatherby put the iniquity, as he saw it, of the process we have adopted. So I must correct I'm sure what is an inadvertent but nevertheless misapprehension.

What we have sought to do is, rather than tie the disclosure obligation to the very broad, high level, necessarily opaque outline of scope, which is a document which was prepared to enable the core participants prospectively to decide whether or not they wished to apply to become core participants, we are seeking to tie the disclosure obligation to a more targeted, more focused understanding of what it is you are seeking to investigate in the course of Module 2.

So we are expressly asking that the government document providers provide material relevant to the key decisions, the people, the events, the matters that are really important.

So targeting the disclosure process in that way and the Rule 9 process in that way is not a derogation from the Inquiry's obligation to obtain potentially relevant documents for subsequent disclosure; it is designed to make the process work more smoothly, more sensibly, and to ensure that the right documents are obtained.

As I said earlier, too much disclosure is as unhelpful as too little disclosure, and you may conclude, my Lady, that ultimately this debate comes down not to an analysis of whether or not there is some forensic unfairness in the process that you have adopted, but is actually one of engagement.

Because you may well conclude that the core participants feel that unless there is some means by which we can tell them what it is that we're asking for over and above the disclosure of the provisional outline of scope, that they may feel that they have been denied a sufficient and proper opportunity to engage in that process.

But I can assure them -- and as you in fact stated in your ruling in Module 1 -- they will be provided with a monthly update of where we've got to in terms of the Rule 9 process and disclosure, and that will obviously reflect quite a lot more about the way in which we have been asking for documents and what we have been given. And, of course, as the documents are provided, they will necessarily be able to see what issues those documents go to, so they will immediately be able to assess which of the issues in the provisional outline of scope document those documents concern.

We would also wish to make the point that you may consider in due course that the time will come when there will have to be disclosure of a more granular or detailed list of issues because, as we get nearer to the point in the process where we start to make decisions about the likely witnesses, and what precisely the public hearing will look at, the CPs will need to have at that stage a better understanding of frankly what questions will be the areas which will be posed of the witnesses. So they will be bound to get at that stage a more detailed understanding, as I say, of the list of issues.

**Lady Hallett**: So the question the core participants, I think, are raising is this, isn't it: will there be sufficient detail in the monthly updates pending what you say will be a more detailed list of issues to come later?

**Mr Keith**: We believe so, my Lady. But, in any event, as a matter of principle -- and I'll come back to this in a moment in the course of addressing one of the other submissions -- the iniquity of providing the Rule 9 requests is this: it was suggested that of course the core participants would be grateful by sight of the Rule 9 requests, but there was no mention of what will surely follow, which is that each of the core participants would then seek to invite the Inquiry to recalibrate, reformulate, reiterate perhaps, the Rule 9s which have already been sent out. And when one considers of course the number of recipients who have received a Rule 9 request, that will require a hugely significant administrative process, because the Inquiry team will receive a myriad number of requests in writing for the Rule 9 process to be recalibrated; and, when we are dealing with the receipt of tens of thousands of documents along with all the other matters which will need to be addressed, that is an impossible burden.

**Lady Hallett**: So you say the burden is coming not in posting or emailing the Rule 9 requests themselves, it's in responding to what the core participants say?

**Mr Keith**: Because they will surely --

**Lady Hallett**: Analysing and responding to.

**Mr Keith**: Absolutely, and it's perfectly understandable. There will be no benefit to be gained in seeing what the Rule 9 requests consisted of unless they return to the fray by engaging in the minutiae of those requests and then seeking to persuade us to make further or different requests.

The further submission was made on behalf of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Group by Mr Weatherby to the effect that the group would be significantly denied a proper involvement in the Inquiry's process unless it was provided with further detail of the Rule 9s or of undisclosed documents.

But, as I've sought to suggest, firstly they will receive those monthly updates; secondly, in due course there will be a far better understanding of the issues, necessarily; and, thirdly, when one stands back from this process, at the heart of it will be the disclosure of the actual material itself, the stuff of the forensic heart of this Inquiry. And it is when they receive all those documents, which will necessarily go far wider than any attempt to describe in writing what the broad issues consist of, they will see immediately what evidential points can be made, what the forensic links are, and where the Inquiry is headed.

So it is, in my respectful submission, simply not correct to suggest that the core participants are being denied in any material way a proper involvement in the process or a proper opportunity to become engaged in the disclosure process. It is a hare that cannot be allowed to run.

In relation to the submissions made by Mr Williams King's Counsel, he suggested that there may be concerns in relation to the differences in the wording between the scope documents for Module 2 and Modules 2A, 2B and 2C.

In my respectful submission, nothing turns on a difference or any differences in language between those outline of scope documents. The modules are different, my Lady. They are different because they deal with and they address different decision-making processes. They are nevertheless fundamentally aligned, although I acknowledge that there may be differences in detail or in emphasis. But my learned friend should refrain, we would respectfully suggest, from believing that there is anything more significant in the differences in wording than that.

The evidence, which is what will really matter, will of course overlap between the sub-modules in Module 2, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the evidence will be identical, and nor could it.

In relation to the submissions made by Ms Mitchell King's Counsel, obviously it would be foolhardy of the Inquiry team to rule out any possibility of delay, but of course delay is not inevitable, even if it is not to be welcomed at all.

We make this point in relation to whether or not the Rule 9 process and the disclosure process, significant procedures as they are, may lead to delay. The more focused we can make the Rule 9 process, the more streamlined we can make the disclosure process, the more we can reduce the risk of delay.

She posed a question as to whether or not the timetable for Module 2 encompassed Modules 2A, 2B and 2C. Without letting too many cats out of the bag, because obviously Modules 2A, 2B and 2C will be addressed by you tomorrow and on Wednesday, they are entirely separate chronologically.

She also asked whether or not evidence would be led in writing. Yes, a great deal of evidence will have to be led in writing, but it won't all necessarily be read out.

Turning then to some of the submissions made on behalf of Save the Children UK, Just for Kids Law and the Children's Rights Alliance for England by Ms Twite.

She raised the important issue which I'm going to call, with a terrible modern euphemism, the cross-cutting issue of how matters in relation to, for example, education and the impact of the pandemic on children and young persons would be divided between the early module, Module 2, and the later module which, as I've said, will deal with education, children and young persons.

The answer is this: Module 2, as I've said already, will be looking at the extent to which decision-makers had regard to the particular interests of children and young persons, and in a very broad sense the likely consequences on the educational structure in the United Kingdom.

That's because the focus of Module 2 is on the etymology of the decision-making itself. But the issues, for example, the detailed consideration of the impact on schools and on children and young persons, are not falling, and they're not intended to fall, within Module 2. We simply cannot look at the specific impact in relation to every sectoral group in the context of examining whether the government failed adequately itself to look at those issues.

If the government failed to look at a particular impact or a particular area or the likely consequences on a particular societal group, then that omission and failure will be absolutely apparent.

In relation to some of the points made by Ms Sivakumaran on behalf of the disabled people's representative organisations and the long Covid sufferers, Long Covid Kids, Long Covid SOS and Long Covid Support, she invited you to consider making express reference to inequalities as part of each paragraph of the outline of scope document.

My Lady, we would invite you to decline to accept that invitation, however well advanced, and that's because you have made it absolutely plain in your opening statement, as it is reflected in the terms of reference, and I've repeated this morning, that the issue of the extent to which disabilities and inequalities were considered by the government is at the heart of Module 2, and you have tied that issue directly to the issue of the government's decision-making.

Properly analysed, each paragraph in the outline of scope document is just one facet of government decision-making. Each paragraph is a reflection of the various government functions that were in play. So it necessarily follows that inequalities will be considered, along with disabilities and all the other ways in which the government decision-making had the impacts that we believe it had, as part of Module 2. All the themes will be examined in part through that prism.

Turning next to the submissions by Ms Davies King's Counsel on behalf of Solace Women's Aid and Southall Black Sisters.

One of her central submissions focused on the iniquity of omission, if you like, on how the Inquiry would be able to identify whether or not there had been a failure by government to consider the important issues that it was obliged to consider, and on whether or not the Rule 9 and disclosure process would enable that feature of government decision-making not to be discovered.

My Lady, as I've said already, one of the central parts of Module 2, and one of the central issues, is your determination to assess how the government weighed disabilities and equalities in the balance in its decision-making.

As I've said, when the material comes back from the various government departments, it will be apparent immediately whether or not there was any or any sufficient consideration of those issues on the contemporaneous documentation, on the face of the contemporaneous documentation.

So if any particular government decision-maker failed to have adequate regard to the particular issue, then, as I've said, that omission will be apparent, and it will have a forensic significance all of its own.

She advanced also further submissions in relation to the Rule 9 disclosure process, and she suggested that it would be a fairly straightforward process simply for the Rule 9 requests to be disclosed to the core participants.

As I ventured to suggest, no core participant would ever be satisfied with mere sight of the requests; they would inevitably wish to prefer them to be redrawn or recalibrated and, given the number of core participants and requests, that would impose an impossible burden on the Inquiry.

Mr Dayle, on behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations, advanced a particular submission concerning the degree to which you would examine the extent of institutional racism, and also the general subject and the important issue of the way in which government goes about recording the number of fatalities in the black and Asian minority ethnic communities, and also through the prism of the BAME workforce.

My Lady, those are extremely wide and complex issues, and I think all I can say at this stage is they cannot possibly be answered solely through the prism of Module 2. Module 2 cannot bear the weight of that sort of scrutiny because it is not a module designed to look at, in a broad sense, whether or not all the various aspects of the government are indeed institutionally racist.

What Module 2 will do instead is it makes it a forensic and evidential issue, and of course in the prism of Module 2 you will be asking suitable witnesses -- and no doubt based upon the material which is disclosed -- whether or not, in relation to specific decisions, those decisions were infected by that sort of iniquitous behaviour.

So the answer to my learned friend's submissions is not: yes, Module 2 or any module can look thematically at that concept, but yes, of course the right people will be the asked the right question as an evidential issue in relation to that theme.

He advanced further submissions dealing with specifically the way in which the Inquiry intended to look at impact on various sectors of workers and healthcare, the care sector, the educational sector, and the public sector generally.

You have determined that later modules will look at the impact on various sectoral groups, and this is where the examination of the impact will be predominant, but it's not an issue -- for the reasons I've attempted to espouse -- in relation to Module 2.

So, my Lady, that is all that we would say by way of response to the many thoughtful and enlightening submissions that you have heard.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Keith.

Thank everybody for attending, all of you who have made submissions. When I designated what seemed to me to be rather a large number of core participants, I did so on the basis, I hoped, they would all provide great assistance to the Inquiry, and that's how it is proving to be. So thank you all very much for your submissions.

I have already indicated that I have an open mind and the Inquiry remains flexible, and that I do undertake to ensure that all your submissions are taken into very careful consideration before I reach any decisions. So, thank you, everybody.

For those who are interested in the Modules 2A and 2B: as you have already heard, 2A and 2B, Scotland and Wales, tomorrow, and then 2C, Northern Ireland, on Wednesday.

Thank you very much indeed.

*(3.48 pm)*

*(The hearing adjourned until 10 am on Tuesday, 1 November 2022)*
