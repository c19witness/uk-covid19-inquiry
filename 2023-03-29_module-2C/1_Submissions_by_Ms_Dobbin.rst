Transcript for Module 2C Preliminary Hearing dated 29 March 2023

*(1.45 pm)*

**Baroness Hallett**: Good afternoon everyone, all of whom are attending remotely, I am here in a central London venue with counsel to this module, Ms Clair Dobbin KC in another room and with the solicitor to the Inquiry, Mr Martin Smith present in this room with me.

The aim of the preliminary hearings is for me to check in public on the progress that a module is making and to ensure that good progress is being made and this Module 2C is focused on decision making in Northern Ireland in response to the pandemic.

So, I will be analysing the kind of progress that's been made and listen to any concerns that the Core Participants may have and wish to air in public about such progress.

Core Participants play a vital role in the Public Inquiry and, as I said this morning, in the hearing into Module 2B, focusing on decision making in Wales, I have been very impressed to date by the quality of the submissions made to me by many of the Core Participants and the commitment that they have shown and I hope they will continue to show.

With the help of Core Participants, I hope we can conduct a thorough investigation of the issues that affect the people most in Northern Ireland and meet an ambitious timetable that I have set.

It is in that way that I can reach conclusions about the preparedness for a pandemic and the response to it and make any recommendations as we go along. I am determined that the public of the United Kingdom and, for the purposes of today's hearing in particular, the public of Northern Ireland should not have to wait until the end of the Inquiry and the hearing of all the modules for the answers to their legitimate questions and concerns and I wish to publish recommendations that may reduce suffering in any future pandemic as soon as practically possible.

I would also wish to emphasise that I am determined that modules such as this, focusing on the Devolved Administrations will not be in any way a side show. They are a vital part of the hearings, as far as I am concerned, and I will ensure that throughout the Inquiry, in these modules and indeed in other modules where we will be looking at matters that affect the Devolved Administrations and the devolved nations, that we properly investigate all relevant matters.

I have, as far as this afternoon's hearing is concerned, received written submissions from some of the Core Participants to the module. I am very grateful to them. I have read them very carefully. I will bear them all very much in mind and it also means that because they have been helpful enough to provide them in advance, they can keep their oral submissions to those matters upon which they wish to focus and therefore highlight.

So, having said that, could I now call please on Ms Dobbin, lead counsel to the Inquiry for this module to explain in detail the issues for me to consider this afternoon.

Ms Dobbin?

1. Submissions by Ms Dobbin
===========================

**Ms Dobbin**: Well, my Lady on behalf of the counsel team I want once again to welcome those colleagues from Northern Ireland, and those from England and Wales too, who appear on behalf of the Core Participants in Module 2C and who join us for this online hearing.

Of course, that welcome very much extends to the Core Participants too. We are really grateful for their interest and their participation. I thought I would start, if I may, by introducing those who are represented and may I begin, please, with the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, who are represented by Ms Campbell KC; Disability Action Northern Ireland represented by Mr Friedman KC; the Trades Union Congress and the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, represented by Mr Jacobs, and you will hear submissions from all three.

Also appearing before you are the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland, represented by Ms Anyadike-Danes KC; the National Police Chiefs' Council, represented by Mr Phillips KC; Dame Arlene Foster and Mr Givan represented by Ms Ellison; Michelle O'Neill represented by Mr Bassett; the Northern Ireland Department of Finance represented by Mr Hanna KC; and the Executive Office of Northern Ireland represented by Mr Sharp.

The Northern Ireland Department of Health also appear before you as well.

There are many advantages to a remote hearing but I'm sorry not to see my learned friends in person. It is worth repeating that the Module 2C hearings will, of course, take place in Northern Ireland and we will have plenty of time together then but I wanted to press the point with my learned friends that, regardless of where they are situated, the counsel team for Module 2C are always available to speak and to be of assistance to them.

My Lady, with your leave, on behalf of the Module 2 team, I wanted to provide a brief update to Core Participants on our work and to address shortly some discrete issues that I thought I might be able to assist on before you hear from Core Participants.

I'm conscious that a number of these points have already been made in the other modules and so I will try to be as brief as I possibly can be.

So, first of all, equality issues. We last came together at the Module 2C hearing on 2 November 2022 and on that occasion it was clear that there was a good deal of common ground between the concerns of the Core Participants and issues which were of import to them and to those of the Inquiry.

That hearing was important because it always makes a difference to hear issues being articulated. Many of the submissions that were made, the points that were emphasised, have either been directly incorporated into our work, for example in the form of questions that have been asked of witnesses, or have been bookmarked as relevant to a later part of the Inquiry's work.

It is really important that I repeat at the outset that through you, my Lady, and under your direction, the counsel team for Module 2C regards it as fundamental to its task that it understands how the pandemic impacted on those in Northern Ireland who stood to be disproportionately affected or, in ordinary language, who stood to lose more, whether that be by the virus itself or the measures that were taken to counteract it.

That is the lens through which we have approached our work to date and will continue to do so.

Plainly, much of the work in Module 2C is focused on understanding fundamental issues, much of a constitutional nature. To what extent was the core decision making set by decisions that had already been made by Central Government? To what extent did the Northern Irish Executive have the latitude to do things differently or were politicians constrained by the limits of their law making powers or pragmatic issues like access to scientific advice or Central Government funding?

Overarchingly did the power sharing model of government work for the people of Northern Ireland in this time of crisis? Did a power sharing model have benefits, as compared to the usual model of governance, whereby scrutiny is provided by a political opposition or were there shortcomings? What challenges did power sharing pose for the politicians themselves?

Now, these are all core issues. But as you have made clear, my Lady, of equal importance is the question of how the interests of those who stood to suffer disadvantage by the pandemic were taken into account in making those key decisions in Northern Ireland. It goes without saying that those who might or did in fact experience particular disadvantage throughout the pandemic may differ across different parts of the UK. I wanted to make absolutely clear that we are sensitive to that in relation to Northern Ireland. Those issues have to be looked at through the lens of inequality or disadvantage in Northern Ireland and, on that, we are ad idem with the written submissions of the TUC and the Northern Ireland Committee.

So the issue of inequality is firmly embedded in the work of Module 2C. Given that, I'm not sure that it is necessary for us to frame the approach that we are taking in Module 2C in any more formal terms.

The principal work of a public inquiry is to gather evidence, to be objective and fair, to hold the line when it comes to competing interests and rights in the Inquiry and ultimately to enable its Chair to come to conclusions or to make recommendations which are founded upon evidence which, judged overall, is sufficiently detailed and reliable.

But as part and parcel of that, it can examine the extent to which consideration was given to equality duties or to broader questions about the welfare of different groups in society and an Inquiry can achieve all of those things and keep at its core the human experience of those most affected by events.

Ultimately, of course the key decisions made were made by people doubtless operating under great pressure and, in Northern Ireland alone power sharing having just been resumed after three years, and that's an important issue in Module 2C as well. But we are entitled to examine, on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland, the decision making and importantly the machinery which is intended to support it but fairly, and in particular in Northern Ireland, having a mind to the political sensitivities at stake but not being daunted by those political sensitivities either.

We said it at the first hearing but this is a public inquiry for all and it is vitally important that every part of the community feels as though they have a stake in it and, when it comes to it, witnesses must endeavour to go beyond the politics of the personal and to ensure that the focus of this Inquiry is on our shared humanity.

In analysing the proceedings of the Northern Ireland Assembly committees, it is conspicuous that important figures noted at the time that there would, in due course, be a public inquiry that would afford the opportunity to analyse the decisions made or the basis upon which they were made. Some figures pointed at the time to the limited capacity during the pandemic to analyse decisions made or to consolidate their understanding.

In addition to that, the bereaved families make a singularly important point: because there are no power sharing arrangements at the moment, they are deprived of the scrutiny that there would otherwise be in Northern Ireland through the normal operation, for example, of Assembly committees after the event.

In short, my Lady, the moment for self-examination and objective scrutiny has come and I repeat on your behalf how important it is that those who are asked to provide evidence do so without gloss, without defensiveness and having firmly in mind the importance of using the experience gained to inform what could be done better in the future and we are grateful to those witnesses who have been explicit about this.

As we refer to at the last hearing, our early work has thus been to understand the mechanisms by which there was assessment of the impact that decisions would make -- or would have, sorry, on particular groups in Northern Ireland. The Equality Act 2010 does not extend to Northern Ireland. Protection against discrimination is found in different bits of legislation.

The analogue to the public sector equality duty is found in section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 but, despite the different architecture, the concepts which apply, principally of the need to have due regard to promote equality in respect of persons with certain characteristics, are familiar across the nations.

In the context of a public inquiry, of course the issue might run wider than that. In addition to legal duties, what account was taken or how broader consideration was given to welfare or the wellbeing of certain groups or consideration about existing inequalities and how they formed part of the key decision making process may also fall to be examined.

Again, to that end, an early part of our work was to seek evidence from the statutory commissioners and we are grateful for the engagement of the Commissioner for Older People, who is one of our Core Participants in this regard, about their role during the pandemic in relation to the Government decision making process.

We also sought evidence from the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Younger People, the Equality Commission, Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission too.

The Equality Commission, with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, has, as is pointed out by Disability Action Northern Ireland, been designated under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Disabled Persons as the independent mechanism tasked with promoting, protecting and monitoring the implementation of that Convention in Northern Ireland.

I wondered, if I may, to say a word about Disability Action Northern Ireland. Since the last hearing, they have become a Core Participant. That is a welcome development to us. The point that almost 1 in 5 people in Northern Ireland have a disability alone speaks to how important their participation in Module 2C is and we look forward to working with them.

On behalf of the Inquiry, I wish to make clear that we are sensitive to disabled people not being a homogeneous group. I also understand that many disabled adults or older people don't want to be described in terms of being vulnerable. We do use that term in Module 2C but I hope that it is clear that it is intended in the well understood sense of that word, in this context to denote the clinically vulnerable or those like children who need special care. But the main point is surely this, the representation of disabled people and their families as a means of ensuring that the Inquiry can understand the full range of their experience during the pandemic and in their own words.

We are grateful to Disability Action Northern Ireland for setting out to the Inquiry the formal structures which exist so to ensure that account is given to the rights and needs of disabled people. As we understand the point they make, the importance of these mechanisms is that they exist so as to produce better outcomes for disabled people. They are not mechanistic.

It goes without saying that part of the work of Module 2C will be to investigate the extent to which the interests of disabled people were taken into account in the key decision making. The Disability Action Northern Ireland submissions reiterate that these are not novel concepts, they are part of domestic law and reflect a consensus in international law too.

We're aware that the Department of Communities has the lead responsibility for disability policy in Northern Ireland. We have been provided with a draft statement from that Department, which we are in the process of reviewing but, as an immediate step, we will consider any further questions that need to be asked of that Department in light of some of the issues that have been raised in the Disability Action submissions.

My Lady, after the hearing in Module 2 you issued an important ruling that, first of all, the Inquiry should obtain expert evidence from a suitably qualified expert or experts on the nature and degree of pre-pandemic structural racism. The purpose of such evidence is to assist you to understand the issue and to provide a clearer evidential foundation upon which the specific issues in Module 2 can be explored and developed.

You directed that such expert be commissioned and ruled that you would keep under review the extent to which such evidence would be needed in other modules.

Second, as to whether expert evidence should also be obtained regarding pre-existing structural discrimination on other grounds and also on intersectional grounds, you ruled that, at the first instance at least, the Inquiry team should, in addition to the expert evidence in relation to structural racism, explore the possibility of obtaining a single report covering these other issues, if necessary drafted by a small team of experts who cover different specialisms.

My Lady, it is our respectful submission that you adopt the same approach here and consider whether the issue of pre-existing structural racism or other forms of structural discrimination in relation to Northern Ireland can be encompassed in that same report. I will come back to other experts, if I may.

In their written submissions, the bereaved families have raised the question of whether the Inquiry will consider the impact of austerity measures in relation to the pandemic. By "austerity", we mean that to understand the cutbacks to funding of public services after 2010 and prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. My Lady, the issue of budgetary cutbacks and the impact upon readiness to respond to the pandemic is part of Module 1.

As you are aware, one of Module 2C's provisional terms of scope is the impact of the absence of ministers and the Executive in Northern Ireland from early 2017 until 11 January 2020. This is a distinct issue from that raised in Module 1, which is resilience and preparedness. Rather the focus in Module 2C is how the lack of a functioning Executive in the three years prior to January 2020 impacted upon the decision making of those who came into power and who were almost immediately plunged into coping with the pandemic and the decisions they made.

So the focus is not so much the three years preceding the pandemic but rather the reality which confronted ministers when they took office and the impact that had on their decision making.

By way of example, we understand there to have been seven major reviews of health and social care between 2001 and 2016 in Northern Ireland, the Bengoa report in 2016 was regarded as important in terms of it advocating a programme for a reform of healthcare. Disability Action Northern Ireland have also pointed to the New Decade, New Approach agreement of January 2020, which was of course immediately impacted also by the onset of the pandemic.

Now, it may well be that the fact that the Bengoa report recommendations were not implemented was a factor in the decision making in response to the pandemic and, again, I repeat it is not an issue about readiness, rather it is about the situation as it confronted ministers when they took up the reins of power in 2020.

So, my Lady, I think the short point is that it is not within the scope of Module 2C to examine the effect of budgetary cuts or to focus on events before ministers came into office but rather to pick up the baton in January 2020 and to consider how that lack of an Executive up until then impacted on the Government response to the pandemic.

Turning then to the timetable. Before going on to set out shortly some of the work that has been done thus far, I was going to deal with the timetable as it stands. As our Core Participants know, the fact that Module 1 will start slightly later than originally planned has a knock-on effect, so that Module 2 will start on 29 April 2024 and I know that that sounds distant but, as we all know, that will come around soon enough.

It does mean that we have a little bit more time than the other nations in Module 2 to prepare for our hearings. But it also means that some of the Core Participants in Module 2 are under pressure to provide evidence that may form part of the hearings in both Modules 1 and 2 and Module 2C. We know, for example, that the Northern Ireland Department of Health is dealing with a large number of Rule 9 requests and that so too has evidence been sought from the former Health Minister, Mr Robin Swann, the former First Minister and the former Deputy First Minister too. So they have already been asked to provide evidence to other parts of the Inquiry.

Now, the bereaved families have asked whether they intend to ask Mr Swann for a statement and may I assure them that we do and plainly he will be an important witness. However, it is important that we try, in as much as we can at the moment, not to overload organisations or individuals in circumstances where we can afford, at the present, to stagger our approach.

The other point that we sought to make in our note that we filed prior to the hearing is that our timing affords a little bit more latitude to take into account evidence or information that's been received before we ask organisations to finalise the drafts of their initial witness statements or before we send Rule 9s to certain witnesses.

We think, for our part at least, that it is an advantage to Northern Ireland that the Module 2 hearing precedes us and that some of the foundations will have been laid before we take up the reins in Northern Ireland.

The approach remains the one we described at the outset. It is an iterative one. Our initial Rule 9 requests are broad but we will undoubtedly be issuing further Rule 9 requests as our understanding develops. These may well be aimed at individuals where more detailed evidence is needed on particular issues or where the evidence calls for a more specific response.

So just turning very briefly to timetable. We are working to that hearing, which will commence in April 2024. There will be a further preliminary hearing. The issue has been raised as to whether three weeks is enough for a hearing. The Inquiry is of the view that, having thought about the ground to be covered and considering that Module 1 and 2 will have preceded us and will lay some of that groundwork, that it is enough time but, in circumstances where we don't yet have a witness list and haven't sketched out our timetable, it will be premature to say that three weeks is not enough.

So turning then to Rule 9 requests and evidence. The Module 2C legal team has now issued 83 formal requests for evidence pursuant to Rule 9 of the rules. Some of these are joint with other Inquiry modules, particularly Module 2 and, as we anticipated, the first round of them was sent to the Executive Office, the Northern Ireland Government Departments, the Northern Ireland Office, Executive Agencies and the Chief Medical Officer.

We have disclosed the first tranche of documents to Core Participants comprising material received from the Executive Office and this includes things like briefing papers, situational reports and the minutes from executive meetings and we expect to provide further materials to Core Participants from other providers in the coming weeks.

The Inquiry has received approximately 3,000 documents in Module 2C alone from material providers and it is anticipated that a significant volume of these will be disclosed to the Core Participants.

As we have explained, Module 2C is in the process of developing its detailed Rule 9 requests to the First Ministers and to the Deputy First Minister, who will then move on to the Minister for Health, to other ministers and then to other key figures, and I repeat the point that we have made in our note, that we really welcome and encourage the identification of other potential witnesses and that we will consider any other suggestions put forward.

My Lady, I say all of this because we have noted the concern expressed on behalf of the bereaved families that a number of the Rule 9 requests to date seek to elicit what are described as corporate-type witness statements. In plain language, these are the sort of request for statements often sent to government bodies that require them to explain how the machinery works, how it did work during the pandemic, to identify who key personnel are, how they discharged their functions during the pandemic and those sorts of things, in terms of core political decision making.

I think it is right to say and to make clear that this is important evidence. It isn't mere window dressing because, as I've said, it is not just understanding how organisations work and who the key individuals are, it goes to the point that, under our system of government, those making the critical decisions are elected politicians. They are not specialists in a given field recruited to meet the needs of government at a given time, as for example is sometimes in the case of the United States of America. So it is very important to understand and scrutinise how the machinery of government supports the key decision making.

That said, we understand entirely the point made, that there is a risk that corporate evidence in particular is susceptible to glossing over problematic issues or presenting the picture that everyone within an organisation is of one mind or of one view. But I wanted to say this:

First of all, we are alive to that. Responses to Rule 9 are not an invitation for the provision of blandishment. Rule 9 requests are not a carte blanche for organisations to simply say what went well. Organisations are being asked questions intended to elicit whether, for example, there were competing views on central issues and how the decision making process that supported government accommodated a range of opinion.

Second, regardless of what we ask and how statements are provided, we seek the underlying material so as to be able to scrutinise what the reality was at the time.

Third, those who provide foundational witness statements may well be asked to provide oral evidence. So a witness who has sought through a witness statement to provide evidence which does not reflect reality or which glosses over the difficulties or offers little more than "Our organisation worked well" type sentiments will be examined about that and could be asked questions, if it is the case, why their statement did not reflect reality or did not make clear that there were difficulties.

Fourth, there is already material which has been generated by organisations which have embarked on lessons learned exercises or by other forms of commission against which decision making can be tested.

Fifth, the Inquiry will also be calling expert evidence as well and, again, that may constitute another route by which the decision making processes can be tested as well.

Of course, Module 2C is also open to hearing from any individuals within organisations or Departments who consider that they have important evidence to give or who are concerned that the full picture is not being presented.

The bereaved families have set out in their written submissions and asked whether we intend to approach other named individuals and organisations, which they have specified, and I won't here, my Lady, go into the detail of who they are but I can say that all of the individuals to whom they have referred are individuals whom we have planned to send Rule 9s.

The position of the RQIA is slightly different. It is responsible for inspecting health and social care services in Northern Ireland and it is likely that that body will have relevant evidence to give across a number of different parts of the Inquiry. But we will certainly consider the issues it might be able to assist with in relation to the key political decision making.

Separate to that, Ms Martina Ferguson, who jointly leads the bereaved families, has also provided a suggested list of witnesses as well and that too has been considered and taken into account by us.

The TUC in the Northern Ireland Committee have also submitted that a Rule 9 request should be sent to the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland, as the lead body responsible for the promotion of health and safety at work in Northern Ireland.

Following on from the last hearing and pursuant to the submissions which they made and bearing in mind the importance of the agro-food business in Northern Ireland, Module 2C did send a Rule 9 request to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs but these were questions relating to the vulnerability of persons who comprise that workforce. Granular issues about the enforcement of the Covid legislation and guidance in the workplace are not within the scope of Module 2C.

A further discrete issue, my Lady, which has been raised by the bereaved families is that of the restrictions around funerals and other gatherings in the event of a death. I wanted to say again, on behalf of the Module 2C legal team, that we understand that, for people who lost family members and friends, not having the support of others, not having familiar rituals and traditions which give solace and not being able to pay tribute to a loved one before people who knew them, all of those things must have been extremely painful to bear and made people feel very alone and absent kinship.

We are also conscious in Module 2C that particular significance is attached to the role of religious ceremonies and death and that these endure in Northern Ireland and there are cultural considerations which are specific to Northern Ireland in terms of how a death is marked too.

Consequently it is our intention to consider the restrictions related to funerals in Northern Ireland as part of the examination of non-pharmaceutical interventions, so, in other words, that Module 2C will examine whether and to what extent account was taken of how these restrictions would impact deleteriously upon bereaved people and the Inquiry will return later to examining in more detail the nature of that impact.

My Lady, the next issue, the Republic of Ireland.

One of the terms of scope in Module 2C is the extent to which political decisions were informed by the response of the Government of the Republic of Ireland to the pandemic.

Also, in your directions of January 2023, again having heard from Core Participants, you directed the Inquiry team to explore the relationships between the Devolved Governments and the UK Government and between the Government in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and the island of Ireland, as a single epidemiological unit.

Plainly, the decisions made by the Republic of Ireland are not within the scope of this Inquiry. Rather the issue is how the response of the Government in Northern Ireland to the pandemic was informed by the position taken by the Republic of Ireland when it came to key decision making.

Moreover, pursuant to your direction, our Rule 9 requests have asked recipients about co-operation with the Republic of Ireland more broadly. We have sought to understand the extent of co-operation, whether existing mechanisms for co-operation were used, if they weren't, why not, whether there were barriers, and we will continue to pursue that as a line of investigation, of course subject to your direction.

The bereaved families have asked specifically whether we intend to send Rule 9 requests to individuals or organisations in the Republic of Ireland, in order to have evidence about what the response of the Republic of Ireland to the pandemic was. The short answer to this is no, but I wanted to set out the reasons why we say that.

First, much of the information about the response of the Republic of Ireland to the pandemic is already in the public arena. By way of example only, the memorandum of understanding, which was made by the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Irish Departments of Health and their respective agencies -- and this was entitled Covid-19 Response -- Public Health Cooperation on an All-Ireland Basis, that is a public document and it provided that:

"The Covid-19 pandemic does not respect borders, therefore there is a compelling case for strong co-operation, including information sharing and, where appropriate, a common approach to action in both jurisdictions."

In other words, it set out an aspiration and it is this sort of publicly available material which provides us with a yardstick against which the substantive co-operation which actually occurred can be considered.

Second, the disclosure that we have from the Northern Ireland Departments and the Northern Ireland Office too, documents the respective positions taken on issues as between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom. In other words, we have a good understanding of those relationships from the material provided from the Northern Ireland perspective.

Third, aside from witnesses like the Minister for Health, Mr Swann, who will obviously be asked questions about co-operation and the mechanisms for co-operation, other types of witnesses -- and I have in mind witnesses like the Chief Medical Officer, will also be asked about co-operation, not from a political perspective but rather from a clinical perspective too and, again, will be asked questions about the use of mechanisms, whether the use of those mechanisms were sufficient, any barriers which existed, and so forth.

In other words, there are different ways of testing and examining this sort of evidence and these issues through the different witnesses who we intend to call.

Still on this subject of Rule 9s, the bereaved families have also repeated their request that they be provided with the Rule 9 requests sent to witnesses. As you are aware, my Lady, each month the Inquiry does send out an update to Core Participants about the Rule 9 requests which have been made and provides quite a lot of detail about what has been asked.

Certainly in Module 2C, as Core Participants are provided with statements and further evidence that will take place in due course, there may well be issues that they consider ought to be included in further Rule 9 requests or further evidence that they consider we ought to ask for. Again, I emphasise that, of course, it is open to them to contact us about them and that we would welcome that sort of engagement as well.

Next issue is that of a list of issues. Like our counterparts in Module 2A and B, we intend to provide a provisional detailed list of issues to Core Participants, which will provide greater clarity as to the matters which will be examined in Module 2C and, my Lady, we invite you to make a direction as to the date by which that ought to be served and respectfully suggest that this could be by 31 May 2023, so following on from each of the dates that have been set in the other modules.

Turning then to Relativity. My Lady, as you know, that is the platform which the Inquiry uses to disclose evidence to Core Participants. Documents are disclosed once they are assessed as relevant to Module 2C. They are stored so that they are searchable by providers or key terms or by words. They can be converted into text documents and internally searched too.

I know that in Module 2C some Core Participants expressed a degree of concern or some frustration about the functionality of that system and I just wanted to pick it up here because the bereaved families have repeated those concerns in their written submissions.

But, again, and I know this was set out in Module 2 as well, Epiq is providing training sessions and there is a link to access videos of that training as well and I know that the Inquiry is also exploring options to provide Core Participants with additional functionality in terms of coding, and that there will be an update about this shortly.

A more substantive issue perhaps is that of expert evidence. Module 2 but in conjunction with Modules 2A, B and C has instructed a number of experts. Of these Professor Ailsa Henderson from the University of Edinburgh has been instructed to report on the political structures for devolution within the United Kingdom and the mechanisms for inter-governmental decision making between the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations during the Covid-19 pandemic, in other words to explain the different bases upon which each of the Devolved Governments' rules in relation to Central Government and the relevance of that to the Covid pandemic.

Her report does provide expert evidence from a political science perspective as to the basis upon which Northern Ireland is governed. Professor Thomas Hale, from the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, has also been instructed to report on international data related to the Covid-19 pandemic, including analysing the effectiveness of the decision making of the UK Government and each Devolved Administration in response to the pandemic, in comparison to other countries. We anticipate that there will be points of comparison relevant here, for example with the Republic of Ireland.

Alex Thomas, from the Institute for Government, has been instructed today report on decision making structures of the UK Government in an emergency. So in particular looking at the Cabinet Office and Cabinet Committees, and so forth.

Separate to that, Gavin Freeguard, who is the former Programme Director and Head of Data and Transparency at the Institute of Government, has been instructed to report on the access to and use of data by the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations during the pandemic.

My Lady, we have already flagged -- attractive though it is to have experts who are in a position to comment across the UK, and obviously the strength of that is that it provides obvious points of comparison, we nonetheless recognise that Module 2C may well require some expertise which is Northern Ireland specific.

For my part, we will be in a better position to judge that when we have received all of the draft reports and responses to further questions that we have asked, particularly of Professor Ailsa Henderson.

In terms of evidence about devolution, it also appears to us that we might need to stand back and consider what more we need or what expert evidence might look like, above and beyond the background to devolution.

For example, if the question is: could the Government in Northern Ireland have done more and more quickly, then obviously there may be questions of law about what powers the Government had and there may be questions and issues around the practical limitations to which I have already alluded. I think it is just a question of delineation. There is likely to be evidence of fact on those issues. It is really just in terms of flagging that my learned friends may wish to consider and have a think about what more expert evidence might lend to that sort of evidence.

As has already been indicated, after disclosure of those draft expert reports, those that have been commissioned, Core Participants will be invited to raise points of clarification or new matters that are agreed by the Inquiry to be relevant with each expert and I think that will also afford the Core Participants an opportunity to indicate issues which might require dedicated Northern Ireland expertise.

I am going to turn briefly then, if I may, to the hearings in Module 2C. They are some time off so I'm not going to spend much time today on this issue. I know that no one will thank me for that. It was really to flag a few main points.

My Lady, Rule 10 of the Inquiry makes provides of how witnesses will be questioned in an Inquiry and here that will be an issue of consequence, given the enormous amount of ground to be covered and that there must be a balance given the pressures on this Inquiry to produce reports and recommendations which are timely. So that means that the hearings will necessarily have to be conducted with focus and efficiency and, obviously, a very good deal of work will be done in advance.

We don't expect that witnesses will be called just to repeat what's already in their statements. They will be focusing on the issues of significance and where you, my Lady, may need to resolve points of dispute also.

Pursuant to Rule 10, only counsel to the Inquiry may ask questions of the witness and requires no permission for you to do so but, under Rule 10.4, the recognised legal representative of a Core Participant can apply for permission to ask questions as well.

But aside that, putting to one side those rules, Core Participants in Module 2C will have an important part to play in informing the questions asked of witnesses. In terms of how we intend to ensure that, each witness who is called to give evidence at the hearing will be provided with a hard copy bundle of documents for their use at the hearing. This will include things like their statement and any documents to which they may be referred. An evidence proposal will be prepared for every such witness and this will be circulated to Core Participants in advance and that will also include a list of topics that each witness will be examined about, references to the relevant parts of the witness statements and exhibits and a draft index of the documents that will form the witness bundle, including those documents about which the witness may be asked questions.

So Core Participants will be asked to review the evidence proposals and to provide comments and to make any submissions as to additional issues which they may want to have raised with a particular witness or any new document that they consider should be included. I can say that that will be considered carefully and that a final proposal will be circulated before the witness gives evidence.

In addition to that, my Lady, the Inquiry will also adopt the additional process whereby Core Participants can meet with or write to, whichever they prefer, the Module 2C team following the submission of their observations and that's so that they can explain the rationale underpinning their observations. So there will be a more informal process of dialogue about what oral evidence will cover and will allow Core Participants to ensure that we have understood the points that they seek to make.

In terms of the opening and closing statements, the Module 2C team will prepare a detailed opening and that may, for example, draw on the evidence from the Module 2 hearings so, effectively, to set the scene from opening Module 2C and to introduce the themes and the evidence which will be explored during the hearings and some of the key materials to which we will refer as well. It is not likely that there will be a closing statement.

The Core Participants who wish to make opening and closing statements will be welcome to do so. I don't think we need to get into the detail of this now but doubtless we will come back to issues about time limits and that kind of thing on a later date.

My Lady, I wanted to finish then, if I may, on the listening exercise, which has been named within the Inquiry as Every Story Matters. It is part of the work of this Inquiry that it will gather and assimilate the accounts of people across the United Kingdom about the impact of the pandemic on their lives. As has already been observed, such is the breadth of human experience of the pandemic, that this is really the only way in which the Inquiry can ensure that record is made of the accounts of those who wish to participate.

There will be a new online form with a save and come back feature. So that means people can record their account at their own pace but have the ability to come back to it if they want to. The Inquiry has also received input that there needs to be other ways for participants to provide their accounts. So that will include things like a phone line and a paper form too.

There will also be in person sessions with a specific focus on hearing from people who might not otherwise come forward or who would welcome being with other people who suffered bereavement or who had similar experiences to them.

The Inquiry wants to hold community listening events across the United Kingdom too, which will be attended by Inquiry staff and I know, my Lady, that, subject to your Inquiry commitments, that you would like to be able to attend some of those as well, and there will also be an ability to participate in different languages.

The Inquiry's approach to developing Every Story Matters is premised on an understanding of the trauma that people have been through. It is informed by this and, where possible, emotional support will be available.

The accounts given will be analysed and reports will be produced for each relevant module investigation and they will then be submitted as evidence disclosed to the Core Participants and also published as part of the evidence in those hearings. So, in this way the experience of those affected by the pandemic will be integrated into the Inquiry's core work.

The Inquiry is also about to launch a number of tenders to procure specialist services to support Every Story Matters too. These are separate contracts which will follow on from the existing interim ones which come to an end shortly and these new contracts will cover research to gather, analyse and report on people's experiences, communications to create content that raises awareness of Every Story Matters so that people can take part if they wish and community events, expert provision, to help the Inquiry gather experiences face to face, from people within the community.

I said this at the last hearing but, obviously, we very much hope that people from across Northern Ireland will participate and we encourage them to do so. It is really important that their voices are heard as part of this Inquiry.

My Lady, you have been clear from the very outset that you wanted to find a fitting means within this Inquiry of commemorating those who died. To that end, the Inquiry consulted as widely as possible as to what might be appropriate, again given the scale of the loss. To that end, my Lady, you decided that a tapestry should be created and it would be a physical installation, each panel created by a different artist working with a particular community or communities to develop it.

Tapestries have been used as a means throughout history of capturing the common experience of significant events or of remembering them. Perhaps uniquely, a tapestry is a form of art which is able to both involve and reflect different communities, which is traditional but nonetheless is also one which can be modern, and that seems so important given the diversity of experience and loss which it will capture and, of course, more than anything it is a piece of art which will also endure.

The intention is for the first panels to be shown at the UK Inquiry's hearing centre in time for the first substantive hearings in Module 1 in June.

The panels will be transportable to wherever the Inquiry holds hearings in the UK so people in Northern Ireland will be able to see them if they attend in person.

It is also planned that films which convey and explain about harm and suffering caused by the pandemic will also be shown at the commencement of each hearing too and this will include Module 2C substantive hearings also. I think further details about that are set out in the solicitor to the Inquiry's note from January.

My Lady, those are the opening submissions on behalf of the counsel team. I think that all I otherwise need to do is ask your permission that the Core Participant submissions be published on the Inquiry website.

On behalf of the Inquiry team I wanted to thank Core Participants for the care with which they have considered the issues and the constructive way in which they have sought to engage with us and with the Inquiry too. I can't say or express clearly enough how helpful that is. Is there anything that I can assist you with at this point?

**Baroness Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Dobbin. No, there's nothing else at this stage and I'm grateful to you.

May I just, before I call on Ms Campbell KC, apologise to those who may have had problems with the streaming on the Inquiry website. I gather there was a problem but I'm told that it has now been resolved but for those who are members of the public or others who are trying to follow via the website, don't worry I'm reassured or assured that the Core Participants' attendance or participation in this hearing hasn't been affected.

Perhaps you can confirm that, Ms Campbell? If you are there.

**Ms Campbell**: My Lady, I am and I can.

**Baroness Hallett**: Thank you.
