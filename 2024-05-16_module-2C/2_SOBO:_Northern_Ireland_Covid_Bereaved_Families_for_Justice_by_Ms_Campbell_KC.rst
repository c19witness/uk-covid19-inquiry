2. Submissions on Behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice by Ms Campbell KC
======================================================================================================

**Ms Campbell**: My Lady, history has taught us that whenever disparate groups of people are thrown together in grief, in shared loss, but motivated by an innate sense of injustice because their loved ones have died needlessly, or prematurely, and they know innately that something has gone very badly wrong, those people are generally proven to be all too right.

That may be true of the bereaved in this jurisdiction more than any other. It is certainly true of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice.

But it's also true that for so many families the path to understanding the truth of how their loved one died is often painful and bittersweet, and that has certainly been the case for the last three weeks. Although our members who attended these hearings or followed on line by other means were forewarned of much of the evidence that they would hear, hearing it so starkly outlined has nonetheless been very, very difficult. Every omission or oversight or failure represents a fork in the road, a missed opportunity that had it not been made might mean the person they loved and lost would still be here or might mean that families would have been comforting loved ones in their death, or they would have been given the sendoff that they so deserved, and it would certainly mean that the grieving process would have been a great deal easier.

And, my Lady, this past three weeks has been littered with oversights, omissions and failings.

The impact of the three-year absence of our Assembly, the years of underfunding of our health and Civil Service, single year budgets, leaving departments ravaged and worn, the silo approach of the Department of Health and other departments, the failures of the TEO to step up and step in, the unedifying dispute as to which department was to take the lead, the failure to stand up NICCMA to ensure a cross-governmental approach, the failures in test, trace and isolate, the prolonged absence of a Chief Scientific Adviser, the apparently boundless power of our Chief Medical Officer, who wore far too many hats, the failures in leadership from Westminster, the devaluing of an all-Ireland memorandum of understanding, the failure to properly consider in advance of or during the pandemic the need to protect our older people and those who were medically vulnerable, or indeed at any stage to consider the unequal impact of NPIs and other measures, the reckless policy of hospital discharge, the attendance of ministers at the funeral of Bobby Storey, the consequence of that attendance upon public messaging and public confidence, delays in decision-making in autumn 2020 unquestionably leading to that fatal spike in January 2021, the deliberate, egregious and abusive use of the cross-community vote, the leaks, the spins, the sectarianism, the political sniping, the wiping of phones and other devices, the corrosive, mean and hostile WhatsApp chats. Unfortunately I could go on.

At every turn the evidence has been devastating. Dysfunctional, it most certainly was. Time doesn't permit an examination of it all in this closing address and we will of course follow up with greater detail in writing, but allow me to touch on some.

It's entirely right that I should acknowledge at the outset that in January 2020 we had a fledgling Assembly, ministers, officials, advisers and support staff, all keen, some green, all determined to get to work on the issues of the day, not expecting that that issue was to be a fast-approaching global health pandemic.

While doubtless they were willing to put in the hours as they increasingly, albeit belatedly, realised the weight of responsibility that lay on their shoulders, they were caught unaware and hopelessly ill prepared.

You have been told repeatedly that everybody was motivated for the right reasons and that, my Lady, may well be true, but the road to ruin is paved with good intentions, and good intentions, my Lady, is no substitute for prompt and decisive action, political maturity and good leadership.

But from the outset, decisive action, political maturity and good leadership were in remarkably short supply.

My Lady, we know the warning signs had reached Northern Ireland by, at the latest, 25 January, when the CMO received the Professor Woolhouse email. That email chain made clear that the statistics were grave and unlikely -- and likely to be particularly grave for older people and those who were medically vulnerable.

It was or should have been, you were told by your experts, obvious at an early stage that a cross-governmental response was required, and yet it was to be almost a full eight weeks before that realisation was reached in Stormont. That was precious time that we couldn't afford to lose.

We have witnessed, both in writing and in evidence, the unedifying finger pointing as to whose fault that might have been. The Department of Health, determined to take the lead at the time but working in a silo, would like it to be recorded that the Executive Office could have stepped up and stepped in at any time.

That is undoubtedly correct. It was the First Minister and deputy First Minister who rejected the invitation to Exercise Nimbus, it was they who were demonstrably content to let Health take the lead, who thought of this as a health pandemic until it was too late.

The protestations of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, that they were out of the loop or that the political structures in Northern Ireland militated against them getting involved, must be viewed against the reality that they did not try to get involved. They did not attempt to peer over the walls of the silo nor ask for information to be brought to them.

But it's equally true that Minister Swann and Mr Pengelly held their grip too tightly for too long. Why wasn't there a report back after Nimbus directly to the First Ministers pointing out that the response needed to be cross-governmental and preparations needed to be stepped up? Why didn't they, as the letter of 6 February 2020 advised, trigger central crisis arrangements when Covid arrived on our shores at the latest by 27 February 2020, or, as you queried, my Lady, perhaps even before that date still?

The response from Mr Swann and Mr Pengelly of "Well, the TEO didn't ask" or "Well, they could have triggered it without us asking for it", is immature and self-justifying.

What about the Civil Service? Officials had been in post when ministers were not, senior roles occupied by experienced civil servants such as Chris Stewart or David Sterling, from whom you heard. They gave, my Lady, deeply dissatisfactory evidence. Mr Stewart knew, and had been repeatedly forewarned by Bernie Rooney about the dire state of civil contingencies. The CCPB was, she told him in autumn 2019, not fit for purpose. Yet with a pandemic looming throughout February 2020, it appears it was business as usual for Mr Stewart.

You will well recall the paper presented to the Executive Office board on 25 February which seeks a review of civil contingency arrangements, remarkably, and I quote, "for an unforeseen emergency event or situation", in which Covid gets a single mention, and even then only in passing.

We expect you will easily reject his account that this was an example of forward planning for a time after Covid while work on the pandemic preparedness was well under way. Rather, there was none of the requisite sense of urgency to build up civil contingencies for the threat that was very much already upon us.

Sir David Sterling's evidence provided no more comfort. Insistent though he was that there was "ongoing engagement" and that, as he put it, there would have been regular reviewing of things, on a daily basis, there is, regrettably, precious little to show for that. It appears that, notwithstanding the accepted need for cross-governmental preparations, the answer to Ms Dobbin's repeated questions as to who was over all the plans, who understood how they intersected with each other, who had that role, remains elusive.

Mr Stewart might have had some responsibility for that at early stages, liaising with permanent secretaries, Sir David perhaps later, neither of them at any stage advising ministers that the time had come for a meaningful cross-governmental response.

The proof, my Lady, comes on or about 15 March, when Karen Pearson is approached over the course of that Bank Holiday weekend and has to start the strategic response from scratch, without so much as a Post-it note from her colleagues to go on. To her credit, she gets to work, and in that environment, that had been without structure until that point, it's not difficult to understand why the deputy First Minister, Ms O'Neill, described her arrival as a breath of fresh air.

Sir David was keen to stress that the Civil Service hadn't been asked to activate NICCMA until on or about 15 March, offering with it what he termed a concession that it might have been done a few days before.

My Lady has already seen there has been much discussion about whose responsibility it was to trigger NICCMA. We saw the NICCMA protocol as recently as yesterday. We see the details of the list of those who can request for it to be activated, lead government department, senior PSNI officers and so on. The list does not include the Chief Medical Officer, and yet, according to Sir David, it was the Chief Medical Officer who asked for NICCMA to be activated on 14 or 15 March. The Chief Medical Officer.

If that is correct, then we owe the CMO a debt of gratitude for at least someone finally got there. But why was it not the Department of Health, the Minister of Health, the Executive Office themselves? And if it was the CMO in what capacity did he do that: in his role as a senior manager within the Department of Health or as an independent medical adviser for a nation in the grips of a pandemic?

Of course, my Lady, that was not the only occasion when the role of the CMO appears to stray far from a job description, if indeed there is such a thing. It must of course be acknowledged that the CMO worked tirelessly. Perhaps more than anyone we can see the product of his work through the thousands of pages of disclosure, of emails, of directions, of attendance at meetings at all levels, of statements that he produced. And it's important that that is acknowledged.

However, you will want to consider carefully Bernie Rooney's account of the CMO's telephone call to her on 30 January, when she responsibly, fully, and on the instructions of her manager, sought to brief the First Minister and deputy First Minister on the COBR meeting the day before.

Was it really for the CMO to intervene in Ms Rooney's Executive Office function? Even if he did think that the briefing prepared by Ms Rooney and approved by the Deputy CMO was so inadequate as to require his amendment, was there no way of achieving that without asserting that all future Executive Office submissions must personally be signed off by him?

My Lady, given his role in the Department of Health and the much prized departmental independence, is that not a clear conflict between his departmental role and his independent CMO role?

On 16 March in the Executive meeting it was noted by Baroness Foster that schools would close "when the CMO advised it". A seismic decision delegated to the CMO. It was the CMO who signed the MoU, the memorandum of understanding, with the Republic, a document that he was -- that was the product of a meeting between heads of state just a few weeks prior, and which really did call for cross-governmental buy-in.

Is it because that MoU was a CMO or Department of Health-led document that it appears that it failed to deliver what it promised in a pandemic that everyone seems to agree called for a five-nation, two-island approach?

My Lady, you asked Mr Poots about who would take important decisions about the safety of mass gatherings to be permitted to proceed in the North? In trying to understand where the power to take that kind of decision that would impact on people's lives would lie, you asked him, "Well, would it be the First Minister or the deputy First Minister?"

Mr Poots was ultimately unable to help in his evidence. But the answer might, surprisingly, come in a text message between the CMO and the CSA on 23 June 2020, in which the CMO indicates that Mr Poots had connected with him to discuss a drive-in concert planned for 3 July. In fact, open source media reports indicate that there was a three-day series of music events planned in the Titanic Quarter. It appears from the message exchange that Mr Poots was lobbying the CMO to ensure that those concerts would proceed, including with options for patrons to mingle outside their cars.

My Lady, that a senior minister in the Executive Office was turning not to his Executive colleagues but to the CMO for decisions of that nature is staggering, and it lays bare a problem in our power structure, one to which we will return in writing.

My Lady, exactly a week after Mr Poots' plea to ensure those concerts would proceed, on 30 June Sinn Féin ministers attended the Bobby Storey funeral. The sight of that funeral, played and replayed as it was on TV screens, was breathtakingly insensitive. It caused hurt, anger and outrage to the bereaved and all who stood with them and behind them.

While apologies have been fulsome in hindsight, it remains staggering that those who attended did not have the foresight to understand the hurt that they would cause to the public and to the Executive, or if they did, they attended regardless. It should not have happened and its consequences were grave.

There are no statistics available as to the impact of that display on public behaviours, but coming out of restrictions and coming into summer 2020, it's entirely reasonable to assume that some members of the public, angered by the sense of "one rule for us and another for them", cast aside any caution and lost confidence in the Executive in a way that was never to be fully restored.

The immediate cessation of public press conferences delivered a blow to what had been a united presentation by the Executive, which we know is relatively rare in any circumstance. Even when those press conferences resumed in September, a line wasn't drawn under it, and we have seen in this room that it continues to infect relations.

You pushed Sir David Sterling on this, my Lady: what was the impact of that attendance on the functioning of the Executive? There was, he told us, a discernible chill in relations. The public manifestation was a cessation of press conferences, but actually, he said, it was business as usual behind the scenes.

My Lady, I don't know if you expected a different answer from Sir David, but to those of us from here, that answer was entirely predictable. Grand public gesture politics, all the while business as usual behind the scenes.

My Lady, Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice are tired of it. They had every right to be angry at the Sinn Féin attendance at that funeral. Angry they were and angry they remain. They had every right to expect that in mature political discussions that behaviour would be thoroughly condemned. But they also had every right to expect that mature political leaders would find a way through it, with minimal impact on public confidence and the work of the Executive.

We know, however, not least from the evidence of Baroness Foster yesterday, that it continues to infect political discussions into autumn 2020 and beyond.

My Lady, Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice and many of those who stand with them are tired of political point-scoring being valued above political progress.

It's a shocking further indictment of our Executive that, having largely drifted towards decisions that were ultimately imposed on them from Westminster in March 2020, when the time came in autumn to actually make Northern Ireland specific decisions, supported by an enhanced understanding of this virus as well as Northern Ireland specific data and recommendations, which we know was not available in March, the Executive got it so very, very wrong.

We saw yesterday, so expertly developed by Ms Dobbin, the information that was available to the Executive, the advice that was given, the decisions that were called for. We know that the position of the First Minister in particular, written in a letter to the head of the Civil Service as far back as 29 March 2020, but publicly stated often thereafter, was:

"We must follow medical and scientific advice at all times. Politics should play no part in the decisions made."

A laudable aim, but one that was not to withstand the test of time.

My Lady, the facts of autumn 2020 have been rehearsed and need no elucidation. The deliberate and orchestrated deployment of a cross-community vote by the DUP in an Executive meeting that was not going their way was, as Minister Long put it, an egregious abuse of power. They had no choice, we're told, but to do so. That was claimed as recently as yesterday.

They had a very simple choice, my Lady. They could have chosen to respect the rights of the majority of their colleagues, to unite across departments, across communities, across political persuasions, but in opposition to them. But they couldn't allow themselves to be outnumbered, even in the face of public health measures that were strongly recommended and were to prove all too necessary.

My Lady, the first responsibility in a democratic society is to protect and safeguard the lives of its citizens. It's impossible to divorce that unedifying debacle in November 2020 from the chaos in the run-up to Christmas and from that shocking spike in deaths in early 2021.

Standing in stark juxtaposition in autumn 2020, in our mind's eye we can see Marion Reynolds standing on that patch of grass outside Marie's window, watching her aunt fade away before her eyes, unable, even with her own professional experience, to navigate the care system to ensure her aunt got the level of care and support that she both needed and richly deserved.

And those of us who can only see that in our mind's eye are the lucky ones. Too many others recall being in that situation, painfully disempowered and yet accepting, because they were told it was for the greater good, not willing to go into the homes of their elderly parents who needed their support so much, staying away from hospitals where loved ones were dying.

From the very onset of the pandemic, older people and the medically vulnerable were failed. The discharge of hundreds of people from hospitals to their own homes, to care homes, to our communities, was carried out, we have learned in this module, without meaningful or effective pre-planning on how best to protect older people or those who rely on residential or domiciliary care, and it was carried out and put into practice without any input from the Chief Medical Officer or any consultation with the Chief Scientific Adviser.

As a policy, it has been variously described to you as very clearly "potentially disastrous" and "quite reckless" by Mr Lynch, a policy got badly wrong by Mr Poots, and a failure by Lord Weir.

My Lady, it was all that and more. While of course the discussion of this module focused on care homes, it must be remembered and acknowledged that the reality was much broader and the ramifications went right through our communities. Deaths at home, deaths in hospital, deaths of children, deaths of those with disabilities, must not be overlooked in this module or indeed in future.

My Lady, in conclusion, we commend Ms Dobbin King's Counsel and her team who have undertaken a Herculean task in these last three weeks, but even Ms Dobbin could only scratch the surface of what was happening and what was not happening here in Northern Ireland, not for want of skill or want of determination but for want of time. At the end of just 11 days of evidence, in some respects we have watched the trailer to a film. We, the press and the public, have had a glimpse at the highlights and the low points of the Northern Irish Covid story, but the real film, the longer, the more detailed story, remains to be fully understood.

To some extent we will return to it in future modules, but long before we get together again in the autumn, it really is for our newly-formed Assembly, at this time, in 2024, to get to work, to consider for themselves the full story, to understand and to learn from those scenes that have been and have not been played out in these hearings, and to start to put right the wrongs, the errors, the gaps and the oversights, so that no longer can it be said that our government was so unprepared and so ill equipped for a health pandemic or any other equivalent emergency.

My Lady, you have now reached the end of Module 2. We hope you have enjoyed your time in Belfast. You will now, we know, begin to draw together the evidence that you've heard, to reach your conclusions and to draft your recommendations. And we await them eagerly. But in relation to many of the issues, there is no need for our administrative and political leaders to wait or to delay. Many gaps have been exposed, promises to learn lessons have been made from that seat in that witness box. There is a great deal of work to be done by those who represent us.

If I may borrow the words of the late Mo Mowlam, a woman who made an enormous impact on this part of the world, the message from the Northern Ireland bereaved to those who represent us is, now, "Bloody well get on and do it."

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Campbell, I'm extremely grateful, thank you.

Mr Friedman, I think you're going next.
