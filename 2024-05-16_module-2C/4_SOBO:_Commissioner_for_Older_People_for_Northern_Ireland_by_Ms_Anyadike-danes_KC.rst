4. Submissions on Behalf of the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland by Ms Anyadike-danes KC
==========================================================================================================

**Ms Anyadike-Danes**: Thank you, my Lady, and thank you for affording me the opportunity to address you at the end of these 11 days of oral hearings.

As my Lady knows, I act on behalf of the Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland and his office was established in 2011 with the principal aim of safeguarding and promoting the interests of older people in Northern Ireland, a group who at the last census in 2021 represents approximately 23% of the total population, and it is a growing group.

For the purposes of the Act, older people are defined solely by the fact that they are 60 years or older and, as such, they represent a cross-section of society, and whilst there are those who are healthy and should have a good quality of life for many years, nonetheless, as a group, they are more highly represented in the Northern Ireland figures of those with disabilities, mental health issues, comorbidities and those on hospital waiting lists, and they require not just health services but most especially social services.

A considerable number of them live and are cared for in community placements, provision of which is outsourced by their health and social care trusts to privately-owned providers.

None of this is new. Accordingly, the Department of Health as the lead department in the government's response to the pandemic should have factored it into the planning and the response to the pandemic and the government should have ensured that it was properly addressed in its response, and we're here because they did not, and older people and others who were known to be vulnerable paid a terrible price for that failure, and their families are living with its consequences.

The issue for the Commissioner is how and why that happened. This is the learning that he hopes the Inquiry will identify, and in fact to a large extent it has already identified it. The older people that the Commissioner represents now are largely those who directly experienced the consequences of the government's planning and decision-making and survived it. Many of them lived through life-changing events. They are seeking to make sense of what happened, and to know changes will be made to ensure that other older people do not have to endure anything similar or lose their lives as so many did. They hope that this will be done through the recommendations that you, my Lady, will make, and also the focus that the public can bring on what the government does with those recommendations.

The purpose of this closing is to highlight some of what the evidence has shown in relation to just two principal issues, because we can deal at greater length in the written.

Firstly, the apparent absence of section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act in planning and decision-making. Secondly, areas for improvement.

So starting with section 75, that places a statutory obligation on public authorities in carrying out their functions to have due regard for the need to promote equality of opportunity, which includes access to appropriate health and social care services, between what are known as the nine protected categories.

Older people feature heavily in two of those categories, age and persons with disabilities. They are also highly represented in those requiring the health and social care services. By the beginning of 2020, when the prospect of a pandemic was beginning to be recognised and that steps would need to be taken to protect the public, the Department of Health would have had decades of experience of applying section 75.

Consideration of the protected categories should have been embedded in the very DNA of the approach to all public sector decision-making, including civil contingency planning. The whole of Northern Ireland now knows the extent to which older people and others who are in those protected categories were particularly adversely impacted by the government's response to the pandemic, and no matter how many times the numbers of them who suffered and died of Covid is stated, it still has the capacity to shock, and so it should. It will remain a lasting shame.

What this hearing has exposed is the extent to which section 75 was not properly factored into the planning and decision-making of the government's response to the pandemic. At times it seems as though years of accepted practice on the implications of section 75 were ignored in the face of the looming pandemic, notwithstanding the knowledge that those whose lives were most at risk were in those protected groups. The evidence on this is stark.

Jenny Pyper acknowledged that the extent of the impact of NPIs on different groups within society was not assessed in any systematic way, and while she states that initially the pace of decision-making was such that it simply was not possible to do the normal section 75 or EQIA reviews that would have been a part of Civil Service process, she concedes that an opportunity was missed by the Covid Taskforce to perhaps have an equality workstream. This could have considered the huge amount of information from the social care system. It would also have provided a direct contact for Disability Action and the Commissioner for Older People, and a means of providing stakeholder involvement.

But that didn't happen. Karen Pearson acknowledged that "we could have done more, we should have done more ... should have found a way to make time", and it was a failure of planning in the months leading up to March 2020, when it was known there would be a pandemic, that time wasn't used to think about the impact that there would almost certainly be on a number of different people in society.

Dr Joanne McClean also acknowledged that there should have been a broader risk assessment role for the PHA about the particular vulnerabilities, for example, of disabled people in the community and helping to inform decision-making, but none of that explains why there was such a glaring omission from planning, especially when the likely consequences of it for the vulnerable are entirely foreseeable. Without an insight into and understanding of why it happened, it's difficult to exclude the possibility of it happening again, and the closest explanation lies in the evidence on the role and focus of the department and its Chief Medical Officer.

So, for example, the evidence of Edwin Poots, he acknowledged the failure to take into account older people, disabled people, young people, as the focus was almost entirely on our response to Covid-19 to the complete ignorance of anything else, and with that focus being driven by the Department of Health and the advice of Professor Sir Michael McBride, the CMO.

So, section 75 failure is just one example, unfortunately, of a wider failure in pre-pandemic planning and of decision-making throughout the duration of the pandemic. Any planning for a Northern Ireland response to a health pandemic would need to take in the distinctive features of its structures and population.

Northern Ireland has an integrated health and social care system, your Ladyship has heard about that. The evidence of Richard Pengelly was that, in the context of the pandemic, that could have been an advantage, as it should have provided greater oversight, but he had to concede that the integration was more illusory than real and there were no tangible benefits for the patients.

The Commissioner for Older People's evidence was perhaps more direct: it could have been an advantage, should have been an advantage, but the opportunities for it to be so were wasted. Instead, it operated to the detriment of those in care homes.

It was generally accepted during the hearing that Northern Ireland's health and social care system was extremely fragile, it had insufficient funds and not enough staff. The delivery of social care was heavily dependent on the private sector and it was in urgent need of reform.

Also none of that was new, as it had been an ongoing discussion for 30 or 40 years and is the subject of detailed reports. However, the evidence shows that there was nonetheless a failure to factor in the implications of those structural weaknesses and its frailties into planning. And while Sir David Sterling claimed that the knowledge that the Bengoa report was sitting on the shelf waiting to be taken forward would have been at the front of all ministers' minds in January and February of 2020, and that there would have been a recognition that the health service would be under particular stress which would be exacerbated by the structural problems which had built up over the years, amazingly the understanding of this did not seem to have crystallised until in and around the start of March. Consequently, there would not have been time for much, if any, of that to have influenced pre-pandemic planning, and indeed it seems clear that it didn't.

However, that could all have happened subsequently, when the transmission rate of Covid-19 started to rise markedly and a government response was required, those weaknesses in the structure for delivering adult social care and their implications could and should have been appreciated and factored into planning to avoid potentially disastrous outcomes for older people later on, and again it seems clear that didn't happen, or at least not to any appreciable extent, and, to use the Commissioner's words, older people were left horribly exposed.

Well, so much for what should have been factored in. That leaves the inevitable question of: when should it have been factored in?

The graphic that the Inquiry produced showing the two waves is remarkably stark. Whereas the first wave in Northern Ireland was bad, the second wave was worse. It was higher, and more prolonged. Those waves and the concentration of deaths amongst older people and other vulnerable groups represent what the government should have been seeking to avoid with early and appropriate information and planning. However, the distinct impression from listening to the evidence over these 11 days is that there was a lack of urgency, and that is simply incomprehensible in the circumstances.

The timeline shows that the first SAGE meeting on Covid took place on 22 January, the first COBR meeting on 24 January, the CMO had his first engagement with other UK CMOs that day, and the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which is comprised mainly of infectious disease modellers, met on 27 January.

Robin Swann, as Minister of Health, attended the COBR meeting on 29 January, and attended SAGE meetings, the first being on 6 February. The following day WHO declared Covid-19 a public health emergency and the next day the UK had its first confirmed case. On 4 February WHO published guidance on scaling up country preparedness and response operations, and then there is a significant period, in the context of the pandemic, until the first case is confirmed in Northern Ireland on 27 February.

There was time. The information the Department of Health obtained from these early meetings and the regular attendance of its officials at that time would have left them in no doubt about the seriousness of the position and the implications of that for Northern Ireland, given the state and capacity of its health and social care system. But unfortunately, it did not seem to lead to a commensurate level of urgency, whether in the pre-pandemic phase and prior to the first wave or after the first lockdown and prior to the second wave.

A striking illustration of that is the position of Professor Ian Young. He went on leave on 12 February 2020, seemingly without having made any contribution to pre-pandemic planning, but, more importantly, without any replacement or even arrangement for one having been made, and it appears little was done by way of modelling or the provision of the scientific advice that he would have been expected to provide until his return at the end of March. The explanation was there were insufficient data points at that stage, effectively there was no basis from which to develop a model.

However, the UK modelling group met before there were any confirmed Covid-19 cases, and also Professor Young went on leave after a series of COBR and SAGE meetings when there were already worrying signs as to the potential rate of Covid transmission and its seriousness, yet he does not seem to have indicated what might be done in his absence or to have any recommended liaison with UK modellers and/or their counterparts in Germany and Italy, which already had cases, so that preliminary work could start.

There is no explanation of why, since at the time he left he would have no idea whether Northern Ireland could afford to wait until his return at the end of March before getting started on modelling. A lack of urgency, an inconsistency which typified the government's response.

The Inquiry has many examples from which to conclude that the period leading up to Christmas in which the restrictions were imposed, lapsed, brought back in again, was the very antithesis of what planning during the pandemic should be.

Senior counsel for the bereaved has only so eloquently listed some of them and your own senior counsel has also, very well indeed, exposed them.

The evidence from Baroness Foster on her response to the urgings of the Minister of Health and CMO to implement a lockdown circuit-breaker as the situation became far more serious than in March are just difficult to understand. The source of any expert advice to justify her contrary view to what they were urging then is entirely unclear, including to allow aspects of society to remain open and available to people.

Given the risks to older people in care homes and vulnerable people in the community and to hospital capacity, it's difficult to know what to make of her statement that for, and I quote now:

"... but for those of us who need to get our hair cut every couple of weeks, it was becoming a real issue ..."

Or that coffee shops had bought stock in the anticipation of opening and:

"... if we hadn't allowed them to open for that week all of that stock would have been lost ..."

Decision-making on something as serious as the protection of vulnerable lives seemed to descend into chaos.

So then now finally what needs to be improved.

Older people and the public in general were repeatedly told: we're all in it together. But they were not, in any meaningful sense. Older people in care homes and the disabled and socially disadvantaged did not have an equal experience of either the pandemic or the impact of the government's response to it. They suffered, and died, in disproportionately high numbers. The Commissioner hopes that recommendations can be made to inform planning for the future and to minimise the risk of that happening again.

Dr Joanne McClean identified an important part of the problem lay with the health inequalities in society, and that was contributed to by socioeconomic circumstances and education level, and she acknowledged that there is an onus on the Executive and on government to realise that there are unfair inequalities that need to be tackled, not just because they caused an issue in the pandemic but just because they can and should be tackled. Addressing that probably lies outside the scope of this module. However, in the light of the evidence heard, the Commissioner suggests the following could contribute to improved planning and decision-making in preparing and responding to a health pandemic.

First, establishing a better structure for providing the Executive with timely, independent, specialist advice including re-considering the roles of the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Adviser. The evidence showed that the CMO's multiple roles could become blurred and his position as a departmental official deprived the Executive and other departments of a properly independent view. They had no basis from which to properly assess the advice he was giving them.

Two, ensuring that greater significance is given to the role of the Chief Social Work Officer. It was known that older people in care homes or in receipt of domiciliary care were likely to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic and many of the restrictions imposed. So the lack of reference to any significant input from the Chief Social Work Officer for planning is striking.

Three, developing a mechanism to better use the available experience and expertise of those in the third sector and bodies such as the Commissioner. This would have improved the government's planning and response at the time and could have avoided some of the chaos that undermined public confidence and compliance. The offer by Karen Pearson to talk to equality groups about doing more in civil contingencies space and developing a civil contingency risk register will force a consideration of vulnerability in section 75, is a welcome start. But what is required is a proper structure so that it is more than a commitment from an albeit dedicated individual.

Then just to conclude, my Lady, the Commissioner was hoping that there would be answers and an understanding of how and why vulnerable older people were so badly failed by the Northern Ireland Government's response to the pandemic. Regrettably, the answer to the "how" question is far more deeply depressing and concerning than he thought possible, whilst the answer to the "why" question is not really there.

In his view, it needs to be, not least to build the public's trust and confidence in the government's ability to adequately respond to the next pandemic so that lives are protected. The evidence heard has done little to start that process, but it must happen, because without such trust and confidence the public may not respond with the necessary compliance to whatever measures are considered necessary in the future, and that will be to the detriment of everyone.

Thank you very much indeed.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed.

Mr Phillips.
