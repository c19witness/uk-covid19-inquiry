10. Submissions on Behalf of the Association of Directors of Public Health by Mr Ford KC
========================================================================================

**Mr Ford**: Thank you, my Lady.

My Lady, I appear on behalf of ADPH, the Association of Directors of Public Health. Before I briefly explain what the association is and what its position is in respect of the issues with which this module of the Inquiry is concerned, I want to read these words from Professor Jim McManus, who is the president of the association and who will be giving evidence in week 4:

"Over 225,000 people in the UK alone lost their lives to this virus, with many people experiencing the enduring pain of long Covid and, as we have heard, many who have lost loved ones and colleagues and care and health staff who have experienced significant trauma. Our hearts are with them all. The scale of this loss heightens considerably the fundamental moral obligation on all of us to ensure that when the next pandemic comes, as it will, we are absolutely prepared to respond in a way which delivers the minimum possible loss of life and harms to people, keeping faith with those who have been lost, bereaved or harmed entails that, above all else, we lay seriously to heart this serious shared obligation to articulate systems, structures, working cultures and behaviours which will deliver that goal."

My Lady, the ADPH is the representative organisation of the directors of public health across the UK. The association is, along with the Local Government Association and its equivalents in the devolved nations, the only voice of localism that the Inquiry is going to hear in this module.

The role of the directors of public health have been likened to that of a local chief medical officer. Their role is similar across the UK, although there are some differences between the public health systems in which they operate. As you've heard, I think from Mr Keith, in England every local authority with public health responsibility must employ a specialist DPH, they're jointly employed by authorities in the DHSC.

Directors retain the primary responsibility for the health of their communities and are accountable for the delivery of their authority's public health duties. The director is a statutory chief officer of their local authority and the principal adviser on all health matters to elected members and officials.

In Scotland and Wales, directors are employed by NHS health boards, while in Northern Ireland the sole DPH is accountable to the Chief Medical Officer. Directors are also present in Crown dependencies and overseas territories, functioning as both directors of public health and the chief medical officer for their respective jurisdictions.

My Lady, the association wants to convey to the Inquiry some key messages about resilience and preparedness for pandemics at a local level. I'll summarise those messages now, and they will be expanded on by Professor McManus when he gives his evidence and developed later in closing written and oral submissions.

The position of the association is that there was, in the latter part of the period with which this module of the Inquiry is concerned, an insufficient understanding of the role, capabilities and responsibilities of directors of public health at a national level, and as a consequence they were largely omitted from the systems, processes and plans that had begun to be put in place at that point.

Directors of public health are trained in containing infectious diseases, understanding and interpreting data, recognising risk factors, understanding the evidence base and what motivates behavioural change, and helping develop local policy interventions.

Directors also have a deep knowledge of their local populations and community organisations. While the directors were working at a local level at the start of the pandemic, they were repeatedly excluded from key communications and guidance developed at a national level. They should have been consulted earlier, and more comprehensively, by national bodies with responsibility for health protection from the outset.

There are some striking examples of this, as you will hear in the evidence. Firstly, at the start of the pandemic, the Department of Health and Social Care did not hold an up-to-date contact list for the directors of public health in the various local authorities.

Secondly, at the start of the pandemic, directors were learning about new policies and guidance at the same time as members of the public were, when the televised 5 pm daily briefings began to be broadcast. They were expected to implement these policies without the necessary structures and support mechanisms having been put in place. Along with several other core participants, ADPH was asked by the Inquiry to canvass the views of its members, which it did by means of a survey, and the majority of its members felt that initially there were very limited routes available to them to engage with the national approach and that during those initial stages of the pandemic it's widely felt that the local voice was neither wanted nor heard.

Thirdly, directors of public health and their teams have extensive experience of contact tracing, their local communities and the wider health and social care system. Within local government there were environmental health officers and public health specialists with the skills to support contact tracing efforts in response to the virus. However, the involvement of local councils and directors in the test and trace service was, at the beginning of the pandemic, very limited. Local capacity to carry out testing and contact tracing was not recognised at a national level.

Returning, my Lady, to the survey, directors were asked what were the top five factors which most negatively impacted on their state of readiness, and these were their responses.

One, national guidance relating to pandemic preparedness did not anticipate the nature of the challenges provided by Covid-19.

Two, full lockdown was never anticipated as a reasonable worst-case scenario, so plans did not reflect the challenges that such a lockdown would raise.

Three, inadequate and unclear communication and support from central government.

Four, inadequate capacity in the public health workforce.

Five, inadequate funding. It is the view of the association that across the public health system funding and staffing levels have been run down to such an extent at all levels that response to the Covid-19 pandemic was severely hampered.

You will note, my Lady, that many of those five points, if not all of them, have been raised by other core participants already in their opening submissions.

Directors also identified the issue of data sharing. This was a key challenge in the early stages of the pandemic. The ability of directors to establish effective data sharing protocols varied significantly both across England and the devolved nations.

Statutory data protection requirements were rightly or wrongly thought to be an obstacle to data sharing, and different organisations had markedly different interpretations of their data protection obligations.

Although beyond the remit of this module, it's right to observe that, as the pandemic progressed, there was increasing recognition of the value of local leadership as a vital component of the pandemic response. Directors were brought in to provide a local perspective and inform the design of the system. They worked at pace to develop local outbreak plans, ensure the challenges of Covid-19 were understood, and address the impact on local communities, but there were, in the view of the association, numerous missed opportunities early on.

Overall, my Lady, the association's view is that the UK was inadequately prepared for a pandemic of this nature. At a local level, directors working in partnership with local authorities, the NHS, voluntary sectors and other emergency responders, had plans in place for an influenza pandemic, for the reasons that you've already heard, and did their best to adapt those arrangements to meet the challenges presented by Covid-19. In future, national and local plans will need to be more flexible to respond to different types of viruses and threats.

Looking forward, the association's view is that much greater local involvement is needed in formulating national policy. This means bringing bodies together such as the ADHP, the Local Government Association, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and Association of Directors of Children's Services, along with their devolved equivalents, to combine and inform the national response. There needs to be greater recognition of the role of local public health and local government in the planning of future pandemics. In the association's view, a key lesson is that local-driven processes and responses are more speedy and effective than those prescribed centrally through top-down approaches and enable improved co-ordination and collaboration between agencies. It's important that the UK Government understands the distinct role of directors of public health when engaging locally.

My Lady, finally, returning to the survey, the directors were asked to suggest ways for improved preparedness and resilience, and these are the top ten points which they raised.

Firstly, putting in place arrangements to enable data and intelligence to flow more freely from national agencies to local public health teams, organisations and authorities.

Secondly, improved transparency and timeliness of communications from national government.

Thirdly, national government should consider developing a national strategy around communications during an emergency and utilise the voice of trusted local leaders and the voluntary sector.

Fourth, conducting regular tests of preparedness to better equip the workforce to respond to pandemics by providing more training opportunities for relevant staff, in health protection and pandemic preparedness.

Fifth, widening the scope of emergency planning to be more inclusive of different emergencies and diseases and developing a national testing strategy early on.

Sixth, maintaining the relationships they formed during the pandemic with internal and external partners through the local resilience forums.

Seventh, better harnessing of the voluntary and community sectors and emergency planning strategy going forward.

Eighth, greater clarity around the role of the directors of public health and local authorities in pandemic preparedness and emergency planning.

Ninth, greater certainty around the public health grant and more funding for emergency planning and health protection.

Tenth, expanding the public health workforce.

My Lady, the aim of the association is to provide evidence to this Inquiry that informs better pandemic planning and preparedness. In summary, lessons point to three essential themes.

Firstly, improving the overall health of the UK, including reducing health inequalities. Secondly, clarifying the roles and responsibilities of key agencies and professionals at all levels. Thirdly, ensuring sufficient powers, capacity and resources are in place.

My Lady, we must learn these lessons from Covid and we must do better next time. Thank you very much.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Ford.

I think it's now Mr Allen.
