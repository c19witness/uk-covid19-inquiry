11. Submissions on Behalf of the Local Government Association and Welsh Local Government Association by Mr Allen KC
===================================================================================================================

**Mr Allen**: My Lady, thank you very much.

It's my privilege to represent the interests of the Local Government Association and the Welsh Local Government Association in this so important process.

The two associations work very closely together and welcome the opportunity to contribute as core participants in this module.

Together they represent the collected voice of local government, having 100% of the Welsh and over 99% of the English principal local authorities as members, and these are, of course, category 1 responders and core members of local resilience fora.

They applied to become core participants because local government and its officers played such a major role in bringing these countries through the pandemic.

There also can be no doubt that local government would be called on to play this role again, should there ever be another pandemic, and of course it would do so with total commitment.

My Lady, you will recall that during lockdown we were encouraged to go out and bang our saucepans to celebrate and acknowledge the contribution of key workers. The predominant media focus was on those who worked in the NHS. But the phrase "key workers" went much wider. Like the NHS, nearly all local government officers were engaged in the pandemic response. On average, only 1% of directly employed council staff were furloughed during 2020. In numerical terms, the role played by the local authority workforce was comparable to that of the NHS; in our areas, in full-time equivalent terms, about a million compared to 1.28 million.

It is, therefore, really important in this Inquiry that you and the wider public and media appreciate just how big a part local authorities had in bringing the country through. Political leaders of all parties have praised local authority officers for their dedication and flexibility, and so have business leaders.

So it may be surprising to say, but in this module it will, we believe, become clear that the fullest and necessary understanding of the role of local government should and could play in the pandemic was sometimes lacking within central government. So let me summarise now what local government did and would do again.

In the very shortest of terms it can be said that throughout the pandemic councils kept essential local services going. But they did considerably more than that. They stepped up to deliver a whole suite of new functions crucial to the response.

Putting it rather more fully, local government continued to have a major role in almost all of life's big moments, as well as the everyday services people rely on. Registering births, deaths, marriages and partnerships, protecting consumers, providing social housing, safeguarding children and young people, collecting waste, maintaining transport and other local infrastructure, providing open spaces for health and recreation, managing adult social care for the elderly and those who are otherwise clinically vulnerable, and, of course, ensuring that there continued to be mortuaries and cemeteries at end of life. Only very temporarily were some of these functions, but by no means all, suspended during the most restricted periods.

At the same time, they administered multimillion pound national financial assistance schemes for business. They ensured that those made vulnerable by the pandemic across the two countries were identified and protected. They supported local schools to maintain educational provision, and support for pupils. And they co-delivered test and trace and vaccination programmes to help control the spread of the virus.

And that is why such a very high proportion of local authority officers were designated as key workers, with many changing roles, to deal with the pandemic.

The associations emphasise, therefore, that in planning for civil contingencies no other body understands local areas better than their councils, and this has to be taken fully into account. The highly valued services they deliver were absolutely crucial to the Covid-19 response, by protecting both lives and livelihoods, and that would be so in another pandemic. And yet, as I've already alluded, one concern particularly affecting the LGA and the English local authorities is that too often during the pandemic central government did not fully understand the way local government in England worked and what it could contribute. On occasions, it has seemed as though there was a lack of trust in local authorities, even perhaps a misplaced confidence by central government as to what it could achieve by itself.

Now, I am glad to say that this was not evident in the relationship between the devolved government in Wales and the Welsh Local Government Association and Welsh local authorities. Both associations urge this Inquiry to conclude that in all planning for a future pandemic there must be a full recognition of the risks and responsibilities that local authorities will face and the contributions that they can make, and that any planning, whether on paper or in exercises to test resilience, that fails fully to include local government will always be incomplete.

We expect that by the end of your Inquiry, the huge contribution of local government should be as well known as that of the NHS, that the personal sacrifice, in some cases the ultimate sacrifice, the constant stress, danger to health, and many acts of great courage of local authority officers should be fully understood and better appreciated by you, central government, the media and the public, and that it will be realised in the future that more engagement by central government with local government can only enhance the quality of both contingency planning and emergency responses.

Now, this first module focuses on the steps taken in the period between 2009 and 2020 to prepare for a pandemic occurring at some time in the foreseeable future. In the view of both associations, the local government was generally well prepared for what central government had expected of councils in dealing with an influenza pandemic. But that of course is not at the heart of the Module 1 questions, and it is not to say either the resilience of health protection systems operated perfectly. On resilience matters, we expect the Inquiry to find that some guidance was out of date, that central government was not always willing to share information with local partners in a timely way, and in the run-up to 2020 attention was being diverted to other resilience issues such as the no-deal EU exit.

On health protection issues, we expect the Inquiry to find that central government policy making was undermined by its lack of understanding of the public health system which, at a national level, was complex and, on occasion, fragmented, and we echo, therefore, some of the points already made by the previous speaker.

Across these points, we expect the Inquiry to see that all local government services had been impacted by austerity. This, as we've heard, has gone on for a decade. The reductions in funding saw councils lose 60p out of every pound of funding, and that must be seen against rising demand in key services such as adult and children's social care and homelessness support.

Inevitably, this impacted the ability to plan, to prepare and resource, and the overall resilience of services.

Notwithstanding, my clients' witness statements set out the steps councils have taken around risk assessment and contingency planning, and testing and exercising, as well as the engagement by the two associations themselves, and councils consider that they well prepared for what was expected of them.

You will already know that local government was not in charge, though, of the process of pandemic planning. Its engagement was in response to requests and directions from central and devolved government, and it is clear, in hindsight, that there were significant gaps in the pandemic planning process by central government.

There was insufficient focus on the emerging infectious diseases such as MERS and SARS relative to the engagement on influenza. There was a failure to learn from how Asian countries were responding to these diseases. And in any event, the learning from previous incidents and exercises was not consistently applied.

Perhaps most seriously of all, none of the pandemic plans suggested non-pharmaceutical interventions such as national lockdowns, international travel restrictions, wholesale school and workplace closures, or compulsory quarantine. In no significant way was there any preparation for these, meaning that when the pandemic struck, new plans had to be developed from scratch.

It will be obvious in general terms -- and this will no doubt be discussed later in Module 2 in more specific terms -- that to make these NPIs work swiftly, efficiently and effectively required close local knowledge and support. The failure to think through fully how the rate of infection would have to be controlled during a pandemic was, therefore, a very significant omission. It became a matter of political dispute, when it ought to have been a matter of social planning well in advance.

The associations say that if it had been considered in advance, those difficult issues that had to be considered in the pandemic, that is to say effective subsidiarity, business continuity, human rights and the disproportionate impacts on minorities, could have been thought through and addressed in calmer times. When these matters were addressed, the skills that already resided within local government could have been engaged much more quickly and dynamically.

The lack of planning for these measures was subsequently compounded by an initial failure to recognise the vital role local government should play when systems were designed.

For instance, instead of developing from scratch a new test and trace system, the skills of the directors of public health in England and the Directors of Public Protection in Wales could have been harnessed at the outset.

How all this could have been done better in advance is, of course, the complex question for you in this module. As the events of 2020 to 2022 have shown, pandemics are complex social and behavioural challenges and not just technocratic issues.

So I want it make it clear that the approach of the two associations I represent is by no means a purely negative and critical one. Local government does not say that everything was wrong. It recognises that there were also many positives about a system with the capability and agility to quickly pivot from existing plans to respond to the pandemic. But it also says that these systems can and should be improved with local government treated as an equal partner in this.

And the associations hope that this too will form part of your conclusions.

My Lady, I want to move now to set out some summary points that the local government associations will be asking you to have in your recommendations, and I take them first from the evidence to be given by the chief executive of the Local Government Association, Mark Lloyd.

1. Improved democratic engagement with local resilience forums.

2. Amendment of the Civil Contingencies Act and delegated legislation to ensure it's more aligned to the issue of resilience.

3. Specific obligations on central government, on sharing critical planning information with local government.

4. Much greater emphasis on the importance of preparing for the implications for social care in the context of a pandemic.

5. Greater discussion of health protection in the preparations of a pandemic, including all forms of NPI and their different consequences for breaking infections whilst maintaining business continuity and civil society.

6. Greater understanding of the different roles of health protection obligations of councils and the more general role of local resilience fora.

7. A better collection of guidance information into one place.

8. Less secrecy in risk assessments .

9. Greater focus on local issues in risk assessments.

10. More systematised account of protected characteristics in emergency plans.

11. More work on public awareness campaigns.

12. Distinct data sharing plans to enable local government to act effectively and swiftly, for instance in identifying vulnerable persons.

13. More general planning for vulnerable persons.

Mr Chris Llewelyn, the chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association, mentions many of the same issues, but I would add to the previous list from his witness statement the following:

1. That there should be protocols and agreements for consistent intergovernmental planning and co-decision-making on a pan-UK scale as part of the devolution settlement.

2. Advance planning is necessary for Welsh local authorities having to manage different approaches being taken by the devolved and central governments, so as to avoid the confusion and tensions that can occur in cross-border areas.

3. Linking closely with the LGA's third point, there must be a much better and fuller direct interaction between central government and Welsh local authorities, where policy directions are UK-wide and not devolved, so as to enable immediate and consistent responsive action at the local level.

4. Contingency arrangements are needed for the urgent deployment of pre-trained and appropriately skilled officers into emergency command and advisory roles, and this should include civil servants in the UK and Welsh Government and also local government and emergency officers within local resilience fora partnerships and local government structures.

5. Contingency arrangements are also necessary for the passing of immediate and comprehensive legislation and guidance, with draft modular laws and statutory instruments and guidance held in reserve at both the UK and Welsh levels.

6. There is a need for reserve stocks at scale and for robust supply chains for the provision of specialist medical equipment and goods such as PPE, with specifications reviewed regularly to ensure compatibility for emerging viruses.

7. Resilient emergency planning is necessary for the expansion of the NHS facilities and services, to be able to co-manage the demands of a pandemic alongside critical and life-saving NHS services not related to the pandemic.

8. Reserve capacity, public sector workforce redeployment plans and logistical support and call-on contracts are necessary to stand up key support services such as mass testing, test and trace, and mass vaccinations.

9. There should be plans, resources and flexibilities for the full recovery of public services, which might not be able to resume in meeting their statutory performance standards and targets for some time post pandemic.

10. Again, related to the above LGA point 11, communication plans are necessary where there are differences of legal or administrative approach, and these should be planned for in advance.

11. Also like point 10 in the LGA, the Welsh Local Government Association emphasises the need for a more systematised approach to taking account of protected characteristics in emergency plans.

12. The Welsh Government should have more freedom in deciding its reserve levels for local authorities and the overall provision for greater emergency funding is essential if other services are not to be cut back.

And lastly:

13. There should be specific planning undertaken for the procurement of medical equipment for use within Wales.

My Lady, we thank you for this opportunity to make an opening statement, and the two associations will support you in your work in every way we possibly can. Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Allen.

We were meant to, I think, go to Mr Bowie now.

Mr Bowie, where are you? I'm just wondering, are you here tomorrow in any event? Or would you prefer to go now?

**Mr Bowie**: I don't mind, my Lady, I'm here tomorrow, whatever's easier.

**Mr Keith**: We do have now, fortuitously, a certain degree of flexibility tomorrow morning, if my Lady wished to go now.

**Lady Hallett**: If you don't mind, Mr Bowie, I think it's been a long day for quite a lot of people, so if that's all right with you?

**Mr Bowie**: Of course.

**Lady Hallett**: Very well, we'll start at 10 o'clock tomorrow, please, with Mr Bowie. And I hope that everyone has been okay today.

*(4.26 pm)*

*(The hearing adjourned until 10 am on Wednesday, 14 June 2023)*
