4. Submissions on Behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Lavery KC
========================================================================================================

**Mr Lavery**: Good afternoon, my Lady. At this stage, your Ladyship knows, but for anybody else watching, that I represent the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice and, in an approach to this which may find some model in some part of the findings of the Inquiry in the future, we've adopted a joined-up and coherent approach to making our oral and written submissions. So your Ladyship will see that we have produced a joint document, and I commend the submissions of Mr Weatherby to the Inquiry, and to you, my Lady. It is obvious I represent the Northern Ireland bereaved families who lost loved ones, young and old, in a variety of circumstances, including care homes, hospitals, and the community. Our families, my Lady, have been impressed by the robust approach that you and Mr Keith and his team are taking. You, my Lady, have -- and your team -- worked incredibly hard to get this Inquiry started in, despite press reports, such a short period of time and we have all, the core participants, been working hard and together with the Inquiry and with the Inquiry team.

From what was said by Mr Keith already this morning, we know that he has and you have, my Lady, been listening to the submissions that have been put in writing so far and are considering those very carefully. Our families have faith that this Inquiry will yield the results which they search for.

You know, my Lady, that this Inquiry isn't simply about taking a robust approach to individuals, such as former Prime Ministers. It's not a criticism, it's not an Inquiry which will deal with personal criticisms necessarily of those individuals. But of course we know that no individual is going to stand and no government department is going to stand in the way of progress of this Inquiry.

This Inquiry, as my clients know, is about the impact -- in this module -- about the impact the lack of preparedness had on them and on society as a whole.

As I said, we are here to support you, my Lady, in your task in finding out, in particular for our families from Northern Ireland, was Northern Ireland prepared, what lessons for the future can be learned, and should anyone or any body be made accountable?

There are three areas I just want to look at briefly, and they're the Civil Contingencies Act, which Mr Keith already referred to, some science, and some of the politics involved.

A large part of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 did not actually apply to Northern Ireland, and the problem was not just the devolution scheme but that in 2004 the Executive and Assembly were in suspension, Northern Ireland was under direct rule from Westminster, and the 2004 Act did not confer duties upon Westminster ministers, including those with direct rule powers in Northern Ireland at the time. There was no equivalent devolved legislation ever introduced, despite this being a key recommendation of the Cygnus report, and despite the Northern Ireland Secretary of State's expectation in 2005 that Northern Ireland would have "a similar level of protection for its citizens as experienced elsewhere".

The statutory obligations pertaining in Northern Ireland, in contrast to the rest of the UK, were mere guidance, my Lady.

The lack of cohesiveness is plain from the statement of Ms Allen from the Association of Local Authorities Northern Ireland. It conveys a sense that in the absence of statutory obligations on local authorities there was relative inaction with regard to planning and preparedness, with little, if any, formulation of preparedness policies. The people in Northern Ireland, therefore, were at a distinct disadvantage. They had less statutory protection compared to other citizens in the UK.

In terms of science, my Lady, there was a disjuncture between central and devolved government, and this is demonstrated in part by Professor Young, who was the part-time consultant and Chief Scientific Adviser, by his request to join the Chief Scientific Adviser UK network. This request was declined. Only one representative for each devolved administration was allowed.

There is no record of Northern Ireland participation in SAGE prior to 29 March 2020. Between 2009 to 2015, the Senior Medical Officer only had observer status, with no speaking rights at the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, and the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens.

Northern Ireland had no automatic representation at SAGE, and as McBride put it:

"Policymakers in Northern Ireland may have had more limited awareness of the extent to which uncertainty and a range of opinion is expressed in scientific discussion."

My Lady, Northern Ireland did not attend COBR meetings until 2 March 2020. The Inquiry, we say, should consider recommendations that ensure in future that Northern Ireland Chief Scientific Advisers become part of the UK network and SAGE, and to ensure Northern Ireland attendance at COBR meetings.

But, my Lady, there was a lack of knowledge among political leaders as well in relation to central government planning and preparedness and the reasons for it.

Michelle O'Neill, the First Minister Designate, accepts a lack of knowledge of or at least inability to recall Exercise Cygnus, despite it occurring while she was Minister for Health.

Arlene Foster, likewise, despite being First Minister during Operation Cygnus and the pandemic, does not recall being briefed, "as to the recommendations made on foot of Exercise Cygnus or any steps the Executive Office intended to take to improve pandemic preparedness prior to the Assembly collapsing in January 2017", nor does she recall any steps taken in relation to pandemic preparedness between January 2017 and January 2020.

We say this shows a low level of interest in or the impact which Cygnus had on Northern Ireland decision-making.

Michelle O'Neill's successor, Robin Swann, who was the Minister for Health during the pandemic, does recall Cygnus and states his belief that the flu plan provided a good foundation for action during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Inquiry, my Lady, should of course examine this assertion in light of its exclusive focus on the influenza pandemic.

In any event, it's clear that Northern Ireland devolved government failed to implement a coherent response to the pandemic, and you, my Lady, may well find that it was incapable of providing a coherent response.

A common theme that runs throughout, common themes, they are: the lack of statutory protection; lack of pandemic co-ordination; and, in general, a lack of preparedness for a pandemic.

The context of this is decades of political dysfunction in Northern Ireland. But, my Lady, as Brenda Doherty, who you saw earlier on the film and who made a statement and who you will hear from later on in this module, she put it in these terms, that -- and this is quoting from her statement:

"The vacuum in government was known not only to our members but also to the Westminster government. If that prolonged lack of an Executive was having a detrimental impact on the preparedness and resilience in respect of emergencies in this jurisdiction, the UK Government had a moral and constitutional duty to act to ensure that those living in this jurisdiction would not suffer as a result should there be any emergency."

Mr Keith referred earlier to the impact of EU exit preparations and, on 22 January 2020, the pandemic flu subgroup acknowledged that, due to the lack of work done and impact on staff resources because of the EU exit preparations, that Northern Ireland was more than 18 months behind the rest of the UK in terms of ensuring sector resilience to any pandemic flu outbreak.

My Lady, Mr Keith's remarks were made in terms of the UK generally, and it appears from that that we were even 18 months behind that again.

I mentioned Brenda Doherty, my Lady. Her mother, as you heard, Ruth Burke, died on 24 March 2020 .she was the fourth person to die from Covid in Northern Ireland, the first woman. She was admitted to hospital on 11 March because of high levels of warfarin. There was no testing of patients on admission. The only PPE she saw was a disposable apron. She asked the staff about Covid-19, because she had seen footage of it on television and of events in China and mainland Europe. She was told not to worry, it will all be over by the summer.

On 19 March, she arrived at the hospital and was told visiting was being stopped, but a nurse let in her for five minutes. At the end of the five minutes, her mother asked why she was leaving. She said she couldn't stay because of the coronavirus restrictions. She told her mum that she'd be home soon and that they all loved her. She waved bye bye and that was the last she saw of her mother.

On 23 March, she made a phone call to the hospital but was told that only limited information could be given on the phone but of course, my Lady, there was no other way to get information.

Half an hour after that, the Prime Minister announced the lockdown restrictions. She then later received a call asking if she agreed to no unnecessary intervention in relation to her mother, and she thought at that stage: is she going to make it? Can the family be there? And she was told no. Twelve hours later, she received a phone call to say that her mother had passed away without any of her family being by her side. There was, as she said, my Lady, no coming home, no seeing her in her coffin, no laying out of her clothes for her to be laid to rest in. The funeral she described. She waited outside locked cemetery gates for the hearse to arrive. There was no carrying of the coffin and the council workers were dressed in white clothes and there was red and white tape around the grave. It all lasted 15 minutes -- a "committal" she describes it as, rather than a funeral -- and afterwards they all walked back separately to their own houses.

That's one story, my Lady, but the themes in that story and other stories referred to and the other people in Brenda Doherty's statement are there. And then the themes of lack of communication, that not only did these people suffer the death of their loved ones from Covid, and in high proportion the elderly and the vulnerable, people who should have been protected, and like so many others her mother was given Covid in hospital.

Preparedness should be meaning the protection of the most vulnerable from death, but also preparedness ought to have contemplated, prepared for and prevented unnecessary or disproportionate, dehumanising, re-traumatising restrictions.

So many of our families, my Lady, are picking up the pieces from this clinical estrangement in the final phase of their loved ones' lives: no wake, human remains treated like toxic waste.

My Lady, preparedness and resilience is not just about science. It's about anticipating and minimising the holistic overall impact of a pandemic and its containment and eradication, the impact of that on human beings.

My Lady, our families know that there is no other person better equipped and suited with the forensic expertise and compassion to deliver the truth for the families of what happened, both in this module and the modules to come.

Thank you very much for listening to us today.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Lavery. You have made some very important points. Thank you very much.

I shall break now and return at 2.10.

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, I think we may have to reconvene at 2.00, only because we have quite a number of openings to get through this afternoon.

**Lady Hallett**: Okay, very well. Sorry. I'm completely misreading the clock. Forgive me everybody. Return at 2.00.
