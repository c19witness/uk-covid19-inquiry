9. Submissions on Behalf of the Northern Ireland Department of Health by Ms Murnaghan KC
=========================================================================================

**Ms Murnaghan**: That is correct, my Lady.

Good afternoon. I make this opening statement on behalf of the Northern Ireland Department of Health, which I will refer to in the course of the statement as being "the department".

The purpose, my Lady, of this opening statement is to outline the evidence that has and will be given in respect of the systems, the structures and the processes relevant to pandemic preparedness in Northern Ireland.

I wish to begin by conveying the department's sincere condolences to those who have suffered bereavement as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The department also expresses its sympathy and support for everyone across the country who is living with or who has suffered from this disease.

The department extends its sincere condolences to those who have lost loved ones or who have had their lives turned upside-down by this disease.

In our lifetime, this crisis was unprecedented, and the pandemic had a direct and dramatic impact on the daily lives of every single occupant of these islands. The department acknowledges the huge losses that many amongst us have suffered and, in some cases, continue to suffer.

The department also wishes to emphasise its gratitude to and support for healthcare workers. The department has an extraordinary appreciation and respect for healthcare workers who, during this pandemic, selflessly put their lives on the line to protect the whole of the community. These healthcare workers unflinchingly acted for the benefit of us all in times of great uncertainty and danger, and for that we thank them sincerely.

I also take this opening statement as an opportunity to clarify some of the important aspects of the structure of the department and the health and social care system in Northern Ireland.

The department's key statutory responsibilities arise on foot of the Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009. These core responsibilities are to promote an integrated system of health and social care so as to ensure improvement in the physical and mental health of people in Northern Ireland, in the prevention, the diagnosis and the treatment of illness, and in the social wellbeing of people in Northern Ireland.

Accordingly, the department is responsible for health and social care legislation and policy, and is the lead government department for responding to health consequences of emergencies. It was in this role that the department assumed responsibility for the health response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The department is headed by a Permanent Secretary. The role of the Permanent Secretary in the department is to act as the principal accounting officer and the principal adviser to the Minister for Health.

Another important aspect of the department's structures is that, until April 2022, it had 17 arm's length bodies. These arm's length bodies helped the department achieve its objectives. However, in March 2022 one of those arm's length bodies, namely the Health and Social Care Board, was dissolved and its functions were transferred back into the department. Those functions now reside within the newly established Strategic Planning and Performance Group that is held within the department. The functions, therefore, of the department and its arm's length bodies are often referred to by the umbrella term of health and social care", or HSC, and similarly reference is made to arm's length bodies as being HSC bodies.

However, the department believes that it is important to note that these terms are merely colloquialisms, and HSC is used as a shorthand for the health and social care system as a whole in Northern Ireland. There has never been an organisation called Health and Social Care Northern Ireland.

Whilst arm's length bodies are accountable to the department, again it is emphasised that they are themselves separate legal entities.

In these opening remarks, it is asserted that the department's main priority from day one was the protection of Northern Ireland's citizens from the virus and supporting efforts to contain the spread of the virus. In giving a very high level overview of the department's state of preparedness, it should be noted that there has been a clear structure providing a level of protection and emergency response to the people of Northern Ireland, which was consistent with elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

The Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework was first published in 2005, following the introduction of the Civil Contingencies Act in 2004. An updated version of the framework was published in 2011. This affords Northern Ireland the same level of protection and emergency preparedness as elsewhere in the UK.

Despite the framework not being a statutory instrument, it is implemented in the same way as if it were legislation. The framework required the department to maintain, review and update its emergency response plan.

The department undertakes emergency preparedness and planning on an ongoing basis in order to maintain readiness and to respond to any emergency with health and social care consequences.

As part of the department's responsibility for leading the health response to a pandemic, it participated in UK-wide pandemic influenza planning as well as participating in working groups and UK governance structures and a range of activities to test and exercise plans.

Consequently the department has been able to benefit from lessons learnt and revise the department's emergency response plan.

When the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern in January 2020, it became rapidly apparent that Covid-19 would challenge the existing emergency response mechanisms globally as well as in Northern Ireland.

The rapid spread of the virus also highlighted the importance of co-operation across UK and further afield and the sharing of information which the department carried out with its counterparts in the Republic of Ireland.

The department and its arm's length bodies activated their emergency response plans and followed the command and control structures, the systems and the processes which had previously been put in place to manage its response.

The experience of the pandemic has highlighted that the timely exchange of information and co-ordination of measures between the devolved administrations to assist in containing the spread of the virus was a crucial element for an effective and a coherent response.

Undoubtedly the department has benefited from the dedication of civil servants, of personnel in arm's length bodies, and from frontline HSC workers, all of whom worked tirelessly to manage and overcome the pandemic. Nevertheless, the department recognises that there are lessons to be learnt and hopes that this Inquiry will help us identify those lessons to ensure that it is better prepared for the future.

In this, the Inquiry's first module, the Inquiry's focus will be on preparedness of, amongst others, this department and its ability to scale up its pandemic plans in order to address the demands placed on the broader health and social care system. The department has provided evidence to the Inquiry in a range of areas, including how it was able to increase capacity for diagnosing, laboratory testing and procedures for testing and contact tracing, in consequence of the implementation and adaptation of their preparedness plans.

The department worked closely with health authorities and government departments across the UK and Ireland in a joint effort to significantly contribute to the general understanding of how the virus spread, in order to assist in controlling its further spread and to provide support as necessary.

It is also noted that additional funding was provided from the UK Government to assist in addressing the challenges of the pandemic. In circumstances such as a pandemic, the inescapable reality is that smaller administrations such as Northern Ireland will inevitably need to look to the more extensive resources in other parts of the United Kingdom in order to help it react in a timely way.

Furthermore, we consider it appropriate to highlight that all of the decisions required of the devolved administration were taken locally on advice from the Northern Ireland Civil Service. The pandemic planning and the system preparedness in Northern Ireland prior to March 2020, including those developments and changes which were implemented during the course of the pandemic, has been detailed in a number of statements lodged with the Inquiry from our key professionals.

We consider that the evidence submitted by the department has shown how continuous learning occurred throughout the pandemic. This learning was, in part, as a consequence of increased and evolving scientific understanding of the virus, of its transmission, the disease severity and development, and the persistence of immunity. Throughout these first stages there were improvements in Northern Ireland's reaction to the pandemic as a result of increased availability of testing, improvements in pandemic modelling, improved understanding of individual and population behaviours, and how they were influenced by modelling, and by the development of vaccines and how their rapid deployment was effected, as well as by the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We include in that contact tracing and isolation as well as novel therapeutic treatments. These developments were used to inform policy and appropriate responses.

I should also, my Lady, make a brief remark about the preparations Northern Ireland had undertaken for a no-deal EU exit. Whilst these preparations did divert some of our focus away from pandemic preparedness planning, as was no doubt the case for all four nations of the United Kingdom, on the positive side the many aspects of additional training, improvements in the resilience of supply chains, and the preparedness to manage the potential consequences were, when considered overall, thought to be advantageous.

The benefits included local and regional increased buffer stocks and stockpiles for medicines and medical devices, clinical consumables and the enhanced multi-agency command and control training undertaken by all Northern Ireland departments and multi-agency responders.

These EU exit preparations also helped to finalise the building of a dedicated and bespoke departmental emergency operations centre facility, and they also served to clarify processes, roles and responsibilities for emergency responses within the department.

This also had the benefit of meaning that the department had a cohort of recently trained staff who were able to assist with the response to the Covid-19 pandemic from the outset.

While it is fair to say that no one in Northern Ireland could have reasonably anticipated the scale of the challenges caused by the pandemic, or indeed anticipated the steps necessary to prevent our health and social care system from being overwhelmed, nonetheless there are important lessons for the future.

The department is motivated to ensure that there is longer-term horizon scanning to identify future risks in tandem with actively building future capacity and capability to identify and respond to these future risks.

Undoubtedly, managing a pandemic on this scale is the most significant challenge for any government, and indeed it was particularly difficult for a newly formed Executive after three years with no government.

In considering the impact that the lack of an Executive in Northern Ireland had, in the years preceding this pandemic, we have identified several disadvantages. Despite this, and from the department's perspective, the exercise of civil contingencies and pandemic planning functions was not affected by the absence of ministers, and no policy matters arose during the three-year period that required specific consideration by the Executive.

In conclusion, my Lady, the department would reiterate that it is very aware of the far-reaching and devastating impacts that the pandemic had on all aspects of society, and is acutely conscious of the enduring consequences that continue to be experienced by our health service.

The department also recognises that the Inquiry is uniquely placed to identify learnings and recommendations that should help shape future responses. It is for these reasons that the department places the utmost importance on this Inquiry. As such, the department reiterates its firm commitment to this Inquiry and stands ready to assist in any way that it can. Given the potential for another pandemic, it is essential that lessons are identified and fully learnt across health and social care and all parts of government.

The department welcomes the opportunity to provide this opening statement and it is hoped that this brief overview of the health and social care structure, the systems and processes in Northern Ireland in relation to pandemic preparedness has been useful in setting the scene.

Finally, the department wishes again to convey our deepest sympathies to those bereaved throughout the course of the pandemic.

Those would be our submissions, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Murnaghan.

Now I think it's Mr Ford.
