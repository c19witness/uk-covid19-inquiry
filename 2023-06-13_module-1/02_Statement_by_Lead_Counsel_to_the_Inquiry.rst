2. Statement by Lead Counsel to the Inquiry
============================================

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, we will likely never know how the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, more commonly known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the Covid-19 pandemic, was first transmitted to the human race. Perhaps it came from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, China, infecting market customers and workers. Some have suggested it came from a leak of coronavirus specimens being transplanted to or stored at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

We will also likely never know when the first human infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred. Minute retrospective examination by scientists of how the genetic sequencing of the virus altered over time suggests that the dates of its emergence could have been any time between mid-October 2019 and mid-December 2019. Certainly the first reported case, reported after the event, was 12 December of 2019.

But, my Lady, for this Inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter. What we do know is that the United Kingdom, as with the rest of the world, was struck by a major pandemic.

As with all pandemics, the Covid-19 pandemic left in its wake death, misery and incalculable loss, as the impact film that we have just seen, in which we heard from just a tiny proportion of those whose loved ones had died, demonstrates so poignantly. The pandemic did not just alter fundamentally how modern societies across the globe functioned but ended in changed lives on a scale unseen in modern history.

No inquiry, however large or however long, could possibly enquire into all aspects of a pandemic that wrought such damage, and your Inquiry does not seek to do so. You have instead determined that it will focus on those areas of the pandemic and the United Kingdom's response to it that have caused the greatest public concern, and where there may be a need in the public interest to make urgent recommendations so that we may be better prepared in the event of the next national civil emergency to befall us.

That module starts today, Module 1. It commences that process. It investigates what the state of the whole country's emergency preparedness response and resilience structure and systems were when the pandemic struck in January 2020.

My Lady, I therefore need to set out the briefest of chronologies, because it's important to appreciate and understand, before we hear the evidence concerning the decade before the pandemic, what the reality was in January 2020.

So, in late December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of an unknown origin was detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. A new strain of coronavirus was subsequently isolated on 7 January 2020. It was identified as SARS-CoV-2.

On 10 January, in the United Kingdom, the Department of Health and Social Care, the DHSC, published guidance for health professionals on the assessment and management of suspected United Kingdom cases. On 21 January, the World Health Organisation published its Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Situation Report - 1. This is the date, in fact, at which the period covered by Module 1 ends.

The Situation Report - 1 recorded that, as of 20 January, 282 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV had been reported from four countries, including China, Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.

On 30 January 2020, the second meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared a public health emergency of international concern, but it's notable that they recommended no travel or trade restrictions. The virus and the disease, Covid-19, spread rapidly. The United Kingdom Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) convened for the first time on 22 January and the Civil Contingencies Committee, COBR, met on 24 January 2020. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued its first travel advice on 23 January.

The first two cases of Covid-19 in England were confirmed on 30 January, and on the same day NHS England declared a serious, level 4 incident.

By the end of January, it was becoming apparent -- and, my Lady, the degree to which it was apparent is of course a matter for Module 2 -- that the disease was a respiratory disease which was asymptomatic, meaning that a person infected by the virus may not show any symptoms of it, and for which there was no ready test, no antiviral medicine, no immunity and no vaccine.

On 15 February France recorded the first official dealt in Europe from Covid-19. By late February the number of cases outside China had increased 13-fold and the number of affected countries had tripled. A worldwide public health emergency was under way, although a pandemic was not in fact declared by the World Health Organisation until 11 March.

The first positive cases in Wales and Northern Ireland were reported on 28 February, and in Scotland on 1 March, although that case related to an outbreak that had occurred a few days earlier -- a conference that had occurred a few days earlier, on 26 and 27 February. The first death in the United Kingdom, a woman in her 70s, was confirmed on 2 March.

On 3 March, the DHSC, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, published a Coronavirus (COVID-19) action plan setting out how they planned the tackle the coronavirus outbreak.

Based on the experience of dealing with other infectious diseases and the influenza pandemic preparedness work that had been carried out, the plan stated that the United Kingdom was well prepared to respond in a way that offered substantial protection to the public.

Whether that was actually the case will be examined in Module 1.

Of course, that is why Module 1, in terms of preparedness, in terms of the response that was expected, that is the focus of your examination.

Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.

On 4 March the DHSC in England announced a campaign focusing on the importance of :outline:`washing hands`, and :outline:`washing hands for 20 seconds`, using :outline:`soap and water` or :outline:`hand sanitiser`. On 6 March the United Kingdom Government announced significant additional funding for rapid diagnostic tests and for the international fund into vaccine research.

On 11 March the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak MP, announced a package of support, including the establishment of a £5 billion emergency fund to support the NHS and other public services in England and additional NHS funding, measures for additional access to statutory sick pay, contributory employment support allowance, a hardship fund for local councils, and business interruption loans.

On 12 March, the then Prime Minister, Boris Johnson MP, announced that the United Kingdom had moved into the delay phase of the coronavirus action plan.

My Lady, you will recall that he informed the country that many more families were going to lose loved ones before their time, and he announced that, as part of the attempt to delay the spread of Covid-19, anyone with symptoms, however mild, should stay at home for at least seven days.

It is absolutely clear now, with hindsight, that the disease was spiralling out of control. But to what extent was that possibility foreseen, planned for, and guarded against? How ready were the public health structures to deal with this possibility?

The reality was that the United Kingdom government announced it would stop all community testing for Covid-19 and focus instead on testing people in hospitals and protecting health workers as it moved from the contain phase to the delay phase.

So it's clear that the system had not adequately foreseen and prepared for the need for mass testing in the event of a non-influenza pandemic.

For a flu pandemic, of course, you're most likely to show symptoms. You know you have a bug. You go home, possibly to bed, and you try not to pass it on, and tests aren't needed.

On 13 March, the then Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services, Vaughan Gething MS, announced the suspension of a number of NHS services to allow for services and beds to be reallocated and for staff to be redeployed and retrained in priority areas.

On 16 March the number of deaths in the United Kingdom rose to 55, with 1,543 confirmed cases. But the likely number of infected cases was probably over 10,000. There was no antiviral medicine and no national pandemic flu service to prescribe it, for the simple reason that Covid-19 was not an influenza virus.

The United Kingdom Government commenced daily press conferences. The Prime Minister announced anyone with a high temperature or a new and continuous cough should stay at home for 14 days, and not go out, even to buy food or essentials. The country was told to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel, to start working from home where they possibly could, and to avoid pubs, clubs, theatres, and other such social venues.

The same day, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy issued a statement calling for businesses to support it by supplying ventilators and ventilator components across the United Kingdom.

My Lady, you have directed that we ask to what extent had the system envisaged and prepared for the need for mass provision of personal protective equipment.

On 17 March the Chancellor announced £330 billion' worth of government-backed loans and £20 billion in tax cuts and grants. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised against all non-essential international travel. France imposed a nationwide lockdown. The then First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, made a statement to the Scottish Parliament setting out the stringent steps that required to be taken. The NHS England Chief Executive, then Sir Simon Stevens, and the NHS England Chief Operating Officer directed the NHS in England to take measures to redirect staff and resources to free up in-patient and critical care capacity. These included the postponement of all non-urgent elective operations, the urgent discharge of all hospital in-patients who were medically fit to leave, and the block buying of capacity in independent hospitals.

Was this need for surge capacity something that had been adequately prepared for?

On Wednesday, 18 March, the then Secretary of State for Education, Sir Gavin Williamson MP, announced the closure for the end of that week of schools other than for children of critical workers and vulnerable children. Exams and assessments were later cancelled.

The Scottish First Minister, the Welsh Minister for Education, Kirsty Williams MS, and the First and deputy First Ministers for Northern Ireland, Baroness Arlene Foster MLA and Michelle O'Neill MLA, made similar announcements.

But how developed were those plans for school closures?

On 19 March, the Department of Health and Social Care and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government provided further details of how a £5 billion support package would be given to local authorities. The Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace MP, announced that up to 20,000 MoD and service personnel would be placed on standby to support public services, including by way of driving oxygen tankers around the United Kingdom.

On Friday, 20 March, the Chancellor announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and payments of grants backdated to 1 March of up to 80% of furloughed workers' salaries.

My Lady, cafés, pubs and restaurants were requested to be closed from that night, and nightclubs, gyms, and leisure centres as soon as they reasonably could. In separate televised addresses the then First Minister of Scotland and the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford MS, made similar appeals.

At 5 pm on that Sunday, Public Health England figures showed that there were 5,683 cases of Covid in the United Kingdom, and 281 deaths. At that time, the data referred only to deaths in hospitals, and didn't even include deaths in the community, in care homes or in hospices. There had been a rise of 48 deaths since the previous day: 37 in England, seven in Wales, three in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland.

The weekly provisional figures for deaths registered in England and Wales with Covid-19 as an underlying or contributory cause calculated by the Office for National Statistics was 103 for the week ending 20 March and 539 for the week ending 27 March.

On Monday, 23 March, we will recall that the Prime Minister announced severe restrictions on the entirety of the United Kingdom in what became known as the first national lockdown.

On 24 March, the Senedd, the Welsh Parliament, agreed to a legislative consent motion on the Coronavirus Bill.

On 25 March, the Coronavirus Act was passed by the United Kingdom Parliament and received royal assent. It had passed through all the stages in the House of Commons procedure in a single day.

Then on 26 March, the lockdown regulations were introduced. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations were introduced by way of a statutory instrument made by the Secretary of State, Matt Hancock, Member of Parliament, using emergency powers available to him under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, and the regulations came into effect the moment that they were made, at 1 pm on the same day.

Analogous coronavirus restrictions regulations were made in Scotland and Wales by the Scottish Ministers and the Welsh Ministers.

On 28 March Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations were also made by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.

I mention, my Lady, the various regulatory structures because one of the workstreams that had been progressed in the years leading up to the pandemic was one of working on a pandemic Bill, a draft pandemic Bill, to cover for the eventuality of a pandemic striking the United Kingdom. But in reality, the lockdown regulations that were made in England were made under a 1984 Act, the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act, Scotland under the Coronavirus Act, and in Northern Ireland under a 1967 piece of legislation.

That day, 26 March, the daily death toll went up by 115. The pandemic had the country in its grip.

Almost every area of public life across all four nations, including education, work, travel, the majority of public services and family life were adversely affected. The hospitality, retail, travel and tourism, arts and culture and the sport and leisure sectors effectively ceased, even places of worship closed.

My Lady, as you know, for very many, what they had to deal with went far beyond the curtailment of their normal lives and involved bereavement, serious illness, deprivation, mental illness, exposure to violence at home, terrible financial loss, loneliness, and many other forms of suffering.

Health and social care workers, the police and the emergency services, transport workers, teachers, and other key workers continued, however, in their places of work and they put their own lives on the line in terms of their safety.

The months and years that followed, we all recall, saw death and illness on an unprecedented scale, but I don't need to set out, even in outline, the events that followed. The lifting of the first lockdown, the further lockdowns, the local restrictions, the gradual differences of approach between the United Kingdom and the devolved administrations, and finally the route out of the pandemic afforded by the gift of vaccines.

That is because, for the purposes of this module, the state of preparedness must be measured against the reality of when the pandemic first struck, January 2020.

It's my solemn duty to record that government figures state that up to 12 May 2023 in England there have been 192,231 deaths where Covid-19 was recorded on the death certificate. In Scotland, the figure is 17,603. In Wales, it is 11,848. And in Northern Ireland, 5,295, making a total across the United Kingdom of 226,977 lives.

My Lady, by the measure of excess deaths or excess mortality, that is to say the number of deaths from all causes over and above what would be expected under normal conditions, had the pandemic not occurred, so capturing not only confirmed deaths but also Covid-19 deaths that were not correctly diagnosed or reported, as well as other causes that are attributable to the pandemic, the figures are likely to be higher still.

Research reveals that mortality rates were significantly higher among people with pre-existing conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.

Shockingly, mortality was 2.6 times higher in the most deprived than the least deprived tenth of areas. People from some ethnic minority groups had a significantly higher risk of being infected by Covid-19 and also of dying from it.

Covid-19 mortality during the pandemic was highest in people from the Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Black Caribbean communities, and mortality rates were higher among people with a self-reported disability or a learning disability.

So the big question for Module 1 is to what extent were those terrible outcomes either foreseen or capable of mitigation?

My Lady, the pandemic has had profound financial and economic consequences. It's put National Health systems under enormous and continuing pressure. The impact on the healthcare systems, its operations, its waiting lists and on elective care has been immense. Millions of patients have either not sought or received treatment and the backlog has now reached historic levels.

Jobs and businesses have been destroyed, and livelihoods were taken away. The pandemic disrupted the education of children and young people, put children at risk, and has left us with an enduring concern that the pandemic furthered disparities in attainment and development.

The pandemic impacted the most disadvantaged communities in society all the more, both in terms of the consequences of getting the virus and in terms of the steps taken to combat the virus. Societal damage in terms of the exacerbation of inequalities and the denial of access to opportunity has been widespread. Its impact will be felt for decades to come.

My Lady, the emergence of this natural disaster could not have been avoided. But the key issue is whether that impact that I have described was inevitable. Were those terrible consequences inexorable or were they avoidable or capable of mitigation?

The starting point for your Inquiry is that whilst we may not know the moment that this virus came into existence, or how exactly it made its way into the human race, we do know that the possibility of a pandemic had been foretold and thought about. Indeed, it had long been assessed by planners that there was a significant risk of a non-influenza pandemic and an even greater risk of a flu pandemic.

Such risks were assessed and thought about, and planned for, and prepared for, and written about by the departments, bodies, agencies, services, responders and personnel who make up the United Kingdom's emergency preparedness, resilience and response structures, the EPRR structure, the first major acronym to which it's my unhappy duty to refer in an area infested by acronyms.

But fundamentally, in relation to significant aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic, we were taken by surprise. Huge, urgent and complex policy decisions were required to be taken in relation to shielding, employment support, managing disruption to schools, borders, lockdowns, and non-pharmaceutical interventions, restrictions, social restrictions, and, equally importantly, the profoundly unequal impact of the pandemic on the vulnerable and the marginalised.

Few of those areas were anticipated, let alone considered in detail.

My Lady, no amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be. No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared, and so it is to the adequacy and sufficiency of those structures, the plans, the steps taken to prepare, and the degree to which the country was resilient, that is to say able to respond and bounce back, that this first phase of the Covid-19 Inquiry turns its attention.

Module 1 will ask: were the right EPRR structures in place, the right procedures, the right plans? Was the system of central devolved regional and local government response available and ready to go? Did civil contingency planners think carefully enough about the risks of a pandemic and how they could best prepare for the crises which might develop from those risks?

Module 1 will look at whether the EPRR system was effective and practical, that the bodies and structures that populate it were fit for purpose and not duplicative or obsolete.

We will ask whether the system was designed to work well under pressure, whether it gave responders, nationally and locally, the proper tools to respond with. We want to know whether the policy documents and planning guidance were useful, and not tarnished with bureaucracy or prescriptive overmanagement or jargon.

Most of the evidence over the next six weeks will be concerned with those issues.

My Lady, standing back, there can, however, be no proper scrutiny of the pandemic planning -- with which of course you are primarily concerned -- without a simultaneous detailed examination of the actual civil emergency structures upon which pandemic planning rests, because pandemic planning is, of course, just a feature of the wider civil emergency structure.

So, my Lady, the Inquiry will be looking at whether, as a nation, we were sufficiently resilient. Resilience is related to capacity and concerns the ability of a country to resist, absorb and recover from shock.

The ability to recover is closely connected to the general health and wealth of the country as a whole. It is for this reason that part of the module, as well as later modules in your Inquiry which will focus specifically on inequalities, will explore what state the nation was in as we entered the pandemic. Did the high levels of heart disease, diabetes, respiratory illness and obesity renders us more vulnerable? Had there been a slowdown in health improvement in the decade before? Had health inequalities widened? Did emergency planning sufficiently account for pre-existing health and societal inequalities, deprivation, structural racism, and other forms of discrimination which undoubtedly exist in society?

As for wealth, it is self-evident that the capacity of any country's public health care and social care systems to be able to cope with a pandemic is constrained by funding, and therefore you need to enquire how well funded were the United Kingdom's health structures. To what degree have our public services, especially those of health and social care, suffered from underinvestment? How well resourced were the United Kingdom's public health structures?

My Lady, these questions must be asked. This is not because it lies in the power of your Inquiry to resolve them. The Inquiry plainly cannot of itself bring about general improvements in health, social care or public services, let alone direct that they be made.

The questions must be asked because I have no doubt that if you conclude that, as a country, we were insufficiently resilient and that, in future, different political and financial choices may have to be made in order to render us better able to withstand a system shock, you will want to say so.

But the need for all these questions is obvious. First, the bereaved and those who otherwise suffered, of whom there are very many in number, are entitled to know if anything could have been done to prevent their loss or reduce their suffering.

Second, if we were shocked by the outbreak of Covid-19, history suggests we should not have been. Epidemics, that is to say the occurrence of a disease in a population at a level that is significantly above the baseline level, occur frequently. They can come on extraordinarily rapidly and spread very quickly. They kill large numbers of people.

Pandemics, whilst rarer, are not new. Ever since humans have walked on this earth, pandemic disease -- the Black Death, plague, cholera, typhoid, yellow fever, influenza and Ebola -- has walked with us, and scientists are clear that there is an ever-increasing risk of pandemics in the future.

Diseases from animals, zoonotic diseases, pose a perpetual threat. A large proportion of those viruses which infect mammals are capable of infecting humans, and many of them have been associated with human deaths. At the same time, diseases are becoming more prevalent and are being spread wider and faster on account of globalisation and urbanisation.

So it's vital that international surveillance and alert systems work effectively.

Furthermore, terrible though it is to acknowledge, the rate in the United Kingdom at which Covid-19 generally killed those persons who were confirmed to have been infected with it, the case fatality rate, was relatively low, around 1%. The 1918 H1N1 flu pandemic was worse. Its case fatality rate was around 2.5% to 6% and it caused a massive number of deaths worldwide. The estimates of death ranged in that pandemic from 17.5 million to 100 million.

The case fatality rates of other diseases, such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Ebola and smallpox were also much higher than SARS-CoV-2. Significantly, the case fatality rate of MERS, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, the disease from camels that erupted in 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, was about 34.3%. SARS -- severe acute respiratory syndrome -- CoV-1, the earlier coronavirus pandemic in 2002, was around 9.6%.

The relatively mild swine flu in 2009-10, about which we'll hear a considerable amount of evidence in due course, was less than 0.01%.

What is critical, therefore, is transmissibility. The more infectious the disease, the more people are infected and the greater number of people that will die. So the disease which poses the greatest risk to human life is the one that is both highly infectious or transmissible and, once transmitted, severe or deadly.

At the moment there are two notable subtypes of avian influenza or bird flu that are prevalent. Both have extremely high case fatality rates. Fortuitously they haven't yet sustained human to human transmission. Let us hope they never do. But the possibility cannot be ruled out, which of course adds an even greater impetus for the need to ensure that our systems of preparedness are ready.

My Lady, the module is ambitious in terms of its scope. The documentary material which it encompasses is vast. But there is a limit, and I need to make plain what those limits are.

First, Module 1 is not an inquiry into all aspects of the United Kingdom's emergency planning systems. It's only an inquiry into those parts of the general structures as is necessary to enable you to answer the questions: were the structures and systems ready for the pandemic that struck and how can we make them better ready for next time?

Secondly, Module 1 has a timeframe, and I've already referred to the second date, the end date, 21 January 2020, when the Situation Report - 1 was issued by the World Health Organisation. It is beyond the ability of your Inquiry to go back before June 2009, which was when the World Health Organisation announced that scientific criteria for an influenza pandemic had been met for what became known as the 2009 swine flu pandemic.

A third important point is that the Inquiry needs to be aware of the difference between structure, central government departments, regional government, devolved administrations and the like; policy, which is government departments and bodies setting out rules as to how they'll go about deciding what to do; the planning, what is everyone meant to do; and finally, operational response, how services and help are actually provided.

They are all important, but operational response is not a matter for Module 1. Equally, issues such as the core political and administrative decision-making, the merits and the timings of national lockdowns, vaccines, the specifics of healthcare, the response of the care sector, the detail of Test and Trace, PPE procurement, financial assistance, the government's response, and the impact of the pandemic on various sectors of the country, particularly including the vulnerable, are for later modules. The more detailed explanation of the way in which the country responded has to await those later modules.

May I now then turn to the system for preparedness.

It is obvious, my Lady, that the degree to which Covid-19 could be prevented from laying waste to society was a matter within the control of government and the systems for EPRR which existed. Those systems may not be able to stop a pandemic in its tracks, but they ought to be able to put in place measures of understanding a virus, understanding and forecasting how it might develop, tracking it, limiting transmission and coping with the consequences of large scale transmission.

In order to see what worked well and what faltered or failed, I'm afraid it's necessary to have a basic level of understanding of how the systems were set up. Many following this opening statement may have some appreciation of the terms and of the bodies of the structures, but for those who do not, it's necessary to set out some short definitions and explanations which will assist in their understanding of the evidence which you will shortly hear.

My Lady, it is a particularly complicated system. To help us guide listeners through it, could we have, please, on the screen, a document prepared by the Inquiry, INQ000204014.

My Lady, this is a document which the Inquiry team have prepared which sets out the basic structures concerning EPRR for the United Kingdom and England and also for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The INQ number is just a reference to the Inquiry's electronic document system. I should say that this is a document which is evolving. We will improve it as we go along in light of helpful comments from the core participants and the various government and devolved administrations of the United Kingdom.

Could we go forward, please, to page 4. That, my Lady, is a schematic representation of the United Kingdom and England's emergency preparedness, resilience and response system.

Starting from the top, the Cabinet Office, of whom of course we've heard much in recent days, is the government department in the United Kingdom responsible for supporting the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. It is composed of various units that support Cabinet Committees and which co-ordinate the delivery of government objectives, but primarily working with other government departments.

One of its most important functions is national security and the co-ordination of the United Kingdom Government's response to crises.

My Lady, it's obvious that in an emergency the Cabinet Office needs to draw on the expertise of other government departments in its emergency planning, and so there is something called the lead government department.

In relation to a pandemic, it's obvious that the lead government department would be the Department of Health and Social Security, and we can see in the middle of the screen -- and I emphasise just for convenience sake we are focusing on the United Kingdom and England in this schematic design rather than looking at Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, for which there are, equally, schematic designs of no less importance.

So the blue part in the middle of the picture represents the Department for Health and Social Care. Lead government departments are the government departments which are appointed to deal and lead on issues which affect them most.

So, my Lady, one of the questions which you will be addressing is whether or not this lead government department model is the correct one for a whole system civil emergency or do the requirements of this acute type of crisis require a different approach? If so, what approach should that be?

It is self-evident that in a crisis of the magnitude of the Covid-19 pandemic, the burden could not solely be carried by the lead government department, because of course the pandemic affected every part of the government and of British public life, from education to the care sector, of course, to the Treasury, to our finances, our jobs and livelihoods.

The Department for Health and Social Care oversees the National Health Service in England. It oversees the United Kingdom's arm's length bodies, such as the United Kingdom Health Security Agency. So a primary question going into the pandemic was: was the Department of Health and Social Care adequately prepared? Did it identify with sufficient adequacy the surge capacity in terms of hospital infrastructure, clinicians and support workers that would be required?

During the Module 1 timeframe, the Civil Contingencies Secretariat was the Cabinet Office unit that managed both the United Kingdom Government's preparedness for and its response to major nationwide emergencies. My Lady, it was established in 2001, and in July 2022, after the pandemic, was split into two separate functions, focusing on its emergency response functions, the COBR unit, about which we'll hear a great deal more, and resilience frameworks called the Resilience Directorate, and -- thank you very much -- the Civil Contingencies Secretariat has been highlighted at the top of the screen.

Towards the top right of the screen, you will see a reference to the National Security Risk Assessment.

The National Security Risk Assessment is the United Kingdom Government's classified assessment of the top national level risks facing the United Kingdom. The assessment focuses on both the likelihood of the risk occurring and the impact it would have were it to happen. And it has a public-facing document, the National Risk Register, which provides information for those who have contingency planning responsibilities at a national, regional and local level.

My Lady, we know, of course, what the broad nature of future emergencies might be. Natural hazards include global health challenges, animal and plant diseases, growing antimicrobial resistance, space weather events, extreme weather, climate change, infrastructure collapse, or perhaps the unintended consequence of human endeavour in artificial intelligence. The world is an uncertain place and risks seem set only to grow.

Though the exact nature of those major risks cannot, of course, be identified in advance, and because it's not possible to know in advance with certainty which risks will crystallise, and how, and because it's not practical to plan for every major risk, there will always be uncertainty.

So the government draws up policies, and those policies are, by their nature, of more general application. But both the policies and the planned operational responses must build in the ability to respond to the unknown and provide for contingencies. Government planning must be flexible.

Were the governments of the four countries flexible enough with their policy making? Was the consideration of what those risks might be and how they could be prepared for sufficiently imaginative?

My Lady, you will hear evidence that for many years an influenza pandemic was assessed as being one of the most likely risks to the United Kingdom. But what about other risks that, whilst they might be less likely, could be just as, if not more, deadly? Did planning sufficiently address the risk not only of the known but the unknown, a new pathogen, a new disease, a disease X, as it's known, with pandemic potential?

Did planners pay sufficient focus on potential impact as opposed to likelihood?

With Covid, the evidence will demonstrate that the government thought that the greater risk was an influenza pandemic and, therefore, devoted more time and resources to that possibility. In the event, we were hit, of course, by a coronavirus. That might suggest a lack of flexibility or proper foresight. Or perhaps the policies, plans and structures were so flexible and broad, so as to a cover any reasonable possibility, that this prevented us from focusing enough on those particular risks which, as I say, whilst being perhaps less likely, could cause us more harm.

So a core question in Module 1 will be: to what extent was thought given to and planning devoted to the risk of a new emerging infectious disease that was not influenza? Did the system of planning become self-validating or complacent so that that question was not asked, or if it was asked by individuals was not listened to?

To what extent were the likely consequences of either influenza or a new and emerging infectious disease reassessed?

My Lady, the evidence may show that there was a degree of assumption in the process, that if there was to be an influenza pandemic, it would be bound to lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths. This was because planners positively planned on what was known as the reasonable worst case scenario, the RWCS, planning for the worst case that could realistically happen.

The good sense of planning for the worst case that could realistically happen is obvious: you need to prepare everyone to respond to that possibility, to have enough resources, enough surge capacity, enough room for manoeuvre in the healthcare and social care systems, enough PPE and so on. But not at the expense of pausing and asking: what more can we do to ensure we don't get to that stage at all?

The evidence may show, simply and terribly, that not enough people thought to ask, because everybody started to assume it would be flu. And if it was flu, diagnostic testing, case detection and isolation are less effective on account of the shorter incubation period, and, as I've said, there would always be antiviral medicine and vaccines and a national pandemic flu service.

So, my Lady, to what extent did the UK Government and the devolved administrations have a strategy for preventing a pandemic from having disastrous effects, as opposed to dealing with the disastrous effects of the pandemic and the reasonable worst case scenario which was assumed to follow?

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Keith, I have been encouraged to take regular breaks, as you know, for the purposes of the stenographer and others. Would that be a convenient moment? I apologise for interrupting.

**Mr Keith**: It's a very convenient moment.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you. I shall be back at 11.30.

*(11.15 am)*

*(A short break)*

*(11.32 am)*

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, Mr Keith.

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, I was addressing you in relation to whether or not the United Kingdom Government and the devolved administrations had a strategy at all for preventing a pandemic from having disastrous effects, as opposed to dealing with the disastrous effects of the pandemic.

Part of the answer may lie in the doctrinal thinking that underpins the emergency preparedness, resilience and response system. So the United Kingdom Government and the devolved administrations adopted what is known as the integrated emergency management structure, and it had six phases: anticipate, assess, prevent, prepare, respond and recover. And this concept underpinned both the approach to emergency preparedness, resilience and response and the revised law and legal arrangements which were introduced into this area in the early 2000s.

So one of the issues for you in this module will be whether or not this was the right approach for the United Kingdom and the devolved administrations. Did this approach, under the integrated emergency management structure, have the right emphasis? Were these stages the right ones? So, for example, although I've made a reference to prevent and prepare, did this doctrinal approach sufficiently ensure that the government thought about how to stop the terrible consequences that it was planning for appearing in the first place?

Furthermore, doctrinally, was there sufficient independent and rigorous expert advice? Was that expert advice in the government system sufficient in its range and diversity? Did the government learn sufficiently from the experiences of other countries, especially those such as Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, who had learned from the SARS-1 and the MERS epidemics, to which I made reference earlier, and whose preparations were in fact more advanced in some ways than our own?

Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that will be forever seared into the national consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.

Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, something as complex and difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all. Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and the economy of trying to control a runaway virus in this way.

Was there an element of complacency based on our recent experiences, including the ranking in the Global Health Security Index, our response to swine flu in 2009 and the United Kingdom's undoubted successes in ensuring that SARS and MERS did not spread? Did our experience of the 2009 swine flu lead to concerns about overreacting?

My Lady, there had been numerous exercises, but to what extent were those exercises adequate in terms of scope and frequency, and the persons who were invited to participate in them? What was learnt from those exercises? What lessons were taken away from them in relation to future risks and future preparedness?

At a more fundamental level, therefore, should there be an EPRR agency, an independent agency, to take complete control of national planning, preparedness and resilience? Such an agency might be responsible for managing the structure, with the assistance of the rest of government, checking it and testing it. It could provide advice to the government and the devolved administrations on long-term strategy. It could commission external expertise from the fields of technology, health, economics and the military. Perhaps there should be a central leadership position accountable to Parliament with responsibility for whole system preparedness, resilience and response.

My Lady, I mentioned a few moments ago the legal structures which were introduced in the 2000s. One of the most important legal reforms based around this doctrinal approach to which I've made reference was the introduction of the Civil Contingencies Act in 2004.

It provided the framework for civil protection in the United Kingdom and it identifies and establishes a set of roles and responsibilities for those involved in EPRR at a local level and allows for the making of emergency regulations to help deal with the most serious of emergencies.

If we could have, please, the document, the chart up, INQ000204104-0004, please, at page 4.

Thank you.

You will see in the bottom left-hand corner of this chart, which is again the United Kingdom and England one, around about August 2019, a reference in the very bottom left-hand corner to local category 1 responders and local category 2 responders.

So part 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 provided for two groups of responders to an emergency: category 1 responders, namely the police and the emergency services, local authorities and the healthcare system, the NHS; and category 2 responders, utility and transport providers, water companies, Health and Safety Executive and communication providers.

Now, those category 1 responders are subject to the full set of civil protection duties. They're required to assess the risk of emergencies occurring and use this to inform contingency planning locally. They put in place the actual emergency plans upon which reliance is based in the event of a crisis. They put in place business continuity management arrangements. They make information available to the public, and they share information with other local responders to enhance co-ordination.

The category 2 organisations, by contrast, the co-operating bodies, are less likely to be involved in planning work, but they will be heavily involved in incidents that involve their own sector. They have a lesser set of duties, they're obliged to co-operate and share information, but they don't and they are not obliged to react in the same ways as the category 1 organisations.

But there are no comparable duties on central government. The only legal duties are on those category 1 and category 2 responders.

So in the event of a national crisis which engages the whole of government, is there a case for the imposition of legal duties on central government as well?

Across England, local resilience forums support the planning between all those various bodies. They consist of the category 1 and category 2 responders and they are the bodies which plan, which prepare for the crises or emergencies which might befall the locality.

If we look again at the bottom of the page, in the bottom left-hand corner, we can see local resilience forums, the bodies into which the local category 1 responders and category 2 responders report. My Lady, there may be some degree of surprise that in this important system of emergency response and preparation the bodies who are primarily concerned with planning for emergencies, and indeed responding to emergencies, appear to be right down at the bottom left-hand side of the page, and to be local. And the reason for that is that the United Kingdom system works on the basis of subsidiarity. That principle is designed to ensure that those with local knowledge make the decisions on the ground. They are the people who will know the area well and therefore can best respond to flooding or some crisis or emergency which envelops a town or a part of a town or part of the countryside, or the region.

But those local resilience forums are, if you like, at one end, therefore, of these lines of communication. Is that the best model? Are local resilience forums and their devolved equivalents adequately resourced, accountable and led? To what extent did the central government, when we were hit by the pandemic, deal with the local resilience forums, ensure that they had what they needed to be able to respond?

In this system, there is a further conundrum, which is that local resilience forums deal with planning, but response, when an emergency strikes, is actually in the hands of a different group, called the strategic co-ordination groups. I think we should have that in yellow just above "Local Resilience Forums", if that could be highlighted, we can see "Strategic co-ordination groups".

These are different bodies, but largely composed of the same bodies that make up the LRF, the local resilience forum, and they focus on the actual response to an emergency. Is there an unnecessary degree of duplication here?

Another important area concerns the Resilience Emergencies Division, halfway up the page on the left. That is the division which rests within the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, now in fact the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and it provides advice to the local resilience forums through its resilience advisers, which we can see a little bit further down the left-hand side of the page.

So, in essence, the Resilience and Emergencies Division is the liaison with the national and local tiers of response.

So we have already, therefore, an understanding that in this system you have the Cabinet Office, you have the lead government department, you have other government departments, and you have the Resilience and Emergency Division of the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, all concerned with ensuring that the system works.

Is that really the best way of doing it?

No less important, as I've earlier said, are the devolved administrations. Preparedness and resilience are devolved matters, meaning that they are the responsibility of each devolved administration and not of Westminster, and this Inquiry is looking, of course, at the states of preparedness and resilience in all the countries.

But on the subject of devolution, an important issue therefore immediately arises: has the devolution settlement which has made preparedness and resilience a devolved matter struck the correct balance between the leadership, which is obviously necessary in any whole country civil emergency, whole nation, whole United Kingdom emergency, and the benefits of a tailored, localised response?

So if we could, please, then look briefly at page 6 in this INQ document, and then go forward -- yes, thank you -- we will see at the top of the page, "Pandemic preparedness and response structures Scotland ... 2019", and because, as I've said, resilience and preparedness are devolved issues, if we could please zoom back out -- thank you -- and see the whole page, you will see, of course, that the vast majority of the bodies in Scotland dealing with preparedness and resilience are Scottish bodies.

But the link to the United Kingdom comes from the Cabinet Office, which sits on top of the whole structure, which is why the Cabinet Office is at the top of the chart, and linked through COBR, the Civil Contingencies Secretariat to which I've made reference, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, down to the devolved administration level.

Page 10, please. The analogous scheme for Wales, broadly speaking, in 2019. Again, you can see that all the bodies in the bottom two-thirds of the page are devolved bodies, and again the link to the United Kingdom comes through the Cabinet Office at the top.

Page 14, similarly in relation to Northern Ireland.

So, my Lady, you will see from those pages and those schemes that there are a number of important bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which carry out analogous functions to those in Westminster and England.

In Scotland -- I won't take you to them -- the Scottish Resilience Partnership. There are regional resilience partnerships. In Scotland, each regional resilience partnership has its own local resilience partnership. There are then a number of ministerial bodies for government resilience. There are government resilience officials, and emergency arrangements were arranged through the Scottish Government resilience room.

In Wales we have the Wales Resilience Forum, the Joint Emergency Services Group, local resilience forums.

In Northern Ireland, the Civil Contingencies Group, emergency response groups and strategic co-ordination groups.

My Lady, there are a profusion of bodies.

In relation to Northern Ireland, a vital issue is the impact in January -- or what was the impact in January 2020 on preparedness, response and resilience arrangements of the prior collapse in power sharing.

My Lady, as is well known, the Good Friday Agreement, or Belfast Agreement, which was signed in April 1998, provided for a new devolved system of government with an Assembly and Executive at Stormont. However, thereafter power sharing, as you know, was suspended a number of times. Most relevantly it was suspended between January 2017, when the then Sinn Féin deputy First Minister, the late Martin McGuinness, resigned, and remained suspended until Saturday, 11 January 2020, just as the pandemic was starting to spread to the province.

During that time Northern Ireland was managed by civil servants without ministerial oversight. We will therefore be exploring to what extent that lack of ministerial input affected the civil emergency arrangements and, in particular, the inability, because of the collapse of the power sharing agreement, to make any significant improvements to this structure during that interregnum.

Those with sharp eyes will see that each of the four nations has its own public health body: Public Health Wales, there is a Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland, and Public Health Scotland; in England, the Health Protection Agency was established in 2003. In April 2013, Public Health England was established incorporating the Health Protection Agency alongside public health functions previously carried out by the Department of Health and regional health authorities.

Thereafter, and it's not on the scheme because the scheme represents the position in 2020 -- or 2019, rather. In April 2021 the UK Health Security authority was established, which took on parts of Public Health England, focusing on health protection, alongside the functions of NHS Test and Trace and the Joint Biosecurity Centre. But the Public Health England's health improvement functions were transferred to the Department of Health and Social Care.

My Lady, another issue, therefore, for Module 1: why did those structural changes occur? Why did they occur when they did? Were they an improvement, particularly the abolition of Public Health England and the bifurcation of public health protection from public health improvement?

What was the state of pandemic readiness and preparedness for each of those bodies?

There had also been significant reforms to the national and local systems for public health. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 transferred most public health functions from NHS bodies in England and Wales to local authorities. At the same time, local authorities with public health responsibilities were required to employ a specialist director of public health. Were directors of public health utilised effectively within their local authorities? Did those public health reforms make our public health structures more or less resilient and able to respond to a pandemic?

My Lady, all these bodies and entities have to be run, managed and paid for. They have to be supervised and told what to do. Drafting has to be done of a myriad number of policy documents and guidance. They have to be assured, which is just another word for being tested or checked. Who provided oversight as to that state of preparedness of local responders, arm's length bodies, lead government departments, other government departments? And all those processes had to be provided for, discussed, agreed, and put into place.

We've seen, my Lady, in the written evidence that relevant bodies, committees and subcommittees within government were renamed or sometimes disbanded altogether only for other strikingly similar ones to be set up in the immediate aftermath.

One might conclude, looking at the schematic schedules, that there was a labyrinthine and confusing picture. Was it really necessary?

Were there proper links between central government and local authority, not just tick box consultation? Were there proper communications between central government and the devolved administrations that were not just dependent on the political will of ministers?

So, my Lady, standing back, was this civil emergencies system as good as it could be? Were these structures adequate or was their proliferation a hindrance to the United Kingdom's response? What can you do to make this better?

Turning, finally, to the end product of all this, how to put actual plans in place so that everybody knows actually what to do in the event of an emergency, how were those plans drawn up, checked and compared? Was there adequate testing of plans for an actual pandemic? Were the structures in place for ensuring that plans for the necessary surge in healthcare and social care provision were there, for stockpiling and distribution of PPE and mass diagnostic testing?

Of course those areas are only concerned with the health consequences of a pandemic, but a pandemic is prone to affect, as I've said, every area of public life. So where were the plans and how adequate were they for the shielding, employment support, disruption to schools, border policy, lockdowns and, as I've said, the profoundly unequal impact of a pandemic on the vulnerable and marginalised?

Lastly, the pandemic struck the United Kingdom just as it was leaving the European Union. That departure required an enormous amount of planning and preparation, particularly to address what were likely to be the severe consequences of a no-deal exit on food and medicine supplies, travel and transport, business, borders and so on. It is clear that such planning, from 2018 onwards, crowded out and prevented some or perhaps a majority of the improvements that central government itself understood were required to be made to resilience planning and preparedness.

Did the attention therefore paid to the risks of a no-deal exit, Operation Yellowhammer as it was known, drain the resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic, that should have been utilised in preparing the United Kingdom for civil emergency?

Or did all that generic and operational planning in fact lead to people being better trained and well marshalled and, in fact, better prepared to deal with Covid, and also to the existence of improved trade medicine and supply links?

My Lady, on the evidence so far, but it will be a matter for you, we very much fear that it was the former.

One of the most important features of Module 1 will be to consider whether health inequalities were appropriately considered in the planning for a pandemic, and I leave this issue to last in reflection of the fact that it is an issue which will find its reflection through the entirety of the evidence which you have directed be called in Module 1.

The Inquiry will look at how the lives of different types of people with different experiences were regarded by those with a duty of protecting them. For each of the decision-makers, the civil servants and those tasked with the responsibility of preparing our systems, were social and clinical vulnerabilities considered by them at all? When the emergency plans were drawn up, did they have regard to the social inequalities and health inequalities which would undoubtedly be exacerbated by the outcome of that planning? The evidence will reveal the reality to that question.

So, my Lady, there is a great deal to cover. I think I have said quite enough. You will hear now opening statements from counsel representing the Module 1 core participants, and then we will turn to the evidence of the witnesses whom Kate Blackwell King's Counsel and I will then examine.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Keith.

Mr Weatherby.
