9. Submissions on Behalf of Frontline Migrant Health Workers Group by Mr Marquis
================================================================================

**Mr Marquis**: It was once.

Thank you very much, my Lady. Along with Katharine Newton KC, I represent the Frontline Migrant Health Workers Group, we are instructed by the Public Interest Law Centre.

I propose to summarise our written submissions, to give an overview of the group's work in the care sector and then make some submissions on scope that follow on from their experience.

First of all, the group would like to thank the Inquiry for including them in this module, but also for the particular inclusion of home care within the module's scope.

The group is a collective of two trade unions, the United Voices of the World and the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, and a community consortium, Kanlungan. Kanlungan is a charitable organisation consisting of several Filipino and Southeast Asian community groups. They work for the welfare and interests of migrants, refugees and diaspora communities from South East Asia in the UK. Their members work across the care sector, including nurses, non-clinical staff and home carers.

IWGB and UVW are non-TUC-affiliated trade unions with membership in several sectors, including the social care sector. Their members works as care workers, cleaners and kitchen staff, often in outsourced gig economy positions. Group members are overwhelmingly working class, in low paid and precarious employment.

The majority are women and migrant and/or ethnic minority workers. As such they fall within the protected characteristics of the Equality Act.

However, the group wishes to emphasise at the outset that systemic issues such as outsourced employment are applicable across the working class, regardless of ethnicity and gender.

Most members work outside the NHS and local authority care homes in the privatised care sector. Many work in the informal care sector, in private homes. In the first months of the pandemic, as government tried to free up capacity, hospitals were forced to discharge patients into the care sector. The government's policies ensured that patients were discharged without testing or isolation into care homes that were populated by the clinically vulnerable and staffed by the most disadvantaged of workers.

An underfunded NHS was effectively told to shunt the problem elsewhere. Care workers were placed under immense pressure to meet the needs that the healthcare system could not meet.

Pre-pandemic, 61% of care sector workers were employed by private providers, with just 7% by local authorities and 6% by the NHS. The average public sector pay was around £10 an hour, the average private sector pay was around £8.40, which is below the living wage. There is a heavy reliance on outsourced workers, particularly in the private sector, where a full third of social care jobs were classified as insecure. Home care workers, that figure was 56%, on zero-hours contracts.

Almost a quarter of the national care sector workforce are from ethnic minority backgrounds, rising to 70% in London, and 82% nationally of social care workers are women.

It cannot have come as a surprise to anyone that in May 2020 the ONS were reporting that care workers were among the occupations at the highest risk of death. Historically, the main social determinant of health inequality is income: the poorer you are, the more precarious your employment, the more exposed you are and the more likely you are to die.

Care sector workers are some of the lowest paid workers in the country, even when they have the benefit of an employment contract. Outsourced workers, without the contractual protection needed to demand safer conditions from their employers, were at even greater risk.

Migrant care workers were all the more vulnerable. When immigration status is tied to employment, you cannot refuse unreasonable demands from employers without losing both your job and your home.

Migrant workers who were undocumented had no protection at all.

In care homes, the two major pandemic issues were understaffing and PPE. Understaffing was chronic pre-pandemic, and evidently a lack of sufficient staff leads to unsafe workplaces, and this was inevitably exacerbated when the virus ripped through the care sector.

A key feature of the gig economy is that workers had to work in multiple care homes, filling gaps caused by understaffing and sickness. The very nature of their employment made them vectors of the virus.

The causes of understaffing are multifaceted. Low pay and insecure employment are plainly major considerations. Outsourced workers in the private sector often put pre-Covid understaffing down to profit margins. As one member put it, it's about profit rather than proper care.

Whatever the reasons, an understaffed sector cannot be resilient to a pandemic. The government's post-pandemic response to understaffing was to issue employment-linked visas to 70,000 overseas workers in 2023, in effect outsourcing the problem internationally and subsidising the cost of care in the UK through low wages.

This doesn't address the problem and, in the context of the government's hostile environment policies, it creates precisely the subclass of worker that group members have reported. And some examples: migrant workers being disproportionately allocated to higher risk environments, unable to object because of their immigration status being dependent on --

**Lady Hallett**: I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr Marquis, but I've got to be really careful in what I'm addressing. I have terms of reference -- I cannot change the whole of society. My terms of reference relate to the pandemic and the response -- the preparedness for, which we've done in Module 1 to a large extent, and response to. I'm afraid you are, I'm afraid, trespassing on areas where I cannot go. The other area I cannot go are party politics. So if you could please just focus on the issues that I'm addressing this module, I would be extremely grateful.

**Mr Marquis**: My Lady, these workers that I'm just referring to were disproportionately allocated to higher risk environments, and there --

**Lady Hallett**: That I understand, but if you could make sure it is related to the care sector and the pandemic. Some of your remarks sounded a bit more general. Maybe I misunderstood, I'm sorry if I did.

**Mr Marquis**: I'm trying to set the scene, my Lady. But I'll continue and I'll endeavour to stay as close to the scope as possible.

Workers in the care sector who had "no recourse to public funds" conditions applied to their visas found themselves destitute in the event of sickness and fearful of seeking medical treatment, including testing and vaccination, due to the risk of medical charges and immigration consequences.

Sick workers with work-dependent immigration statuses were often pressured to return to work in order to cover staff shortages.

On PPE, group members report a total lack of PPE in care homes at the outset of the pandemic, leaving them unprotected when hospital patients were discharged into their care. A single example: at a nursing home in North London, UVW workers took to :outline:`making their own masks` by laminating pieces of plastic and fixing them around their heads with elastic sourced from their leggings. When employed staff were provided with PPE, outsourced staff were often forced to work without the same protection. When PPE was provided, it was frequently in the face of employer intransigence, often of a lower standard, ill fitting and provided without guidance on use.

There are frequent examples, which I've put within our written submissions, of care staff raising concerns about mismanagement that in part came about as a result of infrastructure issues and in part came about as a result of accountability issues.

We also have examples of outsourced workers reporting employers refusing to pay sick pay. The inadequacy of statutory sick pay led to sick workers facing destitution or, in some cases, facing no option but to continue to work even whilst they were ill.

Home care workers make up a large cohort of Kanlungan's members. Many have employment-dependent immigration status. A large proportion have irregular immigration status and are informally employed without contracts. Their roles often involve giving complex care to vulnerable people.

During the pandemic, home care workers were overexposed through a lack of PPE but also through an expectation to continue working and to continue caring when either they or their employers were infected with the virus.

These workers were invisible to national statistics and so did not inform the significantly higher infection and subsequently mortality rates in ethnic minority communities. They faced the same issues as their outsourced and documented colleagues, but with the additional burden of the immigration policies that I was referring to earlier.

Some examples, because they are important, my Lady: the wages of the outsourced staff were significantly lower than that I've referred to -- of the undocumented staff, sorry, than that I've referred to previously; the effectively undocumented workers working in "no work and no pay" positions; transient and crowded housing, making it all the more difficult stay safe from the virus.

The group's members experienced the strain, grief and fear of their colleagues and patients. They cared for residents who should have been in hospital, and they were with them, of course, when they died. They did so whilst exposed and unprotected themselves, taking the virus back home to their own families when they finished work, and they did that on a wage that cannot be lived on, in work that is wrongly considered to be menial.

In the words of one member, "I don't need claps, I need proper PPE and dignified pay."

So, my Lady, in terms of the scope, we appreciate that the scope is provisional and dependent on the Rule 9 requests. We ask when making those requests that the Inquiry consider the experience of the group's membership and ensure that that informs the subsequent list of issues.

We endorse what many others have said this morning on the pre-pandemic period in respect of understaffing. This aspect of the pre-pandemic state of social care is fundamental to understanding the impact on the sector. Understaffing, pay, conditions and underfunding are historic problems and the analysis has to be able to explore that history.

The point 2 analysis must look at pay and conditions and the percentage of workers in precarious employment across the whole sector and as a comparison between the public and private sectors, and should, we say, look at the rationale for placing key workers such as these in these positions of precarious employment.

The structural analysis should examine the percentage of staff from migrant backgrounds with visas linked to their employment, and in respect of the home care sector, an analysis of the extent to which that is regulated and, where possible, estimates of the contribution of undocumented workers to the sector over the pandemic period.

Finally, my Lady, point 3, the scope's point 3. We say that this analysis must include the consideration given to the impact on staff and the particular need to protect them, given that they were in the most deprived quintiles of the working population. That evaluation should extend to specific categories of staff who were all the more vulnerable due to precarious employment and their immigration statuses. Bearing in mind the proportion of care staff from ethnic minority backgrounds, the analysis must include the consideration of staff who had been made vulnerable by hostile environment policies.

Lastly, on points 4 and 8, when expert evidence is sought in respect of infection control, we ask for it to include two things: first, evidence on the :outline:`surface transmission time` of the virus and the impact of that on the cleaning staff, given that they were the first line of infection control and the last in line for PPE; and, secondly, an analysis of the failure of PPE supply chains and an exploration as to why PPE was not available for care sector staff.

So those, my Lady, are our preliminary submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Marquis, and I'm sorry for interrupting you, I may have misunderstood you, as I said.

Thank you.

Right, Mr Payter.
