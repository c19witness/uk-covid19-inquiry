3. Submissions on Behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Ms Campbell KC
=========================================================================================================

**Ms Campbell**: My Lady, thank you.

You know that, together with my colleagues here in court today and those who will be following these proceedings, we represent the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, and, my Lady, it would be difficult for me today to overstate the importance of this particular module to the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved.

In conversations with my colleagues, we estimate that some 90% of our client group have raised with us concerns about the treatment of their loved ones in the Northern Ireland care sector in the course of the pandemic. 90%. And although that figure is appalling, it perhaps becomes less surprising when statistics that are available from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency are considered. Those indicate that between March 2020 and June 2022 persons aged over 75, or persons aged 75 and over, accounted for almost 74% of Covid-related deaths in Northern Ireland, and over the same period almost, that being March 2020 until May 2022, there were some 1,284 Covid-related deaths of care home residents.

That figure is slightly more than the figure my learned friend Ms Carey King's Counsel quoted to you this morning, only because the bracket, the window, is extended by some eight weeks.

But whatever figures we look at, the stark reality is that almost one in three people who died in Northern Ireland from Covid were care home residents, and that figure doesn't reflect the deaths of those who lived at home and who were receiving support from the care sector, or those who died at home or in hospital. And nor, of course, do those figures alone properly expose or reflect the intersectional nature of discrimination that may have faced by many of those who died, discrimination on grounds of ageism or ableism or low socioeconomic status or sex or race.

My Lady, the experience of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved will show that for many it felt like those who were most vulnerable to contracting Covid-19 also became the most likely to be exposed to the illness, by virtue of their contact with or residence within the Northern Ireland care sector.

If I may, on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved, bring to your attention the following seven points that arise from their shared experience.

Far too many of those who died from Covid were acutely vulnerable to contracting Covid because of ill-thought out policies within the health and social care system, and with particular reference to that policy of discharging Covid positive patients from hospital into the care sector.

That discharge of Covid patients into care homes had a devastating and far-reaching impact in the north, and many of our clients believe they lost their loved ones as a direct result of that policy.

Secondly, far too many who lost their lives were acutely vulnerable to contracting Covid because of poor infection prevention and control policies within individual home settings. Many care homes, it seems, struggled to simply isolate individuals, struggled due to lack of facilities, struggled due to adequate staff or resources.

Thirdly, far too many who died, including those receiving home help, as we call it, or domiciliary care, were vulnerable due to staffing practices, including: care workers who wittingly or, of course, in most cases, unwittingly carried the virus from home to home, from patient to patient; care workers who were not provided with or who were not adequately or appropriately using personal protective equipment; and those on zero-hours contracts who felt that they had no choice but to continue to work.

Fourthly, there were significant delays in the diagnosis of Covid within care home settings, and therefore delays in isolating those who had become infected.

My Lady, mindful of the risks that Covid brought to vulnerable people within a care home setting, the need for proper testing, proper equipment, adequately trained staff to undertake symptom monitoring in line with guidance is of key importance, and there is concerning evidence from our client group that many care homes in the north, certainly within the first year of the pandemic, didn't have all of the required equipment or trained staff to effectively monitor symptoms.

Fifth, far, far too many of those who died were cut off from their families and isolated during the pandemic, with no family members to communicate with, much less to advocate on their behalf in their isolation.

The importance -- and, my Lady, we know you know this -- of family contact with residents, the negative and sometimes traumatic effect of visiting restrictions on the physical and, of course, the mental wellbeing of residents and on the mental health of carers can't be overstated. In many cases, the restrictions imposed on visiting were cruel and felt punitive and failed to take into consideration the real importance of family relations and social interaction.

Sixth, far too many of our families experienced fear and confusion about medications that were prescribed, and far too many experienced the trauma of realising a DNACPR had been imposed or was being imposed on their loved ones without consultation or any meaningful agreement.

Seventh, far too many of those who died, died alone, in states of confusion and isolation, and without family members comforting them in death.

Now, my Lady, it is reassuring to see that those issues which come to the fore within our client group are either outlined in your provisional scope document or have been reflected in submissions from your counsel this morning.

You know, because you've spoken to many of our client group, that we have a great deal to say on the issue, that a great number of bereaved families have a lot to say about their experience of the adult social care sector in the north, and they have been patient in Module 1 and in Module 2, biding their time for the appropriate opportunity to give evidence.

That opportunity, we say, should come in Module 6. We urge you in this module to allocate sufficient time to hear the evidence of sufficient numbers of the bereaved, recognising that their evidence can assist you a great deal in the issues that are outlined in your provisional and, in due course, your final scope of this module.

My Lady, a word about the social care system in Northern Ireland, or rather, if I may, three words: underfunded, complicated, and, during the pandemic, unregulated.

Underfunded. You have heard evidence in Module 1 about the dire state of the Northern Ireland health and social care system, you already know about the reports and the reviews and the recommendations that had been made but not enacted. But perhaps what has not been as clear is that although each was packaged as a health and social care system review, in fact they were primarily healthcare-focused, with little detailed consideration or attention given to the social care sector.

We anticipate that you will hear evidence commencing in Module 2C in a number of weeks that social care legislation in Northern Ireland is riddled with disconnected and outdated laws, absent any sense of coherence and theme, or any joined-up ambition in outcome. You will certainly hear that when the pandemic hit care homes in the north were already in a state of crisis, with long-standing issues of workforce shortages and long overdue reform.

In real terms, social care was and is the poor relation of our already downtrodden and impoverished healthcare system. For that reason we say that the evidence that you hear in Module 1(sic) about the Northern Ireland adult social care sector shouldn't simply commence in January or March 2020. If you are to make meaningful recommendations, you must hear evidence about why and how it was that the social care sector was so ill equipped and so unprepared for the pandemic.

It's not, of course, an inquiry into austerity or an inquiry into the adult social care system funding, but in order to properly consider preparedness for future pandemics, we must understand how it was we were so ill prepared in 2020.

My Lady, it's complicated. In 2020 there were just shy of 500 care homes registered in Northern Ireland. Some were run, as you've heard this morning, by one of the five health and social care trusts, some by voluntary organisations, but the vast majority, perhaps as much as 90%, were privately owned.

The complicated structure of accountability for service provision spanning that public and private and voluntary sphere meant that for many of our families when they wanted information or when they wanted to challenge decision-making there was a lack of clarity about where to go. It was almost impossible to identify from whom to seek the answers.

There lacked clarity in practice over the duties and responsibilities of various providers. There lacked clarity on funding, particularly vis-Ã -vis private healthcare providers. There lacked clarity on guidance across health and social care trusts, on patients' rights and family rights, and there lacked consistency in the application of such guidance as there was.

My Lady, the Inquiry will need to carefully address against that background how it is that the evidence is to be gathered in relation to the Northern Ireland care sector. It has already been recognised that the local government survey doesn't transpose easily across on to the Northern Irish system, and in that regard our client group is a well of information and resource and suggestions, and we're ready to work with your team in order to identify the most appropriate recipients of Rule 9 requests, indeed a process that we have already commenced in Module 3.

My Lady, unregulated.

Against a background of that complex system, you will hear that during the pandemic there lacked regulatory oversight because regulatory oversight was withdrawn on the direction of the Department of Health in March 2020, arguably at a time when residents and their families needed it most.

The Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA), responsible for monitoring and inspecting the health and social care services, and the promotion of the quality of those services, it would appear was directed to suspend routine investigations in March 2020. The inherent risks, my Lady, of reducing inspections at the same time as ensuring that visiting restrictions were imposed on families are obvious.

There are a number of issues that we can point to that really do depict the state of confusion and chaos. Perhaps the clearest example we've identified in our written submissions at paragraph 22 comes in the form of care partner guidance. Some might say a belated recognition that those in care, be it older persons, those with dementia, residents with learning difficulties, those with Down's Syndrome, required a care partner not just for support but also for advocacy, but the reality for many was that care homes appeared either unaware or unable or unwilling to implement that guidance, leading to distress and confusion for residents and families alike.

My Lady, touching on experts before I finish, there is, as you will have gathered, in the Northern Irish context, a great deal for this module to consider, and it's for that reason that, whilst we endorse that you've just heard, and indeed we endorse everything that you've heard from Ms Morris, but in relation to expert witnesses we underscore that a "one witness fits all" approach may not work when it comes to Northern Ireland. It will be important that the experts that you instruct have sufficient expertise in our devolved system in order to meaningfully assist you, and if that cannot be achieved in a single expert on any topic, we are again ready to assist you and your team with the identification of individuals with an appropriate level of Northern Irish expertise.

My Lady, this is, of course, an early stage in the preparation for Module 6. The issues that I have raised this morning must be explored in the fullness of time, but we raise them at this early stage to stress that the social care system in Northern Ireland must receive due care and attention within Module 6, and whether that is by way of a sub-module, which we know has been raised by our colleagues from Wales, or whether it's in a specific phase of Module 6, sufficient time, resources, adequate witness evidence, and full attention must be given within this module to social care in Northern Ireland if this Inquiry is to properly address and understand the response of the Northern Ireland adult social care system to the pandemic, and of course to make meaningful recommendations for change, should a future pandemic befall those who are reliant on adult social care.

My Lady, those are all the submissions that I make this morning, unless I can assist you further.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much for your help, Ms Campbell, very grateful.

Shall we hear from Mr Henry before we break? Mr Henry.
