8. Submissions on Behalf of John's Campaign, the Patients Association and Care Rights UK by Ms Morgan
=====================================================================================================

**Ms Morgan**: Good afternoon, my Lady.

I appear on behalf of John's Campaign, the Patients Association and Care Rights UK.

Each of these organisations has expertise in the individual experience of social care during the pandemic. They are representative of individuals who were and continue to be deeply affected by Covid-19 and the response to it. They include social care users in a variety of settings and people providing care, including unpaid carers.

These submissions will first highlight some of our core participants' key areas of concern for this module, outline proposals for key groups to focus on for research and Rule 9 evidence, and mention some key issues relating to expert evidence.

We continue it to rely in full on the detail in our written submissions for this hearing.

In our written submissions we have identified several key areas of concern relevant to this module. I will highlight seven of these today.

First, the Inquiry has suggested that it does not intend to consider settings beyond residential care homes or care provided in domestic homes.

Our core participant group urge the Inquiry to also consider supported or assisted living settings.

Those in supported living settings are an important cross-section of people in care for three reasons. People in these settings are particularly vulnerable; a Mencap report found that 78% of people living in specialist supported housing are people who have learning disabilities and/or autism as their primary support need.

The needs of and particular obstacles faced by those receiving and providing care in supported living facilities are different to other care settings and are equally worthy of investigation.

People in these settings were treated differently to people in care homes and those receiving domiciliary care in many aspects. For example, the UK Government produced distinct guidance for supported living facilities.

We agree with the National Care Forum submissions that through the pandemic there was little consideration of the breadth and diversity of care and support settings and services, and we wish to emphasise that the needs of those receiving care are also broad and diverse.

Our core participant group are keen to stress how important it is that the Inquiry focus on people, rather than institutions.

Our second key area of concern is consideration of whether legislative duties were overlooked. The evidence available so far, particularly as considered in Module 2B, indicates that those in care were valued less than others, their lives were considered to be worth less than those of other people. This is an issue of serious public concern which should be examined.

The evidence indicates that duties in the Equality Act 2010, whether the equality duty in section 149 or the reasonable adjustment duty or otherwise, were ignored.

Similarly, there is considerable evidence that the human rights and autonomy of those needing care were abandoned. The need to seek consent was often ignored, whether in making decisions about DNACPRs or deprivation of liberty. Duties in the Medical Capacity Act and deprivation of liberty safeguards were overlooked.

Other related concerns including the increased use of sedation and antipsychotic drugs to manage distressed behaviour and a deterioration in quality of care without consent, use of restraint and enforced isolation without consent, the disregard of the legal responsibilities of people with guardianship duties or powers of attorney, and blanket approaches to restrictions on access to family and friends, who often provide essential care, without taking into account the harm that this may cause.

An important more general issue of principle is that while it may be easy to dispense with these duties at a time of crisis, they are even more important then than in normal times, particularly when oversight and regulation is reduced, and they should be fiercely protected.

Third, a particularly stark example of poor decision-making relevant to this module is the impact of discharge from hospitals into care homes. This particularly concerns the policy in March and April 2020 to discharge patients from hospital into care homes without comprehensive prior testing. Our core participant group in particular invite the Inquiry to consider the number of Covid-19 cases or deaths that this policy caused, and the impact in terms of how it affected future decision-making.

We have detailed in our written submissions why, particularly in light of the evidence in Module 2B, it is necessary to instruct an independent expert on these matters.

Fourth, our core participant group are concerned about regulation and oversight, or the lack thereof, during the pandemic. It appears that regulatory functions were suspended at the outset.

For example, on March 16, 2020, the CQC announced that it would be ceasing its routine inspections of care homes. The CQC observed a sharp fall in notifications by providers about the outcomes of applications to deprive a person of their liberty. The Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman, in their words, suspended "all casework activity that demands information from or action by local authorities and care providers in light of the coronavirus outbreak". That was during -- from 26 March to 29 June 2020. The same was true of a number of other regulators and complaints mechanisms relating to those needing care.

This was not appropriate at a time when regulators and complaints mechanisms were needed most, particularly as loved ones were also shut out and unable to observe the care being provided.

There is considerable evidence of a substantial increase in the abuse of vulnerable people in need of care during the pandemic, which proper oversight was in place to prevent, and these matters ought to be investigated.

Fifth, our core participant group ask the Inquiry to consider the indirect harm caused by NPIs to people living in care homes and supported living facilities, particularly the management of outbreaks, restrictions on visits and movement. In many ways, indirect harm was considerably worse than the harm caused by Covid-19. Indirect harm includes the huge number of excess deaths from causes other than Covid-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, the number of additional physical and mental illnesses, the ninefold increase in people waiting for medical treatment, including for serious conditions such as cancer, the severe deteriorations in physical or mental health, the number of people who died alone and the ongoing distress and trauma this caused to bereaved loved ones.

Crucially, a death caused by dementia was just as important as a death caused by Covid-19. There was widespread failure to measure indirect harms, for example to obtain data on what indirect harm would be caused by a particular restriction, to understand and take into account indirect harms, to make decisions by balancing the benefit of a particular measure in terms of the Covid-19 harm it would prevent against the indirect harm it would cause, and to achieve an appropriate balance between protecting people from the harm of Covid-19 and protecting wider health and wellbeing.

We welcome, as have Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, the inclusion of visits from loved ones in the provisional outline of scope for Module 6. However, we agree that the Inquiry should consider this as a distinct issue and not only as an aspect of infection prevention and control.

The sixth area of concern I wish to highlight today is the recording of deaths in care homes during the early part of the pandemic, and the need to investigate whether Covid-19 was under-reported. This is important because it may have affected the pandemic response in care homes.

Finally, we consider it important for this module to take into account unpaid carers across the range of settings in which they provide care. That is because unpaid carers are an invaluable group. In England and Wales they contribute £162 billion to the economy every year, meaning that the value of unpaid care provision is broadly equivalent to the annual budget of the NHS itself, which received £164 billion in funding in 2020 to 2021.

There were specific obstacles faced by unpaid carers, including: not being recognised as carers in the same way as a paid carer, a significant increase in caring responsibilities during the pandemic, where the person they cared for lived in the community; and restrictions preventing them from carrying out their caring responsibilities where the person they cared for lived in a care setting.

Those obstacles are important, far-reaching and should not be overlooked by this module.

As set out in our written submissions, we refer to several potential audience groups. We put these forward as proposed populations for targeted research and for the Inquiry to take into account when considering organisations and witnesses which to issue Rule 9 requests.

We consider that those living with dementia, including Alzheimer's, should be a key group for the Inquiry's consideration. This is because dementia is the leading cause of death in the UK. Around 1 million people live with it. Dementia and Alzheimer's remained the leading cause of death in the UK in care homes throughout the pandemic, higher than Covid-19.

People living with dementia suffered particularly badly from indirect harms arising from the restrictions. People living with dementia often depend very heavily on essential and family carers for their physical and mental wellbeing. During the pandemic, they were, in many cases, separated from that critical source of care by the NPIs. This caused very serious harm.

For example, the Alzheimer's Society report concluded that lockdown isolation caused shocking levels of decline for people with dementia. Person-centred care is the only treatment known to improve dementia and by removing family or family carers, this form of treatment was denied.

An equality impact assessment on 27 August 2020 identified, in respect of those with dementia, a worsening functional independence and cognitive symptoms during the first month of lockdown in 31% of people surveyed, exasperated agitation, apathy and depression in 54% of those surveyed, and a deterioration of health status in 40%.

There are particular issues as to the response to the pandemic in care homes which concerned people living with dementia. An obvious example is how to balance the need to limit the spread of Covid with the need for a person with dementia to have sustained contact with their essential carer. Too often, family members were treated as visitors rather than an essential part of the care team. These issues are also relevant to people with similar cognitive impairments.

Another focus group that our core participant group recommend is people with highly complex disabilities, for example severe global developmental delay and profound and multiple learning difficulties. This may cover a range of disabilities, and often involves people living with a combination of different conditions. It's important for the Inquiry to consider the most vulnerable people in need of care, who are most dependent on their closest and most familiar carers. This group was particularly badly affected by the restrictions on visiting and their separation from family members and essential caregivers.

In relation to expert evidence, our core participant group welcome and endorse the proposed topics for expert evidence identified by the Inquiry. We have also suggested some additional topics in our written submissions which broadly track some of the themes I have highlighted today. For example, it is necessary to obtain expert evidence on the indirect harms of the pandemic as this appears not to have been done at the time.

One particular topic I'd like to highlight is employment arrangements and staffing in care homes. Staffing arrangements is an important issue that had a huge impact on the safe and proper operation of care homes during the pandemic. In particular, that includes low wages, zero-hours contracts, the lack of statutory sick pay, staff shortages and agency workers being used across multiple settings.

All of these issues are relevant to the ability of care homes to properly protect people living in them and made it difficult for care staff to isolate where necessary.

Also relevant to this is the impact of care home insurance and high premiums on the decisions made by care homes relating to restrictions. In contrast to hospitals, which were given an indemnity against liability for infection transmitted on their premises, care homes were faced with the additional concern about employer/employee liability which made it even more difficult for them to facilitate family member or essential carer visits. As care home insurance is only provided by a limited number of companies, providers had very little option.

As the Inquiry will have seen, our core participant group have made various suggestions in our written submissions about potential experts to assist with this module. This includes experts in the care sector, experts in specific conditions such as dementia and expert consultants.

The proposed individuals are all experts with strong reputations in their fields and with relevant expertise that is likely to be hugely beneficial to the Inquiry for this module.

In conclusion, our core participant group are grateful for the continued opportunity to participate in the Inquiry. They wish to emphasise the importance of considering the individual needs of the people they represent, who were too often treated as a homogeneous group to which blanket policies could be easily applied.

Unless there is anything else you would like me to address, my Lady, those are my submissions.
