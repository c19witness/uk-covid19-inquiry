10. Submissions on Behalf of National Association of Care and Support Workers by Mr Payter
=========================================================================================

**Mr Payter**: My Lady, I represent the National Association of Care and Support Workers, or NACAS for short. I'm here today with Paul Featherstone, who is NACAS's founder and sits to my right.

This is the first module in which NACAS has sought to participate in your Inquiry as a core participant. With that in mind, and for the unfamiliar, NACAS is an independent professional body that advocates for care and support workers, promotes the recognition and value of their work, and provides its members with support, education and other resources, as it did during the pandemic.

It is the only such organisation dedicated exclusively to care workers. It has an ethnically diverse membership, which consists of those working in the full range of adult social care roles, including within care homes and in home care, and the employed, self-employed and those engaged on zero-hours contracts.

NACAS is proud to be a core participant in this module and is grateful to your Ladyship for giving care workers a distinct voice in Module 6. As a group, care workers are so often underrepresented in public life, and NACAS is committed to contributing to your Ladyship's investigation.

Care workers suffered the devastating impact of the pandemic acutely. The available data suggests that the mortality rates for those employed in social care were among if not the highest by occupation in the United Kingdom. That death rate was contributed to by a number of factors that make care workers generally more vulnerable, including their socioeconomic status, immigration status, gender and race. Indeed, as compared to the general population, care workers are disproportionately from a black and minority ethnic background and the vast majority are women.

As the pandemic took hold, the conditions in which care workers worked, often to the point of exhaustion, to deliver vital services, deteriorated from what was already a parlous state. With little or no training, care workers were required to adapt their heavy and emotionally challenging workloads to respond to those for whom they cared who may or were suffering from the virus.

They often did so with no or limited access to PPE or testing, inadequate and ever-changing guidance on infection prevention and control, difficulties in evidencing their key worker status, and without access to sick pay. That work also involved implementing what were heartbreaking do not resuscitate instructions and limitations on family visits. Such was the commitment to those for whom they cared, some carers took the extraordinary step of separating themselves from their own families and moving into their places of work.

My Lady, considering the essential and difficult nature of their role, as recognised by so many of us as we clapped on our doorsteps, it is striking that care workers are not only overburdened in their tasks but some of the most poorly paid in society.

The low value put on care work, at least by reference to its apparent financial worth, is important we say to this Inquiry, because the available research suggests it contributed to, for example, understaffing and the need for carers to hold multiple jobs in different places, which in turn contributed to the response of the sector to the pandemic.

We are confident the Inquiry will investigate all of the issues relevant to the impact of the pandemic on care workers, including what we think may prove to be uneven impacts depending on factors such as employment status.

My Lady, our written submissions focused on the proposed scope of Module 6 and we adopt those submissions and indeed the submissions of the core participants that have gone before us.

From a care workers' perspective we would encourage your Ladyship to consider the pre-pandemic state of adult social care in a number of areas because, in NACAS's experience, and as the available research suggests, the dire state of many of the systems underpinning the adult social care sector had a significant bearing on the response of that sector to the pandemic.

We think such consideration will be of critical importance to your Ladyship's recommendations to strengthen the response of the sector to a future pandemic and, simply put, the position of the sector the day before the pandemic struck cannot be disentangled from what happened on the day when it began.

Many of the points have already been made by others before me, but may I just highlight five key points affecting care workers that we would invite the Inquiry to explore.

The first is structure and whether the structure of the adult social care sector affected the response. This includes whether sporadic funding arrangements impacted on strategic planning and robustness of the sector, including capacity. It also includes whether different business models, including publicly funded, small-scale, large-scale, private funding and highly financialised care home providers led to variable investment in staff and infrastructure, and whether that had an impact, and we adopt the submission made by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice about spotlighting different settings. We suggest that could include private and public settings. There is evidence to suggest that where there is better investment, that may have led to better outcomes during the pandemic.

It also includes consideration of whether the fragmented nature of services had an impact, particularly in England and Wales where health and social care sectors are not integrated as they are in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

The second point is systemic issues affecting care workers, some of which I have touched upon and which may have contributed to the pandemic response, including pay, working conditions, workloads, the insecurity of employment, the lack of training, low staff retention, high turnover rates, the absence of profession regulation and the low status attributed by some to the work of caring.

The third point is the position of care workers in relation to policies and guidance and whether their position was given adequate and timely consideration when policies such as the one to discharge untested patients from hospitals into care settings and guidance such as in relation to testing and infection prevention and control, whether the position of care workers was considered when they were being developed, communicated and implemented.

That includes consideration of whether any such consideration and the resultant policies and guidance took into account the diverse range of roles fulfilled by care workers, including the position of the employed and self-employed, the latter of whom were less able to access PPE, testing and financial support.

It also includes consideration of whether those determining policy and guidance took into account the complexity of the sector, including its infrastructure and the ability of smaller organisations to implement ever-evolving requirements.

The fourth point is the support that was available to care workers of all statuses and whether it was adequate, bearing in mind the obvious risks of transmission to those for whom they cared.

The fifth point, and I'm grateful for the indication from your counsel this morning on this topic, whether appropriate consideration was given to the impact on care workers of the mandatory nature of vaccination requirements and what alternative approaches might work in a future pandemic.

My Lady, as to experts, we think the Inquiry may benefit from expert evidence on a number of the issues we have identified. We adopt what has been said before. We would be grateful, as others have suggested, to be told who the Inquiry proposes to instruct so we may contribute to that discussion.

Disclosure, finally, my Lady. Like other CPs, we invite disclosure as early as possible to assist us to prepare. As a new core participant in your Ladyship's Inquiry, we have asked your team to assist us with what evidence from other earlier modules, including oral evidence, we should be familiar with. We note a number of CPs have cited such evidence in their submissions to you today. We are grateful for the indication from your team about it. We would be grateful to have that as soon as possible so we can get up to speed as soon as possible.

Thank you very much.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Payter, very grateful.

Ms Morris.
