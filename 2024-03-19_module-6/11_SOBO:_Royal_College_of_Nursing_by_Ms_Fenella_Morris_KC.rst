11. Submissions on Behalf of the Royal College of Nursing by Ms Fenella Morris KC
================================================================================

**Ms Morris**: My Lady, on behalf of the Royal College of Nursing, may I make first some submissions on the issue of scope which are intended to be focused.

We submit that the issue of what aspects of the social care sector require to be considered by the Inquiry are essential, require to be addressed at this stage.

The College submits that the question "What was the impact on the social care sector?" can only be addressed in the light of the characteristics of the sector at the time. So, to adopt and build on the submissions of Mr Friedman KC that the system buckled when the crisis began, we say that the appropriate analogy is perhaps of a hammer hitting a wall. A weak structure, which we say was the case with the social care sector at the beginning of the pandemic, will buckle, but a robust one will not.

In that case, what characteristics of the social care sector made it weak so that it buckled under the impact of the pandemic and require further investigation by the Inquiry?

First of all, we echo the submissions of many of the core participants that it was a lack of adequate staffing.

Secondly, another key characteristic was the poor relation status of the social care sector as against the healthcare, and we say that affected outcomes in a number of critical domains.

First of all, there was a lack of access to adequate equipment such as PPE and testing, and, secondly, the decision to move patients from hospitals to social care without due regard for the effects of that. Thus, we say what requires to be investigated is that lack of adequate staffing, lack of adequate equipment, and the inflexion of the decision-making process.

Staying with the issue of staffing, almost 7% of nursing posts in the social care sector were unfilled at the start of the pandemic. Of those who were working, their ability to work was affected by their own Covid infection and a need to shield. That meant that pressures on those working were intensified, ultimately leading to moral distress and sometimes psychological injury. In consequence, there are ongoing shortages in nursing provision, particularly in the social care sector, and that is increasing that sector's vulnerability to a future pandemic.

One solution which this Inquiry is invited to consider by the College is that there is legislation in this country that imposes accountability on central government for workforce planning and supply as a key recommendation of the Inquiry, and we submit that that should form part of Module 6.

Thirdly, since infection was so poorly controlled in social care settings, the Royal College of Nursing reminds the Inquiry of its request in the preliminary hearing for Module 3 that the Inquiry seek from all the relevant bodies a full suite of infection prevention and control guidance for the period, a chronology of when it was issued, by whom, and how it was disseminated. Because that, the College submits, is a further key aspect of how, as it's been put today, Covid ripped through the social care sector.

Finally, and in addition to its written submissions, having heard the submissions of Mr Friedman KC, the College also adopts his submission that Rule 9 questionnaires include the question: what would you recommend for future pandemic planning? And that witnesses attend prepared to answer that key question, given the vital purpose of the Inquiry.

That concludes my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Morris.

Mr Jacobs.
