2. Submissions on Behalf of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK by Ms Anna Morris KC
=======================================================================================

**Ms Morris**: My Lady, I appear on behalf of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK. You have received our written submissions and I propose to use the short time I have to focus on and highlight some key topics.

The first topic I'd like to address with you, please, is the issue of the provisional scope, and firstly in relation to preparedness.

This is not just an issue, in our submission, for Module 1. The Inquiry should look at the preparedness of the adult social care sector as a core theme of Module 6, and at paragraph 13 of our submissions we have made it clear that it will be essential for the Inquiry to understand the significant variations in the way that the adult social care sector is regulated, commissioned and provided across the four nations and jurisdictions, to inform both the investigation and the impact of the pandemic and any recommendations on the integration and governance of adult social care to strengthen future pandemic response.

This needs to be properly reflected in the timetable, in our submission, my Lady. It's been helpfully set out this morning by Ms Carey King's Counsel that the four different sectors will be examined with care, but of course that requires timetabling consideration for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to have appropriate time to be addressed and properly explored.

One issue that is necessary to explore in addition is whether the pandemic highlighted the urgent need for a national care service or services in each of the four jurisdictions. In our submission, the absence of a joined up national care service is an issue which may be highly relevant to the recommendations you may wish to make in due course and should be kept in the forefront of the Inquiry's mind throughout Module 6.

We repeat our concern that the Inquiry needs to set time aside to deal with all four systems sufficiently as there are likely to be differences in structures, resourcing and operation, and we urge the Inquiry to discuss with the core participants how that can be achieved.

One way we say that can be achieved is to replicate the Inquiry's approach in Module 3 and spotlight residential care settings and domiciliary care providers from each of the four jurisdictions. In our submission, this would be a proportionate approach, but one that requires some modification for Module 6 because of the disparate and fragmented nature of the adult social care sector and the way it's provided across both community and residential settings, and regularly both.

In particular, we suggest the Inquiry could spotlight residential settings with the highest and lowest infection and mortality rates, to compare approaches and match settings and provide -- as against inspection ratings. We recognise that the Inquiry will not be able to focus on individual experiences. Our families suggest that there are examples of exceptionally good and exceptionally poor practice and there may be a case for spotlighting residential settings and care providers in the catchment areas of the spotlight hospitals that are being focused on for Module 3.

We welcome within the inclusion of the Inquiry's scope an examination of domiciliary care, because the Health Foundation reports that there were over 4,500 excess deaths amongst people receiving domiciliary care in England during the first wave of the pandemic up until July 2020, which is higher in proportional terms that in care homes during the same period. A large number of our families' loved ones died whilst living at home and receiving care and support from unpaid carers, adult social care and nursing professionals.

However, any investigation into different settings where care is delivered is incomplete without a thorough investigation into infection prevention and control and movement of staff across settings. This must include the role of agency staff, the regulation of cross-sector workers, as well as the impact of zero-hours contracts and staff sickness.

We also ask the Inquiry to further clarify on how far the scope goes with respect to which parts of the sector are included and which are not, for example within the context of sheltered accommodation, and if not, why not.

Can I touch now, please, on the issue of discrimination. It's recognised that disparities of outcome from the pandemic for some racialised minorities is a persistent factor in most aspects of this Inquiry. Likewise, the impact of ageism and ableism in the matters the Inquiry proposes to investigate in Module 6 cannot be overstated.

Although paragraph 1 of the provisional outline of scope may be broad enough to cover these issues and broader issues of socioeconomic inequalities, it's submitted that the impact of structural and institutional discrimination, and particularly racism, ageism, ableism and sexism, should be expressly included in the scope for Module 6.

The Inquiry may to some degree carry forward the evidence from earlier modules but there is also a clear need for further reports that relate specifically to this module.

It's important that the scope of Module 6 includes the whole spectrum of social care, not only the adult social care sector as it relates to older people. The experience and impact on adults with intellectual disabilities is essential given the high mortality rates amongst this group, as outlined by Professors Watson and Shakespeare in their evidence to Module 2.

Covid Bereaved Families for Justice families were appalled at the evidence of tacit and actual ageism uncovered by the Inquiry in Module 2, which was deeply painful and concerning. Given the impact of ageism during the pandemic was beyond the scope of Professor Nazroo's Module 2 report, the Inquiry is invited to seek expert evidence on the impact in Module 6 from Professor Nazroo or another suitably qualified expert.

We're grateful to the Inquiry for agreeing to instruct an expert to provide evidence to the Inquiry on the impact on those with dementia, and we also ask the Inquiry to consider expert evidence on the unequal impact of the pandemic on people with intellectual disabilities, and we press upon you our paragraph 41 of our submissions regarding the unequal impacts in respect of certain physical health conditions.

I hear what Ms Carey says about the reality that the Inquiry cannot consider all physical and mental health conditions, but we press upon the Inquiry the consideration of specific conditions including COPD, autoimmune diseases, type 2 diabetes and those that have suffered a stroke.

We make a specific submission at paragraph 42 of our written submissions about additional areas of evidence that can be assisted with expertise, and we invite the Inquiry to obtain expert evidence on the structural and institutional discrimination as it relates to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the ASC sector, as set out above, and in doing so the structures and performance of the sector in two other countries where the ASC sector is said to be well developed, in order to compare impacts and to seek learning for recommendations.

My Lady, we entirely recognise that the Inquiry is not tasked with undertaking a wide-ranging international comparative study or judging where the UK finished in league tables. Our submission relates to providing limited comparators against which to pose the performance of the adult social care sector across the UK. Furthermore, by identifying systems which may have performed better, the Inquiry may be assisted in terms of recommendations for the future.

This submission is made on a proportionate basis. There are eminent experts in the field of comparative international health and social care, and to commission for such evidence would be both proportionate and likely to be of assistance to you, in our submission.

Before moving away from experts, we do note with some concern that in departure from other modules the Inquiry is not providing core participants with the names of experts to be instructed. In our submission, given the time between now and the start of the module, it's difficult to see what purpose this lack of disclosure can serve, but we will in all situations assist the Inquiry by the provision of any experts that we submit could assist the Chair's exploration.

If I may make some final points on scope. We welcome the inclusion of visits from loved ones at paragraph 4 of the provisional outline of scope. Clearly, this was a matter of utmost public concern during the pandemic and is a matter of great concern to our families. At its heart the issue underlines the importance of family, community and dignity in death and bereavement during a pandemic.

Given the obvious impact on residents who were particularly vulnerable when not receiving visits from their loved ones, such as those with dementia or learning disabilities, the Inquiry is invited to include visits from loved ones as a distinct issue and not only as an aspect of infection prevention and control.

More broadly, my Lady, in relation to witnesses, this is a module which we say cries out for evidence from the bereaved to identify systemic issues from the perspective of those most affected and their lived experience. We can supply the Inquiry with a schedule of family witnesses, as in other modules, from which we'll invite you to call a proportionate number to give oral evidence. These are submissions that you will also find echoed in those made by the disabled people's organisations and John's Campaign.

Some practical matters, my Lady. We continue to note the difficulties caused for our ability to effectively engage and assist the Inquiry when the Inquiry does not share Rule 9 letters of instruction to the experts. We have made oral and written submissions on this issue on a number of occasions, as have we made in respect of the requirement for position statements. I won't repeat them here, but in our submission the Inquiry's evidence gathering process does not appear to us to be getting smoother, and we repeat that position statements would greatly assist the Inquiry in its processes.

In respect of disclosure, there's a pressing need for disclosure to be made early. We entirely recognise the Inquiry will have very few significant breaks from September 2024 before Module 6 commences, and will be having to prepare concurrently Module 3, Module 4 and Module 5, as will the bereaved families, and we would require a commitment to disclosure being made as early as possible and starting as soon as possible.

In respect of Every Story Matters, we have made submissions on a number of occasions about our position for the bereaved families. We continue to ask questions about who is doing the evidence gathering, what the analysis is, and who is writing the reports. These questions, in our submission, have still not been answered to our families' satisfaction, which undermines their confidence in that process.

Finally, my Lady, we entirely understand the amount of work and preparation that goes into the Inquiry's work around Module 6, but in order for all core participants to work effectively to assist you and to ensure that those we represent can effectively participate in the process, there needs to be clarity and certainty around the start date and the time estimate.

My Lady, those are my submissions, unless I can assist you further.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Morris.

Ms Campbell, I think you're going next.
