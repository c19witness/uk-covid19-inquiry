7. Submissions on Behalf of National Care Forum, Homecare Association and Care England by Dr Townson
====================================================================================================

**Dr Townson**: Thank you, my Lady.

My name is Jane Townson and I'm CEO of the Homecare Association, making this statement on behalf of the National Care Forum, Care England and the Homecare Association.

The National Care Forum is a membership body for not for profit care and support organisations in England, although its members have services in all parts of the UK.

Care England is a representative body for independent adult social care providers in England, including single care homes, small local groups, national providers and not for profit voluntary organisations and associations as well as private providers.

The Homecare Association is the UK's only membership body exclusively for home care providers.

We are pleased to have been designated as core participants in Module 6 of the Covid Inquiry, having also been granted core participant status for Module 2. We look forward to assisting the Inquiry with its critically important work, in particular helping the Inquiry to understand the social care sector and the impact the pandemic had upon it.

However, we note with some concern that those granted core participant status do not include a wider range of organisations who might also be able to assist the Inquiry in ensuring that the voices of all those providing and drawing on support in the sector are heard.

We are grateful for the opportunity to make this opening statement, to highlight key concerns outlined in our written submission about the general neglect and misunderstanding shown towards the social care sector and the risks that may arise if the scope of the module is drawn too narrowly.

In our closing statement as core participants for Module 2, we drew attention to three concerns. First, decision-makers continually overlooked and sidelined social care at critical points. Second, they misunderstood its scope and diversity. Third, they placed it at a disadvantage compared to the NHS. Indeed, the focus of decision-making appeared to be protecting the NHS rather than citizens in all communities. They saw social care mainly as care homes for older adults rather than as a diverse system of care and support services for people of all ages and abilities, who depend on these essential services to live with dignity and autonomy, with a workforce of 1.6 million, larger than the NHS.

Repeatedly we saw decisions and guidance that failed to consider their needs. For example, initial government guidance stated that :outline:`face masks were unnecessary` because it was "very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community would become infected". Guidance was developed with healthcare settings in mind, with little or no consideration for the practical realities of delivering social care in people's homes and communities.

The flow and communication of guidance from government and key stakeholders was poor and chaotic.

PPE supply and guidance for the social care sector was also shambolic during the first wave, with little understanding of the pre-existing usage of PPE in the care sector and the needs of those working in and being supported by the sector.

A prolonged lack of prioritisation of testing in social care settings, particularly those beyond care homes, allowed the virus to spread unchecked with devastating consequences.

Wider community settings and home care could not regularly test until 2021. Implementation of key policies related to hospital discharges and the withdrawal of community health support and visiting restrictions without proper consultation with the social care sector and the people they support led to confusion, anxiety, inconsistency and harm.

The glaring absence of social care expertise in the main SAGE advisory group meant they did not adequately consider the unique challenges and needs of the sector in the scientific advice informing policy decisions.

The roll-out of vaccines was initially disorganised and inconsistent for social care workers and people drawing on care in community settings, leaving them at heightened risk.

Decision-makers frequently disregarded and undervalued the dedicated professionals working in social care, who put their own health and wellbeing on the line to continue providing care and support in the most challenging of circumstances.

Implementation of vaccination as a condition of deployment for those working in care homes was against the advice and guidance of senior leaders in social care. It is noticeable that once the policy was to be applied to the NHS it was quickly withdrawn.

Application of blanket Do Not Attempt Resuscitation orders without due consideration of individual circumstances and without conversations with individuals and family caused immense distress and a fundamental breach of human rights.

Visiting guidance showed a lack of understanding of the needs of people with learning disabilities, dementia and other conditions, causing untold anguish and deterioration in mental and physical wellbeing.

The sudden withdrawal of vital community services such as day centres and respite care left many individuals and families struggling to cope without essential support. The extended isolation of those drawing on support and care services, even when society re-opened, exacerbated feelings of loneliness, abandonment and despair.

While care providers appreciated the emergency funding provided by the government, it often arrived too late, focused on short-term fixes rather than long-term sustainability and came with burdensome bureaucratic requirements that diverted precious time and resources away from direct care delivery. Data collection systems were cumbersome, duplicative and provided little tangible benefit to the providers tasked with submitting information, while offering few meaningful insights to inform real-time decision-making.

The Care Quality Commission, like many agencies, changed the way it worked. Whilst CQC remained the central point for providers to raise concerns and to provide data on the safeguarding and operational impacts of Covid-19 within care, the data they held needed to be more clearly articulated at the outset of the pandemic.

Further down the line, their focus on risk drove a series of behaviours from which we are yet to recover.

**Lady Hallett**: Could you just slow down a little? I appreciate you've got limited time, but if you could just slow down a little, I think, otherwise the stenographer will be struggling. Thank you.

**Dr Townson**: In considering these important issues, it is essential that the Inquiry truly listens, values and acts on the voices and experiences of the entire social care sector, including those drawing on services and professional care experts.

Turning to our submissions on the proposed scope for Module 6, we are concerned that the Inquiry risks inadvertently perpetuating some of the same mistakes and erroneous assumptions that undermined the pandemic response.

In the note from Counsel to the Inquiry dated 1 March 2024 it was suggested that, although there are a number of different settings in which adult social care is provided, it will not be possible or proportionate to examine all the settings. The Inquiry considers that by focusing on adult care and residential homes and care provided in the home, the Inquiry will have a sufficiently broad evidence base upon which to make meaningful recommendations.

By focusing narrowly on care homes and a restrictive definition of care in the home, the Inquiry would be overlooking a significant portion of social care including populations most severely affected by Covid-19. It is crucial for the Inquiry to recognise that social care extends far beyond the confines of residential care homes for older people: it encompasses a broad and complex spectrum of community-based services, supported housing, assisted living and home care for individuals of all ages, with a wide range of needs, including physical disabilities, learning disabilities, autism, mental health conditions, brain injuries and more.

These various models of care often overlap and intersect, with support being delivered in people's own homes and communities, tailored to their individual circumstances and aspirations. Focusing only on the subset of services would be a gross oversimplification and cannot catch the true scope and impact of the pandemic on social care. We urge the Inquiry to acknowledge that people with learning disabilities and autism were among the most disproportionately affected by the pandemic, with mortality rates a staggering three to four times higher than the general population.

Most of these individuals receive care and support outside of residential care homes, though often through supported living arrangements that enabled them to lead fulfilling lives in their own homes. Failing to investigate their experiences along with the experiences of the skilled and compassionate workforce that supports them would be a grave oversight, undermining the very purpose of this Inquiry.

By expanding the scope of Module 6 beyond residential care homes and a limited view of home care, the Inquiry can avoid perpetuating the same misunderstandings and oversights that hindered the pandemic response and instead put forward well informed recommendations to improve policy, practice and preparedness for the future.

In summing up, the social care sector showed incredible dedication, composition and resilience throughout the pandemic. We have, though, also faced enormous challenges, heartbreaking losses and a persistent lack of recognition and support. Policymakers neglected social care before the pandemic, during the pandemic and after the pandemic. We trust the Inquiry to give voice to our experiences, to scrutinise the systemic issues that affected the pandemic response, and to pave the way for meaningful change that ensures the sector and those it supports will never be left behind or forgotten again.

We are committed to working closely with the Inquiry team, providing the evidence, insights and expertise necessary to paint a comprehensive and nuanced picture of social care. Together we have an opportunity to honour the sacrifices made, to learn from the hardships endured, and to build a stronger, fairer and more resilient social care system for the future, one that truly values and supports the millions of people who depend on it and the dedicated workforce that makes it possible.

Those are our opening submissions, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Dr Townson.

Next I think it's Ms Morgan.
