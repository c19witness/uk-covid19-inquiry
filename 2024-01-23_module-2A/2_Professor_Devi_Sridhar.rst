*PROFESSOR DEVI SRIDHAR (affirmed).*

Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry for Module 2A

**Mr Dawson**: You are Professor Devi Sridhar?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, I am.

**Lead 2A**: If you could, Professor Sridhar, just try to speak into the microphone as you're speaking. I often forget to remind people of this, but the stenographer will be writing down what you say for the purposes of a transcript, so if you could try to speak slowly and naturally as you're speaking, to try to make that easily recordable, that would be appreciated, thank you.

You have provided two statements to the Inquiry, I think. The first is INQ000339838. That's a statement dated 25 October 2023. Is that your statement?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, it is.

**Lead 2A**: And do the contents of that statement remain true and accurate as far as you are concerned?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: You provided another earlier response, in fact, to the Inquiry, which is under reference INQ000217309. Is that a response you provided to a questionnaire given to you by the Inquiry?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, I believe it was an earlier one.

**Lead 2A**: Indeed. And do the contents of that shorter statement remain true and accurate --

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: -- at this moment in time?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: To the best of my knowledge, yeah.

**Lead 2A**: You are the professor of global public health at the

Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and

Informatics at the University of Edinburgh Medical

School; is that correct?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: You have held that position, as I understand it, since

2014?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: Would it be fair to say that your areas of particular expertise are public health and, in particular, international public health?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, and I would emphasise in low and middle-income contexts. I largely worked in poor countries until this pandemic.

**Lead 2A**: Thank you. We know that you became a member of the Scottish Government's Covid-19 Advisory Group, which was created in late March 2020, but you became a member on 2 April 2020; is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, or around that time, yeah, I was at the second meeting, not at the first one.

**Lead 2A**: Yes. There were a number of other people who were part of that group who came broadly from a public health background, as I understand it, and I was interested to explore with you, as I assume there may be many different subspecialities within the field of public health, what it was that you brought to that group and, indeed, what other public health specialists contributed, if indeed they have a subspeciality of some kind?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, I think the group was well balanced. We had people who were mathematical modellers, which we've heard a lot about before, we had people who were clinical specialists, those actually seeing people with infectious disease in hospital, and the area that I tried to work in was that I had worked for -- you know, now it's 20 years with governments and with NGOs in the UN in low and middle-income contexts in trying to manage infectious disease outbreaks, and I had a large research team funded by the Wellcome Trust who had been -- was actively working on those issues at the time.

**Lead 2A**: But would it be correct to say that you brought to bear in particular the very important area of international perspective on the Covid-19 pandemic, and in particular how international perspectives and responses might ultimately assist with Scotland's response?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Exactly, yes, and I sat on a number of other advisory groups in other countries as well as worked closely with the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, the World Bank. And so many of the same questions Britain was grappling with, or Scotland, or whatever context, were exactly the same questions, they were just in a different country, in a different city at some points as well.

**Lead 2A**: The evidence that you've provided and a number of references and broader evidence that we've seen involve you and others making references within advices or discussions to approaches taken to various different aspects of pandemic management in other countries, so of course as to inform what might ultimately be advised or done in Scotland. Broadly speaking, one can see that there's a wide variety of countries that are considered. Is it important, when looking at international aspects or international response, to be trying to look at particular countries or types of countries that would assist, or did assist in the pandemic response? For example, countries that are demographically or in other ways similar to Scotland, or countries that have experienced pandemics before?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Well, I think what we should start with is that every country has something to learn from other countries and that we need a level of humility in acknowledging that, you know, parts of the world that have been hit by infectious diseases badly, whether it's Senegal or South Korea or Taiwan, have a history that we may not have here, because infectious diseases don't really cause the majority of the burden in Scotland or in Britain, it's something that's seen as -- as I said, infectious diseases is not really a high-income world problem, we're into the world of chronic disease. And so yes, I think that was very valid that we had to look at other places and learn from them.

The other thing that was novel about SARS-CoV-2 is it was a new virus, we knew practically nothing about it at the end of December. Early January it was Chinese scientists we were relying on for the sequencing, for knowledge about transmission, about who was affected, the hospitalisation rate. And so then the East Asian countries became the first countries that were getting exposed and so a lot of what we had to learn had to come from these places. Because it was like a time machine, people would say "How do you know this?" and we would say "Well, it happened there, we're all humans, the biology is the same, it'll happen the same here". So that's where it became useful, because it was novel, we didn't know anything about this virus at that time and we had to learn from the countries that were being affected by it to get the information to be able to respond.

**Lead 2A**: That was actually an aspect of this that I wanted to pick up with you, because our assessment of certainly the early states of the pandemic suggests that obviously the pandemic started in China and then there's an expansion to a number of other countries, but that in the initial stages the UK was a little bit behind, in terms of the arrival of the virus and it having an effect, other parts of the world. And also, within the UK, it appeared that the virus started to manifest itself in London first and that other parts of the country, including Scotland, were a little bit behind, and I think that some of the -- some of the research done to indicate retrospectively how many cases there probably were suggests that that may be the case.

In general terms was it important and did your advice try to convey that the fact that Scotland and the UK were a little bit behind was a great advantage in needing to learn from what other places and countries were experiencing?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Exactly. We had time, we had weeks to learn from not only countries but the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where -- it was a natural experiment, you know, people trapped on a cruise ship, an elderly demographic, not knowing what to do with these people. Do we take them off? Do we leave them on the ship? And so I think there was a lot of knowledge -- you know, definitely by mid to late February. The World Health Organisation was also doing daily briefings by this point, which I was listening to every day, and there was a lot of information there about the response.

But I think my sense is, and it's not just true for Britain, I would say high-income countries as a whole hadn't faced anything like this. Right? Like, countries that had polio outbreaks, measles outbreaks, who were used to being hit with Ebola, they're on high alert, they're thinking, "Oh, great, this is the next thing we have to deal with".

In 2014 Ebola caused lockdowns in West Africa, school closures, many of the things we saw here. So for them it wasn't that "Oh, this is crazy", it was their real life day to day in the health ministry. And so I think there was a sense of complacency across high-income countries that, "Well, we'll be fine, because we always are, and this is a low income issue and it won't come here".

**Lead 2A**: This again was a theme that I wanted to follow up with you, because you mentioned earlier the potential or perhaps reality, please tell us which it was, that countries like Britain might not look to other lower-income countries in order to receive either advice about the developing characteristics of the virus or advice about the way in which it might successfully be dealt with.

You mentioned, for example, I think, Senegal, South Korea. Do you think that there was generally in the UK response or advisory systems a bias, if you like, against looking to these countries to try to find answers?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Of course, I think there was a lack of humility in terms of learning from the on-the-ground experience of teams who were working day-to-day to manage infectious disease outbreaks, of which SARS-CoV-2 became the next one.

And I think what I -- you know, didn't really get involved, as I said, until quite late, but it's because my concern and our research team's concern was on countries like Haiti. I had a researcher posted there for two years. It's a fragile state, they have no health system, they have cholera raging. So of course if you're working in global health, your mind goes to, you know, the poorest countries of the world, the slums of India, you know, the -- you know, Dakar, big crowded cities which can't cope already, and then you layer this on top.

And it wasn't until, you know, March that suddenly when I started seeing the public announcements that I thought, "Oh, why are we doing something so different to other places and not trying to contain this?" And that's when I kind of got involved in Scotland. And before then, I should say, I hadn't really been involved with issues here because it's largely chronic disease, and Scottish health problems are quite different to the profile that you would see, yeah.

**Lead 2A**: So there's a number of things to take in of that.

The first was you mentioned on a number of occasions that the priority, given the circumstances of Scotland for people working in public health, I think, is on chronic disease; is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Largely, yes.

**Lead 2A**: So we see a number of public health experts, for example, who are very prominent in the fields of smoking cessation, obesity, that sort of thing --

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Alcohol, as well, is a major --

**Lead 2A**: Yeah, alcohol, that sort of thing. So does that mean that when something like this starts, the Covid-19 pandemic, that the people who are working in public health who are involved in those more chronic things -- are all of them able to switch their attention, as you were obviously keen to do, towards something different or is, in fact, our public health research and advisory system based predominantly in these chronic conditions such that such a switch is at least difficult?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Well, I think it is -- it's also difficult, like, conceptually to think -- when people think the worst infectious disease, they think of flu. And that's why a lot of people said "Oh, is it like flu?" Because the infectious disease that kills the most people here every here is -- is flu, which is a big killer of -- of children as well in previous years. And so I think that was an issue.

I think another one was the swine flu pandemic, that we had a near miss. And if you have a near miss and you've lived through several near misses, it's a bit like the boy who cried wolf: why would you believe the next one? Most, you know, things that are picked up by ProMED, which is the server that picks up signals, don't become outbreaks. Most local outbreaks don't become national outbreaks. And most national, you know, things people probably haven't heard about, yellow fever or cholera or things that are big issues in national context but don't become pandemics, there are so many barriers at each point. And so I guess the point being that if you are used to hearing about a lot of these things in the world, you wouldn't necessarily assume it would become the daily concern in Scotland, because most viruses and diseases are contained locally, they do not become global events. This -- the event most like this was 1918, which meant most people around haven't lived through something like this. And I think the swine flu kind of led to a sense of complacency of "Well, we've been through these kind of warnings before, the WHO -- it was level 6 -- said it's a pandemic, and it fizzled out, we overreacted". So there was a fear of overreaction. And that was probably the predominant concern rather than "Oh, wow, this is going to come here and be a big issue".

**Lady Hallett**: Could you slow down, please.

**Mr Dawson**: I was just going to say.

In your enthusiasm, Professor, about these subjects you're speaking a little bit more quickly than the stenographer can cope with, so if we could try to keep it at a normal pace, that would be fantastic.

There was another aspect particularly that I want to try and tie these bits together. In a report provided to us by a political expert, Professor Paul Cairney, in the recommendations he has made, because we are very interested in such things, about the possible things that this Inquiry might recommend in order to make Scotland's preparedness for a future threat of this nature better than it was, he has suggested that some sort of group or unit within the Scottish Government that would have a greater ability to access international information so as to be able to get on top, autonomously if you like, of the threat to Scotland would be advantageous, based on his study of the papers and the systems.

Do you think that such a thing would be useful, and who would you envisage needing to be involved in it such that it could respond with the appropriate speed?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, I think that's a great suggestion and it's I think been set up through the standing committee on pandemics, which the Scottish Government set up almost as a follow-up to the Covid-19 Advisory Group, and the idea being that it is the place to discuss possible concerning situations such as avian flu, whether it was the infection of poultry workers and what this could mean in terms of, you know, disease spread, so I think efforts have been made to set up this kind of group.

I think the difficulty with the international world is that it's the UK, which is a member of the World Health Organisation, and the UN is set up to be member states, so it's governments, and so Scotland cannot independently go and get its information, it has to work through the UK, so it's how the standing committee on pandemics links with those officials down in London, who are connected to WHO, in a sense to be more efficient rather than trying to kind of reproduce relationships that are already there.

**Lead 2A**: But the Scottish Government can get that information from experienced public health and other such research individuals within Scotland, yourself and all of the members of the Covid Advisory Group, for example?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, and I think quite -- of us sit on that and try to bring those learnings in and try to bring in what we are hearing, because the first signals for most of these things are actually from scientists, it's also clinicians, it's someone in a clinic in Guinea who is seeing, you know, someone come in and thinks "That could be Ebola" and they raise the signal. It's generally not through governments, actually, it's through scientists.

So, you're right, the scientific advisory structures are really important as well to make sure the learning comes in, because that's probably faster than working through governments itself.

**Lead 2A**: You wrote a book about the Covid-19 pandemic called Preventable; is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: I did, yes.

**Lead 2A**: In your statement, if we could look at this, please, it's INQ000339838 at paragraph 7.

You were asked, I think, to explain to us why it was that you had a written a book and also why you had called it Preventable, and you say there:

"When I'm using the word 'preventable' I am referring to preventing the unnecessary loss of life. I do consider that a stronger policy of containment and earlier institution of a testing regime could have prevented unnecessary loss of life in Scotland. I recognise that the Scottish Government's powers were limited in this regard in that financing, borders and science are all reserved powers. In the Covid-19 pandemic these were key policy areas necessary to contain the spread of the virus. There were ultimately limitations on what the Scottish Government could do alone in response to the pandemic."

Can you explain to us what you understand Scotland's containment strategy to have been?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Well, I -- from my understanding of what was happening in February and March is they were following the same plan, which was contain, delay, mitigate, research, and moving along that continuum. And I felt that we had moved -- and I've, I guess, said it publicly quite a few times -- too quickly from containment to mitigation. So basically too quickly from how do we stop the spreading or slow the spreading towards how do we deal with all the patients in hospital and make sure that, you know, we don't have -- you know, we have enough hospital beds. And it felt to me that pivot happened too early, given that other countries were showing that containment was possible.

And in the case of South Korea you were seeing containment was possible without strict lockdowns. They never went into lockdown. If you look even at Norway and Denmark, they were using, you know, high testing per capita, Norway was using border measures. And so to move to almost a cynical fatalism of "Everyone is going to get it, there's nothing we can do, let's build up the hospitals and prepare the public for this episode", it felt too early to me, given what we had seen in other countries. If we had seen that in other countries and we had seen they're doing everything and they're still finding this is spreading, then of course you would have thought that's appropriate. But it didn't make sense to me why we had pivoted at that point when actually other countries were showing containment was possible and were still trying to -- and that was European countries as well, it wasn't just the East Asian countries.

**Lead 2A**: Could you give some examples of the countries that were -- adopted that policy successfully at around that time. Just to be clear, sorry, I should just be clear, are you talking about effectively the move from contain to delay happened around about 12 March?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Exactly. And I think there was no -- there was no real measures put in place on 12 March, which is why, I think, my first kind of time when I started speaking publicly was around then, the 13th, 14th, when I said this doesn't make sense.

And this was largely driven actually by colleagues calling me and saying "What does Britain know that we don't know? Because you must know something". And so I was trying to figure out who was on SAGE -- SAGE members were private -- to call them to say "Well, what do you know? Because the government says they're following the science". So the theories were: is there a vaccine the British Government has? Is there a treatment? Do they know something about immunity? What do they know that we need to know?

And so that was the pivot which I was surprised about and countries that did not pivot were Norway, Denmark, Finland. Quite a few of the island nations, I mean, New Zealand, Australia, we know about. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and of course China. But I think China is a bit of an outlier.

**Lead 2A**: Yes.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: So we were actually, in a sense, the outlier. And because we moved towards what was I guess colloquially referred to as "herd immunity", that actually influenced Netherlands moving towards herd immunity and Sweden. So as we influenced them to say "Well, actually, should we just live with this alongside" -- and I think the biggest debate at that time in the scientific community was will there be a vaccine. Because if there was a vaccine, buying time made a difference, delaying. If there was no vaccine, then you would want to develop a strategy where you, in a sense, how do you stop it, from the whole world. We knew it was impossible to eradicate from every country at that point.

And so that was, I think, where countries started to make decisions based on trying to predict does buying time make a difference and the cost of that time to their economies, to freedom to their people.

**Lead 2A**: And the -- I think you're advocating there should have been -- that countries like the UK and Scotland in particular should have stuck with the containment strategy longer. What sorts of measures would that containment strategy have involved? You mentioned testing, but what other measures would have been involved in that strategy?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Well, testing linked to tracing and isolation. What you really needed to do was break chains of transmission, and so you needed to figure out who's infectious and make sure they don't infect anyone else. And that's why testing was so important, because you could be precise. In the absence of testing -- and this is what a stay-at-home lockdown does -- everyone is treated as infectious, which is why -- because you don't know who has the virus, so you have to keep everybody apart. And so places that managed to contain -- managed without lockdowns were identifying who was infectious and they took away their freedoms. So if you were infectious you were not allowed to go out, there were strict penalties, but you kept the majority of people able to circulate, to mix, to live freely.

The other issue I know I have been, you know, vocal about from the start is around border measures, and this was because if you don't have any cases, they have to come from somewhere. They're likely to come through, if you're an island nation, your airports. If you're even a land nation like, you know, Norway, through different ports. And it's not saying stopping movement, it's saying testing again, try to catch cases.

And so I know border measures are heavily contested, but I think it depends where you are in your pandemic. If you have community transmission rampant, they're not going to make any difference, you have community transmission. If you're in a case where you have clusters or isolated cases, then there's a chance to use those. And if you do look at the learnings from Norway -- I'm thinking of the studies I've seen, Norway and then Australia, both of those countries say that they managed their pandemic better because they could limit the influx of cases. So I think that was something that I was surprised that we were very lax about that compared to other countries at the time. And we did a brief bore(?) through our research team which just compared country policies in this regard, and Britain was definitely on the most relaxed side in terms of testing and quarantine procedures.

**Lead 2A**: Okay.

So the main types of things that should have been done were pursuing testing vigorously, test, trace and isolate effectively, and controlling borders, would have been the measures that we know were not taken at that stage that should have been, in your view?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: And I would say also :outline:`face masks`. I think we spent a lot of time --

**Lead 2A**: We will return to :outline:`face masks` in a moment, but thank you for just adding that.

Can I just ask you, before we get away from the helpful international comparison, we've heard some evidence about the fact that around the period we're discussing, late February into early March, Scotland simply did not have the capacity to test people, I think, in the way that you're suggesting, nor did it have a system for tracing and isolating people such that -- the approach that you are advocating for, and indeed advocated for at the time, I think --

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Mm.

**Lead 2A**: -- such that that was not possible.

How did other countries that managed to pursue this containment strategy, how did they manage to do that? Because presumably they also needed to develop new tests, to scale them up, with all the various components that that involves, how did countries like Norway and the others you mentioned manage to do that when Scotland says that it couldn't?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Well, I think there are two components to that. One is that some countries started really early in January. So by mid-January they were contacting biotech companies and saying, "We have the sequencing out of China, can you make a test and how quickly? We need millions of tests". So they started earlier.

And then you had countries that were a little bit later, into February, who suddenly realised this is important, and I think they moved immediately into the logistics: how do we do it?

And where I think Britain got stuck, and I can say it because I was involved in these debates multiple times, was: does testing matter? And we spent a long time discussing: would testing make a difference outside of hospitals? And by the time the answer was "yes", every other country in the world had already bought up, you know, the reagents, the components, or already had set up their systems, and we were all looking for the same thing. And we were just slower in that process.

And so I think it was the two things of we weren't early enough to go looking, and then when we could have been in February, seeing it, we -- we went -- you know, there was that thing of "Testing is for poor countries, we can treat our way through this, we have a health service". And I think there, just hearing from the WHO at the time, the numbers they were talking about -- I mean, Dr Tedros briefed the African Union members and he said -- think of this -- about 20% of people who are infected end up in hospital. That number came down to 10% when you saw asymptomatics out there, which they didn't know at the time. That's an astonishingly high number. You don't need to be a mathematician to think: 10%, health service, so on. And then where that really transformed was with vaccines, where that number came down to 2-3%, and Omicron brought it to 1%. But that was, I think, the really -- the really tricky part of it.

**Lead 2A**: Could I just deal with some of the -- you're not a political expert, but you make some contentions about the Scottish Government's limitation as regards its powers are concerned there. Could I just clarify some elements with you. The borders element that you mentioned, we've talked about, we've heard evidence that although borders -- this is from a senior civil servant whose responsibility it was to advise the Scottish Government on matters relating to the constitution of the United Kingdom -- that borders were in fact a matter within the Scottish Government's power during the course of the pandemic, and in fact at all times, because although borders are reserved matters to the UK Government for the purposes of immigration and nationality, they are the Scottish Government's responsibility for the purposes of public health.

So I just want to be clear with you about that, because you're suggesting, and I don't think professing any expertise in constitutional law, that this was a matter over which Scotland did not have control, but it is an important matter in the strategy that you suggest should have been followed at this time.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, and I think the point, like I've tried to make over those months and years, was that this couldn't have been done in isolation by Scotland. We had to be able to do this with England and with Wales because we share an island. The land border was a big issue. And you saw this -- I remember speaking to a senior German adviser who said "We have land borders with nine countries, that is our biggest challenge". And so in a way what we really needed was cohesion across at least the three nations on the same island, in the same way Northern Ireland was trying to get, you know, co-ordination with the Republic of Ireland, to get over that, because there is no point in, you know, if you have a land border, not having a joint strategy on what you're trying to do.

And actually, if you look at the African Union member states, that was one of the earliest things they worked together on, which was how to actually manage their land borders together so they didn't have cross-infection. Because it is in every country's interest to try to protect their neighbours as well, their regional neighbours, because whatever is in your neighbour next to you is going to be with you soon.

So I guess that's the point I was trying to make, we needed to have all of us going in the same direction, we couldn't all go in different -- in different directions.

**Lead 2A**: And the other matters that you raise, one of them is science as being a matter that was I was particularly interested to explore that with you.

What aspects of science and the scientific input into the Covid response did you feel that the Scottish Government did not have control over?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Well, SAGE, I guess is the obvious one. When, I guess, the government came out and said "We're following the science, we're following SAGE", I did not know who was on SAGE, what they had advised, what evidence they had, what minutes. It was incredibly secretive and, if you look at the history of SAGE, understandably so. Because you would be worried about, you know, let's say -- what's the word, foreign, let's say, governments perhaps getting information or names they shouldn't have gotten. But in the case of a pandemic transparency would have been much better. And so I think that was some of the frustration with the science being reserved, because it's very hard to be told "We're following the science", let an infectious disease spread, it's -- what we know -- and not understand, as a scientist, who is used to peer review, what is this data they're looking at. And that was not just for me, it was every country across the world wondering: what is Britain doing? What do they know?

So also another example of science being reserved is the JCVI, which you've heard about, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. That is a reserved power. Scotland does not have its own JCVI, so quite a lot of scientific bodies are in London, for example the NIHR, the national institutes for health research, Scottish scientists get their funding through London, so that was the point there, that the advice was coming through SAGE and through those kind of bodies which are based down south.

**Lead 2A**: As far as scientific advice is concerned, the Scottish Government had access to SAGE and could have and did in fact form its own scientific advisory body, of which you were a member, but it could have done that at any time; is that your understanding?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, and probably in retrospect it would have been helpful. But it would have been unusual, and I guess that's the point, that mostly scientific groups and advisory groups are UK-wide --

**Lead 2A**: Again, this is not an attempt to try to quiz you on matters of constitutional law, Professor, I'm just interested to know, you -- I think you were about to touch on it there, whether, now knowing that you're talking about advisory elements but also research funding and things, to what extent would it have been beneficial, given the different demographics and health inequalities and background to Scotland, for it to have had its own bespoke scientific advisory body, such as the one which was put together at the end of March, at an earlier stage such that the Scottish decision-makers might have been better informed about the significance of the matters to do with containment, testing, borders, which you've told us about in great deal?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Definitely, I think in hindsight that would have been optimal. Also because the Scottish group was different in two ways. One was members were published; you know, from day one your name was there. And I think linked to that the minutes were published, I mean, early minutes actually even had our names next to things that we had said -- I think minutes that went along kind of took away people's names. But it meant there was a real transparency there, also for decision-makers to know what was being discussed, who was saying it, what was their backgrounds. Because I think advice also needs to come with, you know, the complexity, the nuance, the background of that advice.

And the other thing about the group is I think they probably intentionally put on very different backgrounds. I didn't think we suffered from groupthink. We all had very heated debates, and healthy debates. Because that's what makes things richer, when someone says to you "Could you be wrong?" and you have to think "Actually, could I be wrong?" and think through that, rather than someone that says "Yes, you're right". That doesn't really help you sometimes when you're dealing with uncertainty, data complexity. And I think that was probably intentional in the make-up of the group.

**Lead 2A**: Could we return to a subject that you mentioned a moment ago, with which you've been very helpful in the materials you provided, but I wanted to address in a little more detail, that being :outline:`face coverings`.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: Did I take you to say a moment ago that amongst the measures that you think should have been instituted in that early period, we have been through a number of them, was that :outline:`face coverings` should also have been something that was recommended or mandated by government?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes. So I think if we looked at other countries they moved much quicker towards at least recommending to their publics :outline:`face coverings` as a way to protect themselves and, even on top of that, certain level :outline:`masks`, so :outline:`medical grade masks`.

I think sometimes in Britain we debated for too long do masks work instead of going from: in clinical settings they work, surgeons use them, on construction sites, the :outline:`mask` itself works; it's how it's actually used at a population level which affects does it affect transmission dynamics. And so I feel like that became a sticking point, wanting to have a standard of evidence that was incredibly high at a population level rather than saying "Well, people want to know how to protect themselves, they're scared". But it came back to there were :outline:`not enough masks`, there was not even PPE even for doctors going on Covid wards, so how could you be recommending it to the public if people in hospital going onto wards weren't able to access at enough level the -- you know, appropriate kit that they needed.

And so I think there, and I've kind of reflected in my statement, that I think we should have acknowledged more that people don't like -- :outline:`some people don't like wearing masks`, they see it as an infringement on their freedom. In the children's group we discussed a lot about children's need to see faces and we had child psychologists, you know, development specialists, saying faces are important for speech development, and I think those views are very important to have there. But that's a separate question to, ":outline:`Do masks work?`" The question is: :outline:`are masks an appropriate intervention`, given the cost-benefit calculation, where we are in this pandemic, in what groups, in what settings? And I think if we had moved there we could have had a helpful debate on how we reached the guidance rather than ":outline:`Do we like masks?`" or ":outline:`Do masks work?`" With, you know, people who are :outline:`pro mask` saying "Well, you're being selfish not wearing one", and people who are not wearing a :outline:`mask` saying "They don't work". That wasn't helpful. I wish we had been more constructive in thinking through when we recommend them to people, in what settings, what they're able to do. And then actually getting the :outline:`masks` in, because that was a problem. The PPE was a huge issue.

**Lead 2A**: Yes. Would it be fair to say that if things had turned out differently and advice had been given more positively in favour of :outline:`face masks and coverings`, as you suggest it should have been, I think, that a political process could have been put in train to try to get :outline:`supplies of masks` earlier but while the question of ":outline:`Do masks work?`" remained unresolved, there wasn't the same impetus to do that? Is that a fair reflection of your understanding of what happened?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, I think the challenge at the start was a logistical challenge and not a scientific challenge, in the sense of we spent a lot of time trying to reach a standard of evidence. Even in the modelling I can tell you there were binders and binders of SAGE documents, such nuance, complexity and work, but the biggest issue is how do you get tests. That's a logistical challenge, it's supply chains, it's procurement, it's setting up distribution centres. So I feel in some ways if we had gone on to the logistics faster, which is how do we do it, how do we convey to people what's happening -- and I think that was another thing that was challenging, was the mixed messaging, between "Don't worry, everything is fine" to "Panic", "But don't worry, everything is fine" to "Panic", instead of an idea of explaining to people "This is spreading, it's scary, this is what we know, our knowledge will evolve, this is what it means in terms of why we need to take measures". I think that probably would have been more helpful than the "go-stop, go-stop" which it sometimes felt like the messaging was around over, I think, probably, concerns of getting back to normality and then, "We have too much normality, we need to stop". So that was a challenge as well.

**Lead 2A**: Just on the subject of :outline:`facemasks`. To summarise, you have said quite a lot about this in your statement, very helpfully.

My understanding of your position is that you were an advocate of the application, in this regard, in these circumstances, I think, of the precautionary principle that it would have been better to have wasted less time on scientific research, trying to get to a level of something near conclusive proof that :outline:`masks` worked and it would have been better simply to have got on with using them, which, as I understand it, you think would have made a difference, in particular, you say in your statement, to the number of deaths that were suffered over that period?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, I think especially in the months before we had scientific tools, that means therapies, vaccines, even, you know, appropriate testing -- that took a long time to get up and going -- these were things that you could recommend to people to limit transmission. They are flawed, I know -- you know, you'll find studies showing that :outline:`masks at a population level` are often not used correctly, people wear them over their mouth not their nose, they take them off to eat and drink, you know, these -- but as a whole, we do know that if it is used appropriately it is probably one of the best interventions you can use to protect yourself. So it would have been another tool.

**Lead 2A**: It would have been effective because we know that about them?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, exactly.

**Lead 2A**: We've seen some evidence on the discussion around :outline:`face masks` in Scotland at this early period that we've been looking at, and we had a gentleman who I think you know called Jim McMenamin, who provided a witness statement, who was describing the discussion in the NERVTAG meetings that he was attending around this period relating to :outline:`face masks`, and he said in his statement that:

"My recollection is that the view during this period, February and March 2020, was that the evidence base on the contribution to reduction in the reproductive number [made] by the public use of :outline:`face coverings` was limited or near non-existent."

Is this the sort of debate and discussion that you think we should have bypassed, going straight to the next stage, by way of the application of the precautionary principle?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Exactly. And it also shows why you need multiple diverse backgrounds in terms of, you know, academic backgrounds. I think modellers in particular can often see things in terms of "I put it into my model and it made no difference" -- and models carry assumptions, I've kind of written about that, and so for me, who is much more an on-the-ground, field-work oriented -- you know I work in low-income communities, you work with health ministries, you know, frontline health workers, that for me is equally valid evidence. And if you're seeing it working in a local level and you're seeing it work in clinical settings, then if a model says it doesn't work you have to reconcile two different evidence sources, and that's triangulation. And that's why you have the debate. And then the precautionary principle comes in, which is: okay, what is the :outline:`cost of recommending masks` versus the potential benefit? And if you think, well, the potential benefit can be huge, the cost is slight recommending them, let's say for those -- you know, going into shops or on transport, then that was the direction you would go in, given the uncertainty between different data sources.

So I think that was where you want to have multiple disciplines at the table who might see things from different perspectives based on their research and their experience in life.

**Lady Hallett**: Professor, can I just interrupt? I remember in Module 1, maybe Module 2, I heard from an expert about there being different views as to what the precautionary principle is. Are there different views as to what it is?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Not that I know of. I think where you might see debate is on what the cost is, of using the precautionary principle. So, for example, you might say we should have used the precautionary principle with lockdown, and that might be debated because lockdown carries huge costs, massive costs, so that may not be appropriate in that setting, where it's generally used for things that you're seeing as being low cost. So, for me, :outline:`recommending masks` seems a low-cost measure of :outline:`something easy, like hand washing`, you can tell people to do.

So probably the debate is in what is the cost of that versus the potential benefit. And that's -- because that's where you draw the line, it's how big is the benefit compared to the cost, projecting into the future, given uncertainty.

**Lady Hallett**: So precautionary principle, virtually no downside -- maybe some downside, but, if you analyse it, not sufficient to not use it?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Exactly.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry about the double negative.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, so if you look at other places in their first wave, governments didn't know what to do, right? They're like, "We're going to have our hospitals collapse, what can we do? We don't have testing. Okay, we can tell people: :outline:`masks`". So the Czech Republic came out and said, "Okay, we don't have testing but, you know what, :outline:`masks for everyone`. Community efforts, :outline:`wear masks`, it's a sign that you can do something". So the benefit was seen as much greater than the cost of recommending it. But I think sometimes it's misapplied for things like lockdown, which I don't think you would use the precautionary principle for because the harms are so great and the costs -- to go down that path.

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, thank you.

**Mr Dawson**: Thank you. I think, Professor, you've also illustrated this as being a very good example of where multidisciplinary input is absolutely essential to these things. I think, to be fair, Professor Woolhouse, in a parliamentary appearance, did say that one of the problems with the UK's pandemic response was that it relied too much on epidemiologists, and he said "I say this as an epidemiologist". And I think you're illustrating there the importance of bringing together different fields of experience (public health, in your sphere, and epidemiology and others) to be able to come to the best solution, and that simply looking at one area may well have its pitfalls. Is that a fair assessment of your view?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Correct. And, you know, Mark and I are a great example, Mark is a modeller, I'm a social scientist, and we have debates. So he'll say to me --

**Lead 2A**: We've come across some of them.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes -- you've come across -- so he'll say to me, "You're cherry-picking, how do you know that? That's not evidence, where are the numbers?" And I'll look at his graphs and say "What is that line? Where did you get it from? Where are the assumptions? That doesn't seem right to me". But I think it makes us both better scientists, I think the group was enriched because we had those debates, and I think there is a great deal of respect between us for the work that, you know, we've each done, and I think it -- that's how a group should work, when there is uncertainty. It's -- you know, can get heated at times, you probably have seen it, but actually I'd rather be in a group like that than a group where we kind of happily go down the wrong path, thinking we're doing great, and then realise that we missed something. And it's a way I construct my own research teams now: I really try to get people who I think will push me and say "That's wrong, why are you doing that?" Because that makes for a better -- a better debate.

And that's where I said I think they were quite smart in that make-up, to have me and Mark there, and you will see the chair soon, who had to moderate between those views.

**Lead 2A**: Yes, we have seen that, yes. But as far as you're concerned, your perspective on that as a participant in that debate, was that that was a healthy debate and in the interests of coming to the best answers and the best advice for the people of Scotland; is that fair?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, definitely, yeah.

**Lead 2A**: Could I just ask a little bit more about your role in advising. As we say, you became a member of the Scottish Covid Advisory Group on 2 April and, along with other public health experts, some of whom worked for agencies like Public Health Scotland, some of whom were external advisers, independent advisers like yourself, and along with a number of other specialities, provided support and advice over the course of the pandemic.

In your book you talk about a closer relationship, a closer advisory relationship you developed with the First Minister?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah.

**Lead 2A**: And you say -- I'm not going to put it up on the screen because you wrote the book so you'll know what's said, but you say:

"I also spoke regularly with Sturgeon offering impartial advice, particularly on what challenges might lie ahead and what best practice from other countries seemed to be at the time. We developed a close working relationship. I was also studying to become a personal fitness trainer and Sturgeon even agreed to become my first client. I should say clearly that she never asked to change what I said publicly. She listened carefully and asked thoughtful questions and tried to understand the best data and evidence. I never felt any political pressure to say what she wanted to hear. She wanted the blunt truth from me and I gave it without fear or favour in my typically American direct way. I have no ambition to go into politics or into government and just wanted to bring what expertise I could to help support her in making extremely difficult leadership decisions."

That's at page 148. And at page 189 you say:

"Sturgeon and I spoke regularly by phone about key issues and were generally aligned on the need to suppress and get cases as low as possible through the summer ..."

Which I think relates to 2020. We'll return to that.

You have provided to the Inquiry, as I should say latterly Ms Sturgeon has done herself, a set of correspondence which comes from direct Twitter messages between you and her which I'd like to go through to some extent after the break, to look at some of the matters that you were discussing with her. But broadly speaking, did you think that -- did it occur to you or was it your view that there were issues about your direct contact with Scotland's principal decision-maker, based on the evidence that you've just given about the need for there to be a multidisciplinary approach, and that your direct access to her, which I think others did not have, created the possibility that she placed a significant amount of weight on your view and less on the weight of others who may hold a slightly different view?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, that's a fair point. I did not know who else she was speaking to. She -- I can probably say she reached out to me for an independent view. I knew she was getting advice from her principal government advisers, you know, the people -- the CMO, you know, the Chief Scientific Adviser, the National Clinical Director, and so when she reached out to me I thought "She just wants an additional view on this". And I think we both shared a deep commitment to finding a good way through this.

And I should also say, you didn't ask me about them from the Inquiry, but I have similar relationships with a number of politicians. I reference, you know, Jeremy Hunt, Layla Moran, Jonathan Ashworth, I work in the States with a number of politicians, Germany, Australia. So it's not unusual, especially during the pandemic, to have direct access to someone senior who just says "Tell me how you see it, what do you think". But I also assumed she was getting many other inputs into that view.

And most importantly, and you'll probably see it in the correspondence, when I said to her at one point I was worried about getting involved with messy politics, should I talk to this person or that person, I'm in over my head a bit, she just said "Just keep what you're saying to whoever it is -- speak to whoever, we'll listen to what you're trying to bring in terms of your data, your evidence, your learnings", and that, I think -- meant a lot, she didn't in any way try to influence what I said. She was -- basically was like -- I said the same thing, I went to the economic recovery group in front of Steve Baker, we had conversations, and he said "What do you think?" and I said the same thing. Wherever I was, it was just who was there. And so I just think it's just worth saying -- saying that there, that I think people emphasised a lot that they felt I was under pressure or I was too friendly with her, and I thought that came out because we got on quite well, but I had similar relationships with a number of senior politicians who -- it was not unusual at that time -- it was a crisis, every day thousands were dying, there was outbreaks, there was fears when schools opened, what's going to happen, and what I was trying to do is saying "Well, we don't know, but in Israel they opened schools, and this is what happened. And no, we don't know what's going to happen with universities, but in the US they opened it and this is what happened", because that was the best we could get to trying to predict the future. We were asked to be oracles, predict the next four months. And you couldn't, but you could say "Well, based on that country and that population, this is what happened". So that's how it -- how it developed.

And I should mention -- I guess we'll go through it -- I never expected them to be public. It was informal, it was private, and everything important in them, as you will see referenced, was put in an email to her and to her office, often copying the CMO or others, because anything of concrete importance, briefs, papers, went through an official route. This was considered an informal, a bit of banter, you know, chat -- chat, kind of informal route. Otherwise I would have obviously written them quite differently to what they are.

**Lead 2A**: Just one aspect of what you said there I just wanted to clarify, just to be absolutely clear, I think you said -- unfortunately the transcript has just gone out of my eye line -- I think you said that she advised you to keep what you're saying to whoever it is. Did you mean that she advised you to keep on saying whatever it was you were saying to people, or to keep what you were saying?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: No, to keep true to that I was saying. So I was a big advocate for maximum suppression, for delaying until a vaccine, to test and trace, and to, you know, finding, you know, safer ways to keep schools open, and her message to me was, you know, "Forget about the politics, you have the data, you have the evidence, your team is working, say it to whoever you need to say it to". And I did. I worked across all political parties, I would say, from the most conservative groups, the economic recovery group, where I sat for a couple hours taking questions, to, you know, the Lib Dems, the Greens, Labour, SNP. So I single out this relationship because of, I guess, how influential it was for me as well, working with a senior leader, but it was not unique, I should also say, to working with politicians at this time.

**Mr Dawson**: Thank you.

If that's a convenient moment, my Lady?

**Lady Hallett**: Just one question before we break.

I'm no expert on the devolution settlement, but you mentioned a couple of times science being a reserved power. Is science --

**Mr Dawson**: I think we went through that with Professor Sridhar. We discussed scientific advisory bodies. There are aspects of science that are reserved, as the professor said. One of the aspects which I think her evidence was was relevant was funding in relation to research, which is important.

You can clarify if that --

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, funding is --

**Lady Hallett**: I think it was just the use of the word "reserved power". I mean, I can see how aspects are reserved.

**Mr Dawson**: Yes, that's what I think we've explored, that, for example, SAGE, of course, was technically a UK Government advisory body. That doesn't mean it was a reserved matter, it sat within the UK Government structures.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much. I shall return at 1.45.

*(12.50 pm)*

*(The short adjournment)*

*(1.45 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Dawson.

**Mr Dawson**: Thank you, my Lady.

Professor, we will get back to the messages that we were talking about in just a movement, but there's a question, just returning to an area we covered earlier, an extra question that I forgot to ask you, if we could return to that.

You were telling us about your views connected to the strategies adopted in the United Kingdom and in Scotland around the early part of pandemic, in particular your views in relation to things that could have been done to enhance the containment strategy that you think were not.

Are you aware of any steps proposed by the Scottish Government for more aggressive strategies in those regards, but which were rejected by the UK Government prior to the first lockdown?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: I'm not aware of that, no.

**Lead 2A**: Just to be fair to you, you were not involved in the advisory group at that stage?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: I was not, no.

**Lead 2A**: But you were, I think -- you had had correspondence, for example, around the middle of March that we've seen with the then Chief Medical Officer, a letter I think written by yourself and some colleagues at Edinburgh University, so you took an interest in the subject?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, so I think that was -- you know, March 12th/13th is when the decision was made to abandon containment, and that's when several colleagues and myself wrote a letter to Dr Calderwood outlining our concerns with that. We didn't receive a response. Several days later we sent an even stronger worded email, with respect to the challenges she was facing, but just not understanding that move and trying to emphasise that we needed to shift at that point. So that was 14th and then 17 March.

**Lead 2A**: I'm not going to take you to the detail of that, Professor, because I think you've set out many, if not all of the points of view and concerns that you expressed in that letter in your evidence already, but there was just that particular one aspect I wanted to follow up on.

If I can return then to the messages that you were telling us about that you shared with the First Minister, I was interested to know about why and when it was that you had produced these messages to the Inquiry. My understanding is that these messages were provided by you in a bundle from -- these are direct Twitter messages, as I understand it. Now, they were produced to the Inquiry on 7 December 2023; is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Around then, yeah, I --

**Lead 2A**: There was, I think, a slight confusion about the messages actually ultimately getting to the Inquiry, but can we put that aside for a moment, that's not a matter for you.

Your witness statement was dated 25 October of this year -- of last year, sorry, and therefore these messages were produced some time later than the statement had been provided. Can you tell the Chair of the Inquiry why it is you produced those messages at that time?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Well, initially I'd been asked about informal communication, specifically WhatsApp groups. I was not part of any WhatsApp groups and I went through the channel the Scottish Government had for informal communications, which was Slack and then Teams, and Zoom messages, which I assumed had been held. And it was only a bit later, when watching the proceedings happening, that I was thinking "Is there anything else?" and I hadn't been asked about Twitter at all till that point -- I'm very active on Twitter -- and was thinking "Could those be?" because in the questions I'd got were specifically questions around my communication with the former First Minister, zooming in on that.

And I so approached the Scottish Government and said "Would these be relevant to the Inquiry?" and they said "Yes, they would be". And then I had to figure out how to download them, because you can't download Twitter DMs, you have to screenshot it. So it took me -- I had to do all those. And then I did send them immediately over, and hopefully in time for this.

It was not meant to hide anything, it was just I didn't -- I didn't think of it because it wasn't asked of me, and WhatsApps were focused on and I wasn't part of any of those groups.

**Lead 2A**: So was -- the production of the messages was on your own initiative and not instigated by anyone else?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: It was me thinking "Is there anything else that's relevant related to this?"

I have to also admit that I had forgotten about them. If you see, the last one was dated I think 2020, if I'm in there, and there was -- two years ago. So I didn't even really fully understand it was in there, I had to search and then go find those back there.

**Lead 2A**: Thank you for that.

Just to clarify, you mentioned the use of a particular medium for communication there which was called Slack.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah.

**Lead 2A**: Some of the information that we have indicates that a number of the academics like yourself, members of the Covid-19 Advisory Group, would communicate up-to-date scientific information and views on that through Slack. Is that a correct interpretation of the way in which that particular platform was used?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, I think it was introduced because we had too much email traffic. So people wanted to share a new research paper and it was clogging people's inboxes, there was just so many emails. And so the view was made that if you wanted to share things, share it on Slack, to try to avoid the email traffic for -- you know, when you wanted to post a link to something or a thought or they wanted feedback on something. So it was to try to make it more coherent, I guess.

**Lead 2A**: Did that discussion simply involve the academics or was that a forum on which discussions also involved senior officials within the Scottish Government and/or ministers?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: I don't know exactly who was invited to it, it was like a link to an app that you go into. I think definitely everyone on the Scottish Government advisory group was on it, so that would include probably the CMO, the National Clinical Director. I can't remember seeing any ministerial posts but I don't know who was invited onto that channel. It's kind of like a -- I don't know if you've used it before, it's like a website where you kind of just post stuff to, and people who click that link to that work space can go in and see it. So I don't know who else had access to that work space, if that makes sense, I would just go on and kind of read what was posted and then respond if I felt I had something useful to say.

**Lead 2A**: In terms of your broad recollection of how that was used, the active traffic was discussion amongst the academics rather than involvement of Scottish Government officials or ministers?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, it was active discussion around papers, ideas, yes, and it was -- because it was kind of a group mechanism, I think it was probably 100% work-related, it was used like that for that purpose.

**Lead 2A**: Indeed, thank you.

Could I then look at INQ000398982. This is the bundle of WhatsApp -- sorry, Twitter direct messages that you've just referred to that you provided to the Scottish Government initially, near the beginning of December, and subsequently came to the Inquiry. Is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, yep.

**Lead 2A**: Is this all of the messages that you have retained between yourself and the former First Minister, either on this platform or on any electronic platform?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, we also had emails, but I've submit those emails as well to the Inquiry.

**Lead 2A**: So just to be clear --

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: We did not WhatsApp, if that's --

**Lead 2A**: Insofar as you mentioned earlier, and I think one can see from the body of these messages, that you refer sometimes to policy papers which you are informing the former First Minister you have contributed to or you have prepared yourself or with your team and you wish to bring them to her attention for some reason, and is your position from your earlier evidence that, as regards those policy papers, those were always submitted by other channels through email to the Scottish Government; is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, yes, yeah.

**Lead 2A**: But as regards any other conversations, those were not submitted -- the content of those conversations was simply limited to the Twitter direct message exchange?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, and phone conversations as well, because we would often speak by phone about different issues.

So, yeah, it was -- this was kind of like the sharing of me trying to highlight, like, "Paper going in on this or that", her saying "Yes, send it to my email", going into the email, saying "Bit worried about that", and then the phone conversations would supplement it if it felt like there was further expansion needed on a policy paper to understand it fully.

**Lead 2A**: Right.

So the messages that you provided, you helpfully provided here, are dated between 16 May 2020 and 17 December 2020. Is that the period over which you had direct contact with the First Minister or was there a longer period over which you had contact with her, connected to the pandemic response?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: So there was contact before this, as she said, through the advisory group, we had deep dives where we would meet ministers, including herself, to explain evidence. I think you'll have the dates for those, so I had contact with her through that. And then after this December is when the vaccine started to roll out, so actually, though there was challenges going into 2021, it didn't feel as acute and as dire as 2020 did, and so you'll probably see also the email traffic basically petered out, because -- at that point, because we were moving to a post-vaccine world, and the challenge there was around getting vaccines out, getting uptake, new variants, and so our communication wasn't as relevant in that point, so no, we didn't -- I mean, we kept in touch, I guess, by phone, but it wasn't the same level of intensity, as the emails also show.

**Lead 2A**: I'm just interested obviously on the extent to which you're communicating about the Covid response, not about anything else.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah.

**Lead 2A**: So did the contact between you and her continue after that period as far as you talking about the pandemic response is concerned.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: No.

**Lead 2A**: No. So this is the period that we need to be focused on if one were to wish to know what it was you were discussing?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: This series of messages we think is helpful in highlighting a number of the important events that were happening over this period. This is a particularly important period, as it happens, when lots of things were happening and lots of decisions needed to be taken in which we are interested, so following the messages through is an interesting way, I think, of trying to elucidate some of the positions that were being taken and some of the decisions that were being taken too.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah.

**Lead 2A**: So we can see the messages start on 16 May. If we go over the page, this is an exchange between you and her. You referred on the first page to the advisory group though which you had had the previous contact at deep dive meetings attended by the First Minister, which you already told us about. You give her your mobile phone number in order to offer her support in connection with the response; is that correct?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yep.

**Lead 2A**: Just to be clear, you didn't exchange any other messages with her, although she had your phone number, by any other media, for example text messages, WhatsApp.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Nothing that pertained at this point -- would be relevant to here. We had -- I mean, I'm trying to think -- we were not on WhatsApp groups, so -- and we do not have any direct one-to-one on WhatsApp, but I would say all of our communication relevant to the pandemic was through here, email, phone conversations and then the deep dives. So we had kind of four different channels to do it on. And, yeah, I don't think even till today I've had a WhatsApp conversation with her.

**Lead 2A**: Just to be clear -- as you'd exchanged numbers. As regards the telephone conversations which you've explained as sometimes being around the content being discussed here, were, as far as you were aware, records of those telephone conversations ever retained?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: They were not retained on my end, they were just -- they felt to me quite -- not quite casual but it's, say, "Okay, you've sent this paper in", and then the questioning around the evidence behind it, why I thought certain things were true. Yeah. And -- and sometimes, and this is where the comment around the personal trainer came in, about mental health and about "How are you coping? This is really difficult". And that's when I talked about exercise, so that's why that came in. Yeah, I think it was really just an expansion on papers to try to understand. I think she really wanted to understand the evidence and the data and what other countries were doing, and if Scotland could learn from those countries to do something better. So a lot of the questions were around who is doing this well, "Who do you think is testing well?" So I remember talking a lot about Denmark, because they were testing four times as much per capita as Scotland and managing to keep schools open.

So that was kind of the tone of the conversations.

**Lead 2A**: Thank you.

As regards the personal trainer comment, just to clarify that, did the personal training aspect of things mean that you had contact with the former First Minister either in person or via Zoom or whatever for that purpose?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: No. So I should say I've only met her twice in person. Both have been in formal meetings that have logged in government buildings. It was -- I mean, in my book it was a throwaway comment because we had a conversation about how stressful it was, and I asked her "Are you getting exercise?" Which is a weird thing to ask but I was just saying "How are you coping?" and -- because that's how I coped, it was exercise, and I said I was doing my PT certification. She joked she needed to do more exercise and I'd said "You can be my first client, it will help me build my base". And so that was the tenor of it, right? It was a joke which I put in. Nothing has come it, I haven't had any sessions with her in the park or anything like that. That was the context.

**Lead 2A**: Thank you for clarifying that. We may actually return to discuss a little later some of the stresses on all of those who were involved.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: It's a subject I'd like to look into with you as well.

On page 3, please, you see on 17 May that you mention a few recent articles where your words have been twisted, you find it frustrating. She reassures you and says:

"I fully understand how the media can twist words, sometimes deliberately. I think what you say is very powerful and clear though, and has had a big influence on my thinking."

So this is the First Minister indicating to you -- she's giving you some reassurance, but also indicating that the views that you have expressed through various media -- you were on TV, you wrote an article regularly in The Guardian and in other newspapers I think sometimes, and of course through the formal channels that you've mentioned, the deep dive meetings and everything -- had been influential in her thinking?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yep.

**Lead 2A**: And --

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, and I have to say on that it was a challenge, because I did lots of interviews and I did it with the best of intentions of trying to share information, let people know what was happening, and sometimes you got it reported straight and sometimes what you said got convoluted into another message, and it became really tricky because you're trying to -- I was trying to be on an advisory group, stay in the room, stay involved, at the same time trying to do media work, and it was often a very impossible balance to have both in a way.

**Lead 2A**: Thank you. That's a theme which is recurrent in these messages, I think, that you are almost apologetic at times about the fact that you had tried to convey a particular message and it perhaps didn't come across exactly the way you had intended; would that be fair?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, and I'm -- I mean, I admit I was quite naive on that. So you could give an interview for 20 minutes and explain things in great complexities, as academics can do, and then something will get pulled out and become the headline, and then when she would go into a media briefing they would say "So and so has said this", which would sound ridiculous in that context, and I was like "No, that was in the context of a 20-minute discussion".

So I did struggle, which we can come to, I guess, later on, with how do you engage with the media as an independent expert, where you're trying to convey messages -- and we'll come to schools, where I thought we were very aligned on schools and what we were trying to do with schools, but often the media would try to say, oh, she's being pressured into saying this or she's saying that. And it was hard. And I say "media" because there's -- there's all kinds of journalists and I think some are -- are looking to really try to get to the core of what you're saying and some are trying to create a headline. Which will, you know, make it difficult, in a sense, to keep relationships, where you're trying to say "I'm -- we're all on the same team here, we're trying to get through this pandemic, we're not trying to fight each other".

**Lead 2A**: Can I, as I've tried to do with other witnesses, try to contextualise this particular period, just so those who are listening are aware of what was going on at this time.

In Scotland by this time, we had had the month before the framework, the four harms framework, set out as Scottish Government's strategy towards dealing with the pandemic and eventually coming out of a lockdown; is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, on 17 May, yeah, we were beginning to emerge.

**Lead 2A**: That had been in the recent past. And in May one of the major things that happened was that the Scottish Government had set out its route map, which built on the four harms document, to try and exit lockdown.

Is that, broadly speaking, your recollection of where we were at this time?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, broadly --

**Lead 2A**: Yes.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: -- I mean, you know, I haven't looked back to what --

**Lead 2A**: Yes.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: -- I don't even know what I was referring to here, but I'm guessing it's that time period, yeah.

**Lead 2A**: So you discuss -- we're looking at page 4 here. You're discussing here with her, you say:

"Thanks for your leadership, just to note that small room to manoeuvre, estimated 1,000 to 2,500 daily new cases, sobering to see those figures after many weeks of lockdown, and while outdoor activities generally feels safe, it feels like public sees this as lockdown lifted and all that comes with, outdoor activities, transport food, toilets can increase transmission, fragile situation ahead."

To which the First Minister responds:

"Yes, I agree and feel very anxious about it. We will continue to be very tough in our messaging and won't be going any further than this for now."

Over the page:

"I've been worried for the last couple of weeks that public already ahead of us on outdoor activity, and so formally allowing some of it at least enables us to try to put some 'rules' around it on transport, distancing etc that many will follow. But, yes, fragile. Many thanks for your continued advice."

And you say:

"Yes, I can understand that, as much as Scotland can chart its own course & develop its own testing, tracing and local data systems & public health response, the better. England is going a dangerous path on Monday with even its science advisors speaking out now."

I wonder if you can help us contextualise where we are here a little, in the sense that you are -- there is a degree of caution, I think, on both of your parts at this time, this seems to be quite a pivotal moment; is that correct?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, of course. I mean, we were facing, if you remember, at the time, across Britain, thousands of deaths a day, healthcare workers were at, you know, burning out point, and it felt like England was just trying to lift very quickly without having the structures in place to make sure you could still suppress, and so it was worrying, and I probably have said the exact same to -- down south to people in England as well.

**Lead 2A**: So your perception of -- we've heard other evidence about what was going on in the UK Government and what subsequently happened in Scotland at this stage, but your perception here was that your view was that the path that England was about to go down was the wrong path, and that you mention here that Scotland had its own powers to have certain systems within its control. Was your intent here to try and convey the message that Scotland needed to proceed more cautiously than the English plan had set out?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: Thank you.

If I could just go over the page, there's some discussion -- this is on page 6 -- there's some discussion there at the top. This is on 4 June, so slightly later, another exchange:

"I've done a note for the CMO we're discussing in our Scottish group ..."

That would be the Covid Advisory Group that we've referred to?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yep.

**Lead 2A**: "... on key steps to managing outbreak in Scotland looking forward, happy to share a draft, don't want to overstep or break protocol."

What was your concern there?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: I didn't want to be seen as overstepping in terms of actually sharing an actual policy document. I mean, in some ways actually, if you read through it, the public communications I was doing seemed to be more influential on her thinking than what I was saying in the policy documents. But yeah, I just -- I mean, in some ways I am new to how things are run here and I didn't want to be seen as breaking some kind of rule and being, like, "No, no, you shouldn't do that", so that was why I --

**Lead 2A**: Yes, yes, of course.

To which she says:

"That'd be very helpful, don't worry about protocol, tackling the virus more important than that and I'll handle any issues on that front. You can send it to me privately at ..."

And she provides two addresses, one of which is an SNP address; is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yep.

**Lead 2A**: Which of the addresses would you use when corresponding with her by email in the way that you had said?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: I would say guess both, hopefully. I don't remember, I'd probably use one or the other. My sense anyways was both were being read by everybody. I mean, the notes I sent in were circulated, I think, among the top team, so they were not -- I don't -- I didn't think of them as private documents. I saw them as, once you email to that kind of address -- I'm sending it from my university email, which is a public document as well. Yeah, so I can't recall, but I wouldn't have made a distinction trying to think: oh, that's a private route, that's a public route. I would have --

**Lead 2A**: Yes.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: -- just sent it.

**Lead 2A**: Yes. You didn't know any different between one address and the other, and there's no -- she's giving you either to use?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah.

**Lead 2A**: I understand.

So over the page, please, page 7, just the end of that message you see it says:

"Either way fine by me."

Which I think is indicating either email address would be fine; is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yep, yep.

**Lead 2A**: "And also for future use if necessary you can contact me directly."

And I think she provides there her personal mobile phone number; is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yep.

**Lead 2A**: "Feel free to do so if you think there's anything I'm not aware of or not adequately taking account of or just getting wrong. I'm extremely anxious about the fragility of the position just now, so very grateful for any advice. Many thanks."

So there the former First Minister is encouraging you to get in personal contact with her to assist with the pandemic response, in particular in light of the fact that she, like you, sees this as a pivotal moment?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah.

**Lead 2A**: Thank you.

If I could go to page 12, please. I should say, Professor, I am picking messages here which I think are of significance to the scope that we are looking at and some important exchanges. If there are any other aspects of this which you feel we should be looking at -- I'm not in any way seeking to exclude any of the messages at all -- I'd happily look at any of them, but I'm doing it for that purpose, to try and focus on things that are important to the way that we are analysing matters.

If we go to page 12 of the document, please, you say -- this is now 18 June, and you say there that you're working with a couple of other senior public health experts in Scotland on an "exciting and feasible plan for elimination in July, will forward on as soon as it's ready", and then Ms Sturgeon says:

"We'll be very keen to see that, thanks."

Now, as you might anticipate, what I'm interested in in that regard is: this is an early mention of the word "elimination". We have talked with other witnesses about the extent to which, at around this time or slightly later, Scotland adopted a policy of what is sometimes called elimination, sometimes called zero Covid, and I'm interested in understanding what your role was in that.

Broadly speaking, is it fair to say that you were keen on pursuing elimination?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah. Can I explain the logic at the time?

**Lead 2A**: Absolutely, please do.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Okay.

So we're in summer 2020, this is June, we've just been through months of very harsh lockdown to get numbers down and we have -- are starting to see a move from community transmission to clusters to isolated cases, with handful of cases out there. In July, going forward from this, we had no deaths from Covid for two weeks, we were facing days of testing, finding four, five cases, six cases. Alongside this, we had antibody studies released around then which showed that roughly 5% of the Scottish population had been exposed, in the cities. So in rural communities, island communities, that's probably 2 or 3%.

So we've already faced a huge death wave, a harsh lockdown, we faced the prospect if numbers go up of a large susceptible population, most people have not had Covid, and we also know by this time vaccines are on the way. The UK Government is contracting with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Sanofi, I can go through them, there's about eight contracts out, and these vaccines are showing promising results. By that point we had promising results in animal trials, I think phase 1 had been finished, we were into phase 2.

And so in my mind, and along with colleagues, was we could have a vaccine within months and that could save thousands of lives, and we are so close to actually being able to eliminate this. And to be fair, my colleague Dr Kenny Baillie at the university did genetic sequencing studies and showed the first strains were eliminated, like, we did it in Scotland. The problem is we re-imported new strains, and so that's why the note we did said -- and this is maybe a mistake I made using the word "elimination". If I had used "maximum suppression", we probably would have gotten alignment. If I hadn't said "zero Covid" -- because I understood zero Covid as how we talk about, in global health, vision zero. Sweden's approach to road traffic deaths, stop TB, end malaria, zero -- you know, stop TB. We use these titles and campaigns to say we don't accept a spread of this disease, we try to deal with it and reduce it.

And so that was what I was trying to convey, it was saying that we have a chance here to hold and wait for a vaccine in an optimal position and actually have a payoff from the sacrifices made and avoid a winter lockdown, which is what we were facing, it was clear, if numbers went up, there was enough people susceptible, we would repeat that same mistake we had in the first wave.

And I know it's been heavily criticised, people say it was, you know, blue skies, but the truth is for me elimination was elimination strategy, how do we drive to zero, and I have to say at that time the debate in England was about an acceptable number of cases and staying within NHS capacity, let's just kind of float cases, and that seemed to be egregious given we had a vaccine around the corner.

And I will say, looking forward, because I've been involved in that for lessons learned, that I don't think anyone is talking about living with avian flu or living with whatever it might be next, a MERS outbreak. The whole focus now is what's called the "100 days challenge", it's within 100 days that you have a vaccine, a treatment or some kind of therapeutic.

In the United States that's been translated into 130 days till the entire US population is vaccinated and 200 days till the world is vaccinated, that's where the US Government planning's going.

And so in that 100 days, nobody is saying we should accept spread; they're saying: maximum suppression, we need to hold.

So I understood when Covid emerged there was debates over: will there be a vaccine? That maybe at that point you could have accepted spread, you could have said it's inevitable, that's -- it's a disease and it's gone. But to accept it when you knew vaccines were around the horizon, you knew the deaths that entailed, and I worked on schools -- we can come to that -- very closely, you knew that we had to get kids back to school, keep them in school, and that meant keeping Covid at a low level.

It felt like this was the time to push for it and it seemed feasible. And if you read the elimination plan I put together -- which I've submit and went through the advisory group -- it wasn't saying lockdown, it didn't even mention the word "lockdown", what it mentioned was extensive testing, we had a lot of unused testing capacity in Scotland, so I was like: we should be testing much more.

It mentioned borders and imported cases and travel and tourism and worries about the return of the university, and it mentioned cohesion across the four nations and actually getting England to come along with this plan, which was the main area at that point.

So I think when people say, oh, this caused indefinite lockdown or this caused harms, that wasn't -- were saying, it was trying to capitalise on all that we had done to get to such a good position, and that's why when the winter wave came and the winter lockdown and the numbers went up, it was predictable and it was really depressing because in January vaccines rolled out and you think: how many of those people would have lived, had they just been able to delay infection by two months, a month? That was how close it was at that time.

**Lead 2A**: So your position -- thank you for that. Could I make another -- repeat my plea on behalf of the stenographer?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Oh, slowly.

**Lead 2A**: And also, frankly, on my capacity to take in what you're saying. But if you could just speak a little more slowly, we'd very much appreciate that.

So your position at this time was that zero Covid or elimination was the goal, and you thought it was achievable, and I think you said that your colleague has demonstrated that, as far as the original strains were concerned, Covid -- the original strains were eliminated, so Scotland did achieve zero Covid by that standard?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: There is, I think, a potential issue around the question of the language used of "elimination" and "zero Covid", in particular the way in which that is released to the public, and what that -- the perception of that might be.

Is it -- do you think it's fair that -- well, first of all, did you understand it to be the policy of the Scottish Government at this time to aim for zero Covid or elimination?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Not in their -- what they were actually doing, no. Right? Because we didn't have any checks on cases coming over, we had no cohesion with England on a plan, and so I think it was -- it was nice to have this message to say: as low as possible, let's push incidence down. I don't think anyone would ever say publicly we adopted a zero Covid plan. And I have to say that was a mistake, and I'll hold my hands up. I think whenever I said "zero Covid", people would say, "Zero cases of Covid?" and I said, "No, we're trying to reach a world of zero Covid", like we try to reach a world of zero cancer or zero road traffic incidents, and saying we don't accept and live with diseases and causes of death, we try to reduce them.

Elimination as well, because people would say "Elimination is impossible", and I'd say, "Okay, it's an elimination strategy", and they wouldn't understand that, so I'd say, "Okay, maximum suppression".

So if you read through these, you could see I changed my language to -- we're all talking about the same thing, it's just different language, and I would have said "maximum suppression", which is: get those cases down and communicate to the public that we are doing this because vaccines are on their way in a matter of months, and that's the messaging I tried to do as well to people: postpone Christmas by a month, you'll have many more Christmases in the future. But it didn't come across, I know, in that language.

**Lead 2A**: So ultimately zero Covid or elimination was a target, an aspiration, and even if it were not achieved, if efforts were made towards it, it would achieve suppression of cases and the virus, which could only be a good thing?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, shoot for the stars. Right? And you try to get -- you save as many lives as you can. And to be fair, the countries that have come out well in terms of their excess mortality, as well as their stringency index, as well as their economies, did go for maximum suppression, which I'm saying why in the future going forward, the template that governments are using, including Britain, is this hundred-day plan, which is: we assume in 100 days we will have some kind of breakthrough, we're preparing MRNA platforms, diagnostics, you know, we have so many ways to create tools. And then the question becomes: what do you do in those 100 days, and how do you avoid the loss of freedom, the loss of livelihood, school closures in those 100 days until you have a product?

So this was, I guess, my attempt at trying to bring this into the discussion. And I wasn't alone, to be fair, I mean, there were colleagues across the world who were also saying "You're not a Dakar, you're not a Seoul, you are Scotland, you're 5.5 million people, your biggest city has 600,000". In the context of the world we are a small country, we are a high-income country, we have good economic security nets. So in global health we are in a privileged position.

So that's the way I was seeing it, though I can see it was not a long-term plan to say "no more Covid forever", it was: let's reduce Covid until we can roll out a scientific breakthrough.

**Lead 2A**: Could we look at the statement, please, at paragraph 142, just to jump away from this at the moment.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yep.

**Lead 2A**: Page 23. Do you tell us there, around about this time, slightly after the message you were looking at:

"On 30 June 2020 I was quoted in an article titled 'Scotland could eliminate coronavirus if it were not for England' ... In this article I offeredmy opinion that there seemed to be two different approached to managing Covid-19 in England and Scotland. The Scottish strategy seemed to aim for maximum suppression while keeping cases of Covid-19 at really low levels. England's approach appeared to be to keep Covid-19 within NHS capacity and try to get back to normality as soon as possible. In other words, Scotland was looking to suppress Covid-19 until a vaccine was available, while England seemed to be focused on how to live with Covid-19 before mass vaccination."

You mentioned a moment ago the difficulties there were in achieving consensus.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah.

**Lead 2A**: Did you think that this article and your contribution to it helped in that process?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: No, it didn't, but I should say that when you talk to journalists you don't know what actually the title's going to be, you don't know what you're going to be quoted on, you don't know what's going to be in it, and if you actually take away the title -- and I went back to read the article -- I actually was emphasising that we needed to have cohesion across the approaches. And if I'm honest, I was really frustrated with not understanding England's strategy because we are linked together. And so it does seem to me so clear that, given the levels of immunity, given the level of death, given that we didn't want to have another lockdown which was catastrophic in terms of, you know, the harms that raised, why you wouldn't go for maximum suppression and just try to kind of simmer Covid within a level. It just doesn't work when you have such a large susceptible population.

So, yeah, I mean, you could make a whole book about all my missteps with journalists and articles and media coverage, but I guess the point was being: we didn't have consensus and I really felt we should have consensus, because it seemed clear to me what should be the steps going forward and -- yeah.

**Lead 2A**: I think the messages show, without going through them all individually -- please tell me if I've got the wrong impression -- that one of the subjects you discuss regularly, although the messages are relatively irregular, with Ms Sturgeon is the very fact of the difficulty arriving at some sort of consensus. Even putting some sort of four nation effort into a slogan as to what we're trying to achieve seemed to take months. So you were aware that there was no consensus, and indeed your interpretation of your contribution to the article indicates that you were aware of it.

As a result of that, was it not your assessment that it was inevitable that zero Covid, understood in the sense of there being no Covid at all, was unachievable in light of the lack of consensus?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: Therefore does that mean that if people were -- do you think it was reasonable that people took the impression, when "zero Covid" or "elimination" appeared in the media, that what Scottish people thought was that that meant that Covid is going to be over soon?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Maybe. I don't know how it's interpreted. It wasn't -- maybe we should have communicated it better, that we're trying to suppress until a vaccine, and I think if we had -- hopefully not in our lifetimes but a future pandemic, that that is the language that you'd give. You'd say -- imagine avian flu starts human-to-human transmission, you would say to people, "We are trying to keep this at very low levels, it's very deadly, until we have a scientific breakthrough which protects you from this", and maybe that should have been the language in the summer.

I think we got there in November, if I remember, then the messaging was around "The vaccines are coming, hold out". But it was -- it was very difficult in that period because the messaging was: get back to the office, get back to normality, you know, Eat Out to Help Out, you know, all these things which tried to give people a sense of, you know, the problem is over, where I was actually trying to say the problem is coming this winter. I mean, that was the worry, a winter lockdown, which is what we were trying to avoid, and a winter lockdown would be triggered by the NHS getting overwhelmed. The NHS gets overwhelmed if you have too many people infected with Covid, and too many people get infected with Covid if you have no testing in place and people mix and you have a susceptible population. So it was just a logical kind of backstep of: how do we avoid this, working backwards.

And so ... yeah, and I think in terms of learning lessons, we should be learning not only in terms of the lives lost but how we avoid those kind of lockdown measures, and that was -- part of my learning is, like, how do we do both? And, okay, this is a way we can maybe do both for the next couple of months.

**Lead 2A**: In circumstances where, if it were to be the case that people in Scotland thought that that message meant that Covid was over, was about to be over, do you think that it was predictable, if people thought that, that people might think to ourselves: let's go out to the pub, let's go to the restaurant, let's book that Spanish holiday?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, that might have been an unintended consequence. I don't -- I mean, obviously it was not what I intended or wanted to happen. I think it was the idea of: we have a window of time where we can contain and have a breakthrough. And if you go back to that letter that I wrote with colleagues to Dr Calderwood in March, we do mention vaccines. We say in that the first trials have started. I'd worked before that with CEPI, with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. There were about 200 trials that started in January and by, you know, April it looked pretty good. I mean, by that summer Sarah Gilbert, you know, one of the people who created the Oxford vaccine, was saying 80% effectiveness. So for me that was like, oh my goodness, we're going to have not one but multiple vaccines. Sputnik, the Russian vaccine, was approved, you know, quite soon after that summer.

So I think that's where it was really coming from, and everything, it was that: we have a chance for a scientific breakthrough, and we've done this. Humans are remarkable at finding scientific solutions, whether it's HIV, measles, malaria, polio, smallpox. You can go through the range of things we faced, we have found some way to defang them or make them less deadly. And so when we knew that was around the horizon, to try to get back to normality seemed to me wrong.

But then you're saying, I guess, zero Covid might've prompted people to get back to normality, so it was an unintended consequence if that was what happened. I would never have wanted that, clearly.

**Lead 2A**: Because we do know, at least as regards my reference to the Spanish holiday, that the second wave was predominantly caused in Scotland, if not exclusively caused, by people who took holidays in particular to continental Europe and Spain because genomic sequencing has shown that the variants that then became the drivers for the second wave were ones that originated in continental Europe; isn't that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, and I mean, I did do a New York Times piece that summer saying "We're going to pay for our summer holidays with winter lockdowns", it's exactly the title of the piece, and the point being that: what could we do about it, though, right? So you're thinking: okay, we could've tested. I think that the main challenge, I think, is we didn't accept there were trade-offs. There were trade-offs in a pandemic to try to save lives. Some countries traded off privacy, that was South Korea with their testing and tracing; some traded off international mobility through closing their borders; some traded off -- you know, you could go through it. And it felt like here people wanted everything and they were angry that they didn't have everything. And so my point is, again, if you have to put brakes in the system to slow this, where would you put the brakes? You don't want to put them into schools, kids need to be in school. You don't want to put it into even people's livelihoods, you know, pubs, daily life, that's the bulk of the economy, consumers, I mean ...

So I thought, well, where would you put the brakes in? It's airports and travel and borders, which is why I was talking about that issue, because I thought: yes, there's reduced international mobility, but there's reduced international mobility anyways because everyone's stopped travelling, so the airlines are anyways hurting. Put in place testing regimes, and they were asking for that as well. I mean, the air -- I did -- you probably have the evidence from the Parliament committee I did on travel, and actually airports and airlines were asking for testing regimes, for more kind of alignment across countries about travel.

And so that's a real shame, looking back, to think we had that window of opportunity and we didn't act on it, a way to avoid a winter lockdown. I just thought: wouldn't you rather have kids in school, be able to go about your daily life and have all that, but if you want to go abroad it's a bit more difficult for a few months, rather than have what we had, which is kind of like the NHS at breakpoint, health workers burning out, thousands of people dying, and you end up in a stay-at-home lockdown? It's like the whole system collapses if you didn't make that choice early on, so that was kind of the logic, at least my thinking, going into it.

**Lead 2A**: Thank you.

There isn't a lot of discussion around this time and it goes -- the messages go on along this vein, you're pushing your view of maximum suppression or elimination, whatever you call it, and is it fair to say that that was a message to which the former First Minister was very receptive?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: She --

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: She could see the logic.

**Lead 2A**: Yes.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: I mean, I laid it out as logically as I've tried to here, and we all wanted the same things, and I do believe she did want the best for the -- for as much as she could control for the Scottish and the British public of trying --

**Lead 2A**: Yes.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: No one wanted to see the deaths.

**Lead 2A**: You mention "as much as she could control"; there isn't in these exchanges, from what I can see, trying to read it as fairly as possible, an awful lot of discussion about borders. You've mentioned the fact that borders might well have been something or would have been something you should have done if you were pursuing a maximum suppression strategy, and that that didn't happen, and I think we're agreed on the fact that that was the major contributor to the second wave, which is precisely what you were trying to avoid.

Why is it the case that you weren't saying very much in these messages about borders? Was it because you understood that was not within the First Minister's control?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Well, that's what I understood, and also we had a land border, so people would just fly into Manchester and Newcastle. I mean, the idea that, you know -- we've already seen -- I talk about this with the whole red list. If someone is flying, for example, into the States from China, they couldn't fly. This is what former president Donald Trump did. What they would do, they would just connect in Europe and they'd fly from London, then they're not flying from China.

And so I guess the point being that without England coming along and saying, "Oh, actually, yeah, we like this plan, let's do it for the whole island, as a whole", it would be impossible just to -- if you just limited Edinburgh, Glasgow, you know, the major airports here, all you do is drive traffic into England and people would just take the train up.

So that was, I guess, the logic, but if you look at the actual elimination document that I mentioned, we do mention borders quite -- there. And I did mention it so much that I was called xenophobic at points, and so I think if anything I probably overstated the case, and I was saying it's not xenophobia. I mean, who am I to be xenophobic? I'm a foreigner in another country. It was more the point that: where do you put brakes in the system to slow and delay spread in the least harmful way? And for me the airlines were anyway suffering, I don't think many people were travelling, they were trying to stay home and stay safe. So how do we go into autumn in the best position possible, and schools, in my mind, very, very apparently, that we wanted to keep schools open, which meant we had to have levels of infection quite low.

**Lead 2A**: Should the Scottish Government have done more over this period to try to work towards your goal of maximum suppression?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, I would say, I mean, I think in the messages with the former First Minister you can see she was aligned on it and she was trying to push it, from what she says in those messages with COBR, with those down south. I was trying to push it down south, I had meetings with Patrick Vallance, I wrote Chris Whitty, I went in front of the COVID Recovery Group and made the case as well for why I thought this was the best for economic recovery for the country. So I think in a sense I did what I thought I could do to try to advocate this and put the logic forward, but I don't know where it went once it goes into that system. I brought it up in the Covid Advisory Group multiple times where it was debated, and ... yeah, I don't -- maybe that is a lesson, if you think I should've done something more I can learn from that, but I felt I did what I could to kind of get the message and the information, the data out into the system and then you kind of have to let it go because that's in the end a political decision that's beyond me.

**Lead 2A**: As far as the Scottish Government's actions are concerned, am I correct in understanding your evidence that one(?) should in your view have done more is done more as regards the border, the external border, if it was competent for it to do so, and done more testing over this period; is that right?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, and --

**Lead 2A**: Are there any other things in the strategy that it should and could have done to try to pursue that strategy more than it did?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: I think we needed to have more cohesion with England. I don't think it makes sense to have us going in such divergent approaches. We needed to have some kind of consensus that we're all going forwards the same goal, at least, in the same kind of -- on the same timeframe.

**Lead 2A**: Yes.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: So that I think was a challenge.

**Lead 2A**: Thank you.

To move away from the messages and this for one moment, there's one other area I'd like to cover with you. In both your book and your statement -- it's at paragraph 186 -- you explain some of the experiences that you had in your role as a public figure who provided media in relation to the Covid response but also your role as an independent expert adviser, and in the book and in the statement -- in the statement you say, paragraph 186:

"... I am passionate about my work in global public health and I felt I had the correct expertise to contribute to a more effective response. However, it did come at a major cost. All members of the Group contributed a significant amount of time on a pro bono basis. I also have been subject to public abuse, death threats and online conspiracy theories."

I was interested to try to understand what those experiences must have been like, in particular in the context of the responsibility of this Inquiry to try to consider recommendations as to how to encourage people like yourself to be part of advisory groups on a pro bono basis, as you were, to try to maximise the efficiency of any response to a future pandemic.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yeah, it's a really -- it's a tricky area. I've thought about it a lot, I reflect on it in my book. Because I got involved because it was literally about life and death. I got on to the media at a time when I felt that people were confused, they didn't know what to believe, and I knew what experts were doing. Experts were moving their families to remote islands, they were moving to country homes, and they were pulling their children out of school, and they were protecting themselves and their loved ones, yet that message wasn't reaching the public. It seemed to be this divide between what -- not just here, around the world -- experts were doing to prepare and what the general public knew, with governments underplaying it.

And so, yeah, I stepped up and I tried to provide honest information to the public on the risks, on what we knew about it, on what other countries were doing. I tried not to be alarming, I tried to be always factual, but I felt they deserved the same information that we had and the same chances of protecting their loved ones.

And it's not -- I should say at the time that people did think this was something just about the elderly and it wasn't. I mean, in the United States a quarter of the people who have died are under 65. I have had people my age die in India because they couldn't get to hospital to get fluids and oxygen. This is a serious disease, and I felt like that was why I put myself out there. And it has been rough, I have -- I won't go into it too much, but I have gotten death threats, I've had racism, sexism, homophobia, you name it, xenophobia, and I've taken it because I think the bigger idea is that we try to help each other and do good, and I stay true to that.

But it's not about me any more, because I lead a team of researchers at the university, post docs, PhDs, master's, about 75% are young women, they don't want to go near government service or the media, they've seen too much. And it makes me sad because I've done my tour of duty, I've done my service, my book ends by saying, you know, I'm on to my next things, but who's going to step up next time? And I don't think, seeing how it's gone, that others will be willing to do it, because the cost is high and the benefits are low.

Academia is orientated around the grants you bring in, your research income, your teaching and your publications, what are your citations? That is how you get promoted, that is how you make your career. Sitting on government panels is seen as, you know, great that you've done it; media work is completely seen as irrelevant, I would say. And so why would you do it, given the costs involved?

I did it because we were in a pandemic and people were dying and I just thought it was too important not to speak up. My sister also works on a Covid ward in New York City, she had seen everything before, you know, we were hit slightly after them, and all of that, and I just felt: you've got to speak up if you're going to speak up. But would I do it again? As I said in this thing, I don't know if I would, knowing what I know now. And I don't know -- have solutions. It's not Britain specific. This is true as, I say in my book, of Netherlands, Germany; United States is even worse, there you're afraid of being shot, at least here you're only worried about being stabbed. And, you know, Australia, the same.

So I don't think it's British-specific or UK-specific. This is a general problem now. Also with the online misinformation where people can share something which gets shared 4,000 or 5,000 times and becomes the truth because it's been shared, I don't know what you do about it. That's, I guess, something I hope I'll learn from you guys, because I'm pretty stuck on solutions. I can see the problem, I just can't see a way forward.

**Lead 2A**: Thank you.

Were you offered support by the Scottish Government to try to deal with these distressing situations in which you found yourself?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes.

**Lead 2A**: And did you find that adequate?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: I didn't take it up, actually, so I don't know what was there. I know it was always there, the offer was made, but I think in these kind of instances you just have to kind of stick close to your values, your family, your friends. And, as I say in my book, everyone I've met in person has been absolutely lovely. We can debate -- I think that the line is we can have healthy debate over how you manage a response, what is acceptable loss of life, what are impositions on people's freedoms. But I think when it gets into mud-slinging, you know, name calling, threats, hate speech, that's when it's crossed the line. And I think unfortunately in a democracy you have the healthy debate, but then it moves into sometimes the more toxic elements of it.

Yeah, most of us academics, we just want to be in our offices reading and writing, and for me being out in the field, so I'll go back to that quiet life and kind of leave this hopefully for the next generation whenever we have our next crisis arrive and help.

**Mr Dawson**: That seems like a good place to conclude.

Those are my questions, Professor, thank you very much.

There are some additional questions from core participants.

**Lady Hallett**: Ms Mitchell.

Questions From Ms Mitchell KC

**Ms Mitchell**: I'm obliged to my learned friend who's asked a number of questions that Scottish Covid Bereaved wished to be asked.

I am instructed by Aamer Anwar & Company to ask questions on behalf of the Scottish Covid Bereaved.

I appreciate it is difficult, but we're very much limited by time, and quite properly so, so could I ask you simply to try and keep your answers as concise as possible so we can hear what may be important answers to questions that you have.

You wrote a Guardian article, I don't need it brought up, but for the Inquiry its INQ000335963, and in that article you differentiated between the way the Scottish Government dealt with making decisions and the UK Government, and you said the Scottish Government's approach was different because in making the decision to bring critics into the room this helped diversify the views and avoid groupthink; and I think we've already heard about your lively debates in that regard with someone else who was involved in the process.

How were you aware that there was no one in the UK Government providing these critical views?

I suppose I've listened to your evidence this morning and, in the same way that you were communicating directly with our First Minister, it's probably the case that other scientists were directly communicating with ministers down south; might that be the case?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Yes, I guess it's me comparing -- I was on a UK Cabinet Office advisory group as well as -- you know, I was quite critical of both governments, I should say. I did an interview with Politics Scotland on the Sunday, I think March 14th it was or the 15th, and was very critical about how things were going. And the difference, I felt, was that the Scottish advisory group invited me on and said "Stop throwing stones and help us build a response, if you really think you can help", which is a real challenge. It's easier to be outside throwing stones, I'll tell you that.

Then on the other side, you know, I -- same, you know, push to UK Government, I offered to come in to help, colleagues did as well. I heard the evidence of other colleagues who've sat on SAGE and other groups, and they were kind of more blocked if they felt their message wasn't being heard. And so I feel that was the comparison I was trying to make which is: I thought if someone's saying "That's going off", you can invite them in and say, "Well, how do you think we should make it better?" Then you actually at least get a healthier debate, where I felt that did not happen with the UK Government. On the group I was on, it was very apart from decision-making, we were several layers away.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: Well, you may have been so concise you've answered my next question, which is: who were the critics in the room? I suppose your answer to that was "me"?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Me and others as well, I mean, you're going to hear from others this week --

**Ms Mitchell KC**: Indeed.

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: -- that I know. So I think, yeah, it's a smart lesson in public policy that if someone's criticising you, you get them to help build, because then you get a better response and you also quiet them because they're responsible as well in terms of trying to do something better.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: To provide solutions rather than just point out problems?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: Exactly, yeah.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: I'd like to move on to another question now. This is quite a broad question, but I am going to focus it much more because I fear that if I was to ask you the original question I was granted leave, it's enough for a PhD.

In your evidence this morning you've talked about mistakes at a UK level, and I've noted quite a few of them. If I might highlight those, they include failure to look at other countries, you talk about a lack of humility; cynical fatalism, that we moved too quickly from containment to mitigation; the issue of border measures, you spoke of the examples of other countries, Norway and Australia, limiting influx in testing; you said we were too late in pursuing the testing strategy; that our messaging to go and stop was perhaps not the correct communication; and also failure to have multidisciplinary fields working together, so I suppose cross-pollinate ideas.

Against that background I would ask you to consider -- on the basis, I suppose, that this Inquiry wants to learn lessons and see how it can do better in the inevitable next pandemic -- what, if any, one mistake was specifically made by the Scottish Government in their handling of the pandemic that we could learn lessons from and do differently in the next one?

**Professor Devi Sridhar**: I think the biggest mistake was around testing, and that affects so many issues, in the February/March period, that we didn't have a testing strategy, capacity, capabilities. I think that, and then linked to that, I would say, I'm thinking of what's kind of devolved, like NHS Scotland, they didn't have adequate PPE. This was a huge issue for at least, like, my medical students who were working on wards and didn't have appropriate protection.

So I would say, I mean, the big lesson -- this is why the countries did start running with testing even from mid-January -- is you need to have a testing system up, because you need to know who's infectious, and if you know who's infectious then you can avoid others becoming infected from that person, and I think we were very late in Scotland as well on that. I guess you'll hear about why, but that I'd say was the biggest failing in the early days.

And can I also offer my condolences to the bereaved and those who have lost loved ones.

**Ms Mitchell**: My Lady, those are my questions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Mitchell. That completes the evidence?

Thank you very much indeed, Professor, very grateful to you. As you may know, I've heard about the kind of abuse that experts like you have suffered, from amongst others Professor Sir Chris Whitty, and it's dreadful. I know how distressing it must be, and as you say the impact on people: why would they bother in future to help the country help prevent future deaths? So it's absolutely distressing and on many angles, but I am afraid you can't look to me for an answer because I've had to put up a similar kinds of abuse and I don't know the answer. So all we can hope is that people like you continue to feel that public service is worthwhile.

So thank you very much indeed.

**The Witness**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Right, I gather I now have to rise because our next witness has Covid.

**Mr Dawson**: If I could just explain that the next witness is Professor Andrew Morris. He does indeed have Covid. Fortunately for our purposes arrangements have been made for him to appear remotely. I understand that this means that there'll be around 20 minutes to set that up, and we will return and hear his evidence.

**Lady Hallett**: Indeed. I think one also needs to remember, having had Covid more than once myself, one does get very tired. I mean, one thinks one's going to be okay, and I gather the Professor thinks he'll be fine, but I think we need to make sure that we really restrict our questions to those that are absolutely essential. Very well, I shall return -- you're going to tell me 3.05? I think you are. Yes. I was hoping I might get away with 15 minutes, but I can't. 3.05.

Thank you again.

**The Witness**: Thank you.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Mr Dawson**: Thank you, my Lady.

*(2.45 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(3.05 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Professor, it's rather strange having you on a screen in the witness box. I don't know if you know where you are in our hearing room.

**Mr Dawson**: The next witness is Professor Andrew Morris, my Lady.
