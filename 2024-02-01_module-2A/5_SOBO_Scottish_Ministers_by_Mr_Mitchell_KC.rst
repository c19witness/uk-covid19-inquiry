5. Submissions on Behalf of Scottish Ministers by Mr Mitchell KC
================================================================

**Mr Mitchell**: Thank you, my Lady. These are the oral submissions on behalf of the Scottish Government.

To begin where this module began, three weeks ago, with the impact film, the poignant testimonies, together with the evidence of Jane Morrison, all of whom spoke with palpable love for those whom they had lost, could not fail to move, nor could anyone have but the greatest sympathy for those who suffered and suffer today from Long Covid or mental health issues as a result of this virus.

Their participation in the film and their evidence showed a bravery that an onlooker may not fully understand and that perhaps we who appear regularly in courtrooms across the country do not always appreciate or come to take for granted.

It is of course by continuing to speak of the people we have lost that we keep their memories fresh and alive, so on behalf of the Scottish Government we pay tribute to the representatives of Scottish Covid Bereaved who have attended these hearings over the last three weeks. We also pass our deep sympathies and condolences to the others, the many thousands who have lost loved ones, who have suffered and who continue to suffer.

What more can the Scottish Government do than offer its sympathies? Well, it can learn. The Scottish Government does listen, it does learn, and it does adapt. Throughout the pandemic, the Scottish Government's prime focus and intention was to protect the public, the people of Scotland, as best it could from the harms of the disease. The Scottish Government acknowledges that it did not get everything right. Where there were missteps, it deeply regrets them. Decisions were taken in good faith. Some, and acknowledging the limitations of a hindsight judgement, would be taken differently today.

It is important to remember, as we have heard many times, that there was no single simple and certain way to respond. The very fact that so many different views have been expressed on the steps and measures taken, so many different opinions on what should or should not have been done by the Scottish Government and the other governments of the four nations surely demonstrates this very point.

In this oral closing statement, the Scottish Government revisits the themes that it set out in its opening statement, and makes a number of observations on the evidence that has been heard, which it ties in with the themes that were identified by Mr Dawson on Day 1 of the module. It does so in order constructively to assist the Inquiry in making recommendations, which will help a future Scottish Government in responding to the next global health emergency. A fully considered written statement will be provided to the Inquiry by 23 February.

So the first theme that we looked at in the opening statement was the period January to March 2020. Ministers recognised that a great deal of evidence has been led in respect of the timing of the first intervention to stop the spread of the virus. Knowing what is known now, Scottish Ministers would have wished to move faster in March 2020 in issuing a stay-at-home instruction. The evidence before the Inquiry shows that the medical and scientific advice which the Scottish Ministers had access to came through the UK's scientific advisory structures, principally by way of the COBR briefings. That scientific advice did not recommend lockdown until very shortly before that decision was made.

In the context of a lockdown by Scotland, independent of the rest of the United Kingdom, financial support and incentives for employers and workers would have been essential. So, practical financial considerations would have remained.

However, linked to this and an issue which may merit consideration, is how devolved governments can have the conditions in place to provide the flexibility and the real ability to respond to a future pandemic in a way that suits the particular demographics of that country. In practical terms, if the Scottish Government felt compelled to put in place a stay-at-home requirement in a future pandemic, how would the UK-held funding and administrative capacity for essential supporting features such as furlough be guaranteed?

There were many distressing situations that were caused by the virus and the measures taken to limit its spread. The situation specific to care homes caused both by the virus and by the measures taken to limit the spread was captured in the evidence of Dr McMenamin and Professor Phin. The dilemma facing decision-makers was set out in the evidence of Ms Jeane Freeman. I do not repeat that here, except to note the point that studies such as the PHS report on discharges to care homes referred to by Professor Phin showed that discharge from hospitals was not the driving factor in care home outbreaks in Scotland. Care home size was much more strongly associated with the risk of an outbreak than all other care home characteristics, including hospital discharge.

Nonetheless, the lessons of having a testing infrastructure in place and the need to prioritise some of the most vulnerable in our society are there for all to see.

The second theme that we looked at in the opening statement was leadership, the underpinning structures and decision-making. It is no part of our submission to say that every decision taken by Ministers was correct, but we invite the Inquiry to accept that Ministers took their decision-making duty seriously. We do not believe that there is evidence that could contradict that.

The evidence also showed that they put in place structures and systems to give them access to extensive and integrated expert advice, all to support rapid decision-making.

Important decisions were taken at Cabinet, unless Cabinet took the view that it was proper to delegate that responsibility to the First Minister or to the Deputy First Minister. The ultimate -- structures were put in place to ensure that Ministers, as the ultimate decision-makers, received those balancing factors and that due weight was paid to all of them.

Evidence of Cabinet decision-making and the rationale behind and supporting those decisions is contained in the many detailed Cabinet papers which the Inquiry has. The Scottish Ministers would welcome the Inquiry's consideration of these. They identify when decisions were taken and the supporting information that Ministers had access to. We will set out the INQ numbers for these Cabinet papers and the related material when we come to submit our written submission.

In relation to informal messaging it is undeniable that the messages show people working together constructively and intensely at all hours of the day and night to support Ministers in their decision-making. Further, as Lesley Fraser pointed out, it would in practice be near impossible for a decision to be carried out by or on behalf of government without evidence of that appearing in formal records.

The Inquiry has material before it which will enable it to ascertain whether the decisions carried out by the Scottish Government are those recorded in its formal systems.

In compliance with legislation, policies and plans on document retention and management have been in place for several years. As Lesley Fraser explained, it is taken very seriously. The requirement to transfer the salient points of any business discussion and/or decision to the formal records system is set out. The chief difficulty appears to have been that not all individuals followed it or there was inconsistent interpretation of its meaning.

It is right and proper that the Scottish Government acknowledges both the Inquiry's and the public's consternation with regard to informal messaging use during the pandemic. It is clear to the Scottish Government that it must learn lessons in this area. And as the First Minister said in evidence last week, an external review has been commissioned.

The third theme that we looked at in the opening statement was the Scottish Government's strategies and decisions during the pandemic. As this Inquiry has recognised, by the very existence of Modules 2A, 2B and 2C, devolved governments are responsible for a large portion of the pandemic response across three of the four nations of the UK. The Scottish Ministers not only had the powers to take the decisions they did in the pandemic, but they had the duty to exercise these powers and to reach decisions on the basis of the facts and circumstances in Scotland. Often those facts and circumstances were different from those prevailing in other parts of the UK. That approach was significantly different from that of the UK Government for England for good reason and not for the sake simply of being different.

The Scottish Government did not pursue a zero Covid policy -- which, as we heard from the former First Minister yesterday, was not meant literally -- to the exclusion of consideration of the harm that that would do to the economy and society, including disproportionate harm to those who experienced inequalities. Nor, in late 2020 and early 2021, did it make the same mistakes twice. Rather, it anticipated the potential for a second wave and put in a carefully thought through set of NPIs drawing on experience of earlier in the pandemic.

Nor, later in 2021, did it simply give up. It put in place a strong NPI response, but its options were constrained by the funding of the furlough scheme. More generally, the Scottish Ministers sought to suppress the virus to a very low level while minimising broader harms. In the autumn of 2020, for example, therefore, Ministers had to consider both the need for more stringent actions to suppress the second wave and the additional harm that stringent action would entail, including to those who felt these effects most keenly.

Similarly, in the autumn and winter of 2021, facing still more infectious variants but also beginning to see the effects of the vaccines in weakening the link between infections and deaths, Ministers had to consider all four harms and not solely the pressures faced by hospitals, significant though these were, while they set out their strategy. As Professor Sir Gregor Smith, the Chief Medical Officer, noted in his evidence, we should bear in mind that risk is dynamic, it altered over time influenced by therapeutics and the vaccine which came into play at about that point, thus the balance of harms had changed and with it the proportionality of certain measures.

Outcomes were also different, as the Module 2 evidence of Sir Ian Diamond, chief executive of the UK Statistics Authority, showed. In particular, age-standardised mortality rates, or ASMRs, take account of differences in population size and age structure, and therefore allow comparisons to be made between the four nations in a way that other mortality outcomes data do not. A macabre statistic, but Sir Ian's evidence showed that over the period March 2020 to February 2022, Scotland had the lowest age-standardised mortality rates for deaths involving Covid-19 of the four nations, at 124.9 per 100,000 people compared to a rate of 145 per 100,000 people for England, not a statistic to be trumpeted but prima facie evidence that outcomes were different.

Ministers were aware throughout the pandemic of their duties under equalities legislation and of the importance of impact assessments to decision-making. But the decisions taken in relation to inequalities were, as with all decisions during the pandemic, not easy. The Scottish Ministers recognise that the interventions to limit the spread of Covid-19 themselves caused harm, exacerbated inequalities and disproportionately affected the most vulnerable people in Scotland. Ministers sought to consider the full range of impacts of those interventions and to ensure that they were necessary and proportionate. Ministers sought to minimise the harm experienced by everyone in society, and especially those at greater risk of harm, not only from the virus but from the isolation, reduced access to care and support, and other impacts of suppression measures.

But the Scottish Government recognises that, pandemic or no pandemic, more has to be done for the most vulnerable in society, as was made clear in the evidence of Dr Donald Macaskill of Scottish Care and Dr Jim Elder-Woodward.

The fourth theme that we looked at in the opening statement was working with other governments and local authorities. The Scottish Government recognises that the best way to work with partners and stakeholders in a crisis is to invest in constructive, effective relationships in calmer times and to listen and engage with those close to local communities.

We acknowledge the evidence of the STUC and COSLA that the Scottish Government went to lengths to engage with employees and local authorities while accepting that the intensity of the emergency affected both the amount and the quality of the engagement that was possible.

It is, we think, fair to say that a recurring theme of governmental exchanges was the concern of the devolved governments that decisions on funding and the furlough scheme were driven by the UK Government's decisions for England.

We have already set out that we consider that matters in the gift of the UK Government, such as flexibility in funding arrangements for devolved administrations in emergencies and for schemes such as furlough, may warrant a particular focus.

Ministers are also clear that in a future pandemic devolved governments ought to be true partners in situations where decisions taken at a UK level affect devolved responsibilities.

That aside, the Scottish Government wishes to place on record its thanks and appreciation for the work of those in all four governments and of scientists, academics and clinicians more generally from across the UK who worked together to share data and expertise in order to understand and suppress the virus.

The fifth theme that we looked at in our opening statement was data. When this pandemic initially came to our shores, there were limited data available. Public Health Scotland and the Scottish Government worked at pace and under great pressure to draw data together in order to provide ministers with the information they required to take informed decisions. We note the Public Health Scotland dashboard is one example of this. Evidence has shown that at times access to data was not as timely and straightforward as it could be. The need for further improvements to UK and Scottish data infrastructure and the processes in place to access data were identified and the Inquiry may wish to highlight the need for this work to continue at pace.

The sixth and final theme that we looked at in our opening statement was public communications. No decision or action by government can be effective if not effectively communicated, whether in relation to adherence with NPIs or persuading people to come forward for initial, second and booster doses of vaccine.

Professor Reicher gave supportive evidence of the way in which the former First Minister delivered her public messages. Trust in the government's messages remained high and citizens undertook significant sacrifices as part of the national effort to limit the spread of the virus.

My Lady, those are our overall submissions, which we will supplement in writing, but before I sit down, certain thanks are due.

On behalf of the Scottish Government, I take this opportunity to thank you and your team for coming to Scotland, for your hard work in delivering this module, but of course the module could not have been run without the support of the staff, the ushers, the managers, the witness support staff and the technicians from RTS, and we thank them for their assistance to us over the past few weeks. We thank the witnesses who gave of their time to come to give evidence. We thank the many Scottish Government employees, the partners, including the other three governments of the UK, and the stakeholders, who worked tirelessly to steer Scotland through the pandemic. And most of all we thank the people of Scotland for their trust, forbearance, co-operation and fortitude during a very difficult and at times very dark period in our nation's history.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Mitchell.

Mr Dawson. Closing remarks by LEAD COUNSEL TO THE INQUIRY for MODULE 2A

**Mr Dawson**: My Lady, I have some very brief closing remarks.

First of all, a clarification.

Yesterday during the evidence of Ms Sturgeon she was taken to a document, INQ000292564. It might help if we can have that put up. This was, you will recall, my Lady, an email chain beginning on 19 July.

We can see on page 6 an email that -- which indicates that the Deputy First Minister, Mr Swinney, had requested a call to discuss international travel and that the then First Minister was copied into this chain.

We then looked at another email connected to this subject on page 5. This email reads, as your Ladyship will recall:

"It won't matter how much ministers might justify it on health grounds, the Spanish Government will conclude it is entirely political; they won't forget; there is a real possibility they will never approve EU membership for an independent Scotland as a result."

I can clarify that this particular email was sent to Ken Thomson, the director-general for constitutional and external affairs, from a Scott Wightman, the director for external affairs, both civil servants, and not Mr Swinney or his office.

With your permission, the Inquiry has already adduced in evidence and published a number of documents through the course of these hearings. In short, this comprises pages of documents brought up on the screen during the hearings, and the statements of witnesses who have given oral evidence.

As with previous modules, we expect you will inevitably wish to have in evidence a wider body of material than this for the purposes of writing your report. The M2A team have provisionally identified a list of additional documents which we will seek your permission to adduce.

These include around 114 statements of witnesses who have not given oral evidence, but whose statements you may wish to rely upon when compiling your report. We propose to circulate a list of these documents to core participants, so they have an opportunity to review it and either object to or propose additional documents for inclusion on the list.

Thereafter, with your permission, the Inquiry will adduce in evidence and publish the documents set out in the final list of materials on the Inquiry's website.

If your Ladyship will indulge me for one further moment, may I also please pay tribute to all of the members of the Inquiry team, who have worked tirelessly in playing their part in the conduct of these important hearings for the people of Scotland. They all have my thanks for their work and their dedication in conducting it despite, in the case of those who journeyed north, the cold, both outside and at times inside this building.

In particular, may I express publicly my thanks to the paralegals, the solicitor team, and my learned juniors, Mr Tariq, Mrs Arlidge, Ms Condron, Ms Painter and Mr McWhirter. All members of the legal team have given their all in the delivery of these evidential sessions. We hope that those who have lost loved ones in the Covid-19 pandemic, and those who have otherwise been harmed by the virus or the countermeasures taken by government to fight it, agree. They deserve no less than our very best.
