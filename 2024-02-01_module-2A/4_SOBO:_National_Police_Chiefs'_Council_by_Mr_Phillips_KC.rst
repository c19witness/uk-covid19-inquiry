4. Submissions on Behalf of the National Police Chiefs' Council by Mr Phillips KC
=================================================================================

**Mr Phillips**: My Lady, by this time you'll be more than familiar with the roles and function of the NPCC, and there is, I think, no need for me to remind you of any of that. And you know too that in this module it represents the interests of the Police Service of Scotland, which again I'll refer to as Police Scotland, And finally you know that, as I predicted in my opening submissions, policing has played a very minor part in the evidence which you've heard here in the last weeks.

So in these brief closing submissions, I'd like to highlight some of the themes which have emerged from that evidence. But before that, if I may, may I just make some points by way of context.

The first is that, of course, most of the challenges faced by policing during the pandemic had to be faced by the police throughout the UK. So the experience of Police Scotland mirrors, to a very large extent, the experience of the English forces which you heard about in Module 2, and which will no doubt be repeated in what you hear in the next two modules.

My Lady, that leads to my next general point, which is that the work of the police in Scotland and elsewhere during that pandemic encompassed far more than the question of the enforcement of the coronavirus regulations, which features as a sub-issue on your list of issues in this module, as it did in Module 2.

Normal policing activity had to carry on, so far as possible, despite the difficult conditions, and of course police leaders knew that it would continue to carry on once the pandemic came to an end, whenever that was. Which takes me to my final general point which, in my submission, has to be borne in mind when considering all questions concerning policing during the pandemic, and it's that in this country we have policing by consent.

In the specific context of the Covid regulations in which the police found themselves in the unfamiliar territory of public health policing, the formidable task faced here in Scotland, as in every part of the UK, was to encourage the public to comply with the regulations whilst also retaining their trust.

So turning, then, to the evidence about policing which you've heard in this module, I'd like to start, if I may, with the NPCC's four Es guidance, which was adopted at the start of the pandemic by Police Scotland and from which, as you've heard, the police never wavered during the various stages of the crisis.

Underpinning that guidance was the same fundamental principle of policing by consent. The aim of the guidance was compliance and not enforcement, which was and remained the last resort.

The statistics which you've heard in the evidence suggest that the guidance was effective and successful in achieving that aim. And here we are on firm ground because of the CVI system, which was established by Police Scotland in the early days of the pandemic, with great foresight if I may say so, and which recorded all encounters between the police and the public in relation to the regulations, ie each of the four Es. And the data generated as a result shows that the vast majority of encounters were resolved before the fourth E, enforcement, was reached.

The police's figures, which may indeed be conservative, suggest that 88% of such encounters were resolved short of enforcement, and you heard the current First Minister say that the figure might be as high as 94%.

My Lady, it follows from this that when considering the evidence concerning fixed penalty notices given by non-police witnesses last week, you're concerned with a tiny minority of the occasions on which the police interacted with the public in relation to the regulations, and that means in turn that all of the statistical analysis subsequently produced in which the total number of FPNs has been broken down by reference to certain categories of recipient, is itself concerned with small percentages of that small minority of cases.

Now, this academic and analytical effort was of course only made possible because Police Scotland provided the data in a way which was, I'd suggest, consistent with the open and transparent approach which they took to their work throughout the course of the pandemic.

There's perhaps no better example of that approach, you may think, that the independent Advisory Group on Police Use of Temporary Powers, the IAG, about which you've heard in evidence.

It was established early on in order to assist the police in the difficult task they faced in dealing with these novel and often changing regulations, and to give assurance to the public via the Police Authority to which it reported. It met regularly during the pandemic under distinguished and independent leadership. Its membership, as you've heard, was varied and expert. And Police Scotland were able to draw on its work as the pandemic continued and, as I noted in my opening submissions, they also set up an extensive lesson learning exercise so that best practice could be identified and any necessary changes implemented in a process which continued after the crisis had passed.

My Lady, we'll put in detailed written submissions next month, but at this stage, and having drawn out some of the main themes of the evidence you've heard here, my submission to you is that Police Scotland are to be commended and not criticised for the way in which they met the challenge they faced during the pandemic.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Phillips.

Mr Mitchell, I think you complete the submissions.
