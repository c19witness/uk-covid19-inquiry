========================

*PROFESSOR SIR IAN DIAMOND (sworn).*

Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry

**Mr Keith**: Good morning.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Good morning.

**Lead Inquiry**: Could you give the Inquiry, please, your full name.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I am Ian Diamond and I am the National Statistician.

**Lead Inquiry**: I'm going to call you Professor Diamond, if I may. You are in fact Professor Sir Ian Diamond, but for ease of reference, that's how I will address you, if I may.

Professor, you have been good enough to provide two very extensive witness statements concerning the extremely important issue of statistics, the relevancy to this inquiry into the pandemic of which is obvious.

You have provided one -- dated 8 September 2023, INQ000268012, I think that's the one on the screen. You would have signed that, I think, on 8 September, with the usual declaration of the truth of its contents.

You also provided a second statement in which you produced a very large number of tables and charts relating to specific areas of data and statistics, compiled by the ONS, the Office of National Statistics, to which we'll come in a moment. Is that one, dated 11 September, INQ000271436?

Whilst you give evidence, Professor, could you please remember to keep your voice up and also speak as slowly as you are capable of, in order to assist our stenographer.

I'm going to start, if I may, with that first statement, the statement of 8 September, Professor, because it sets out, does it not, the building blocks for the data, the specific data and statistics, which you then provide, setting out how the UK Statistics Authority and the Office for National Statistics operated during the pandemic.

Dealing firstly with the nature of the ONS and of the UK Statistics Authority, you are the National Statistician?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: What is the National Statistician?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: The National Statistician was a post first brought into place by Winston Churchill when he was Prime Minister, when data from different parts of government were coming to him and he decided that he needed someone to adjudicate on which ones he should use. And that is a role that I take very, very seriously.

But at the same time I am the chief executive of the UK Statistics Authority. The UK Statistics Authority is an independent body which is charged with all matters related to statistics, both regulation and production of official statistics, and I head the Office for National Statistics, which is, if you like, the statistics production arm of the UK Statistics Authority.

In addition, I am head of the Government Statistical Service, which covers statisticians right across government. I provide professional leadership to them, although they are employed within their department, or arm's length body. And I am head of the Analysis Function, which brings together statisticians, economists, operational researchers, actuaries, geographers, social researchers and operational researchers right across government.

**Lead Inquiry**: That is quite a number of statistical hats to have to wear, Professor.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: It is.

**Lead Inquiry**: The position, therefore, is that the UK Statistics Authority is actually the independent statutory body established by law, and you are, as the National Statistician, as you've said, the chief executive of the board of that body. It has a function, or part of it is the Office for National Statistics, which produces the statistics and the data, and that authority provides oversight of the overall provision of statistics by the government which, might be usefully described, as you said, as the Government Statistical Service?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: But for our purposes, therefore, what we are most concerned about is the production of statistics by that production function arm, namely the Office for National Statistics?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: It does the heavy lifting of the production of statistics?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Very much so.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

You are supported by three Deputy National Statisticians; is that right?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, the three Deputy National Statisticians, each of whom take a different area, one economic statistics, one population and health statistics, and one, broadly, data governance and IT. I'd have to say that over the course of the pandemic, sometimes as different areas became more important, we flexed some of those responsibilities, but three Deputy National Statisticians. And I was also supported from --

**Lead Inquiry**: Just slow down a little bit, please, Professor.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I will slow down a little bit. I was also supported from September 2020 by second permanent secretary Sam Beckett.

**Lead Inquiry**: It is obvious that during the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics discharged the extremely important functions of informing decision-makers, the government, with regular data and analytical insights, and also informing the public with the state of play and what the statistics and the insights produced by the ONS were amounting to.

We're going to look at the specific supply of data in a moment, and the particular analyses that you produced, but in general terms, did the ONS start producing data for government at a relatively early stage of the crisis, or in your opinion could it have provided that vital support at an earlier stage, and no doubt would have done so had it been asked?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes. I mean, I think we became seriously part of the production of new insights in March 2020. I think my personal view would be that we should be involved at the earliest possible stage, but of course you need to know what questions there are to be asked, and so we were involved from an early stage but perhaps not the earliest stage.

**Lead Inquiry**: From the stage at which you became involved, did you produce the whole plethora of charts and analyses and datasets, or did the system ramp up to the point at which you were providing a great deal many datasets and analyses?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I think I would have to say that we were agile in responding at different times to different questions, but there were really three main areas I would point to. Firstly, we needed to maintain our business as usual measurement of the economy, for example monthly inflation rates. Now, that's hard if you're not able to go into shops to check on prices. It's hard if companies are furloughed to know how you estimate their output. So there were some changes that we had to make very quickly to maintain that economic measurement.

Secondly, we moved very quickly to providing insight. Very early on in the pandemic, I did feel that while data were flying very quickly -- actually, as I said to one person, I remember saying, "This is a data deluge, we need to bring data insight", and I pushed very hard, and ONS pushed very hard to make sure that instead of, for example, saying "Tell me something interesting about", we moved to "What is the question you want an answer to?" And we, ONS, embedded someone inside the Covid Taskforce in the Cabinet Office to be able to get those kind of questions.

And that led us to really answering new questions. So, for example, setting up a Covid infection survey to understand the level of positivity and, indeed, antibodies in the country, and also to understand more about opinions and attitudes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Have you therefore referred to an important distinction in this field, which is the distinction between the provision of datasets, hard statistics, and insights by way of analysis drawn from the various surveys which the ONS carried out?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Well, sometimes you would do analysis on those former datasets. So, yes, one provides data and enables others to use it, but at the same time one does analysis which enables questions to be answered.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was the ONS therefore able to produce data and insights across a very wide number of societal themes? So, for example, economic data, social data, plainly data in relation to health, and mortality, and also across great swathes of British public life, so across business, across schools, and so on?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Very much so, and some of those data, you mentioned economic measurement, were things we would do anyway, but we had to pivot in the situation, where -- for example, we couldn't send interviewers into homes -- to make different ways to collect those data.

But also we produced new data and we did new surveys. We tended to do new surveys in partnership with real experts in those areas. An example would be when there was a need to understand what was going on in care homes, we partnered with Professor Laura Shallcross from University College London, who was an expert in social care, and to design with her a survey of care homes using the care home chain, VIVALDI.

**Lead Inquiry**: So did you introduce a number of different surveys, the Business Impact of Coronavirus Survey, the Schools Infection Survey (SIS). You've mentioned the Covid-19 Infection Survey already, CIS.

Did you also introduce or make changes to a particular type of data or analysis known as the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN)? What is that and how does it differ from other surveys or from datasets?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Well, the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey was a survey which went out every two months, and is what it says, an opinions survey, to understand attitudes. You know, sometimes it's nice to know fixed data on how much a firm is making, but sometimes you need to know attitudes, and the only way I know how to get attitudes is to ask people.

So we have a methodologically rigorous survey which went out every couple of months. We pivoted that very quickly to go out every week, and so it would go out on a Wednesday, we would close responses very early on a Monday morning, and have results Monday lunchtime, so that we were able to understand what was going on and the attitudes of the public in a really quick and timely manner. And we worked with parts of government who wanted questions put into that survey to enable them to get the insights very quickly that they needed for their policy making.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just on that question of OPN, Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, was the Cabinet Office, in particular the Covid-19 Taskforce, and the Covid-19 Taskforce was only brought into play in the late summer, were they primary users of that data in particular?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: They certainly used it. And indeed, as I indicated, we had embedded someone into the Cabinet Office to be able to understand the key issues of which answers were needed. So they were primary users, as were other parts of government, including Health.

And also we were able to get behavioural information. So one of my colleagues joined what is known as SPI-B, the behavioural science part of SAGE, to make sure that some of the behavioural science questions that they wanted asked could be asked.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did you in fact personally yourself attend SAGE?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I personally attended SAGE from the 15th meeting, on 13 March 2020.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did the ONS also create something known as the Covid-19 latest insights page --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- in order to educate the public, who had access to that information, and it collated other separate datasets together centrally to make it easier to --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: We thought it was incredibly important to provide accessible data to the public, and we did this in a number of ways, and the insights was where we tried to bring together data from various sources and put them in one easily accessible place.

The other point that I would mention is that throughout the pandemic there were daily press conferences, and early in those press conferences perhaps the quality of the slides that were presented were not of the highest level and so we were asked, and embedded a team in the Government Communication Service from pretty early on, to help with the production of those slides.

And I know I would say this, but I did feel that the quality of those slides improved greatly when the ONS team were there.

**Lead Inquiry**: You say in your statement that the organisation worked hard to maintain quality whilst delivering to a fast timeline.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That's right.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that a euphemism for saying you worked flat out --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: It is. I mean, just --

**Lead Inquiry**: -- day and night?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Well, just to give you one example, if I may. We are charged with providing weekly death registration by cause of death. Since 1993, the death certificates come to us and we have -- we can, computer-wise, you know, put them into cause of death reasons.

There wasn't a cause of death for Covid. We worked with the World Health Organisation quickly to define a cause of death, but there was obviously no time immediately for that to be automatically run.

So my colleagues, who do death, cause of death registration, and I have to say this is a pretty stressful thing to do, went on to 12-hour shifts to enable us to be able to deliver those statistics on a weekly basis. And I really do hold out my hat to them.

**Lead Inquiry**: Can we just take a step back, please, and look for a moment at the phrase "weekly death registration by cause of death". Is the position in the United Kingdom that every death has to be registered, perhaps with the assistance of a coroner or a coroner's officer, and that that is a formal document, but it is a document limited, in terms of the information that it provides, to the age, sex, cause of death and, I think, the location of the deceased?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That's right.

**Lead Inquiry**: Therefore, the ONS could access, on a weekly basis, cause of death registration documents, but that cause of death did not in the early stage include, you've just told us, Covid-19 as being a cause of death?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Well, it could do. The cause of death could be written by the practitioner, and was, as Covid, but what we didn't have was an automatic process to then turn that into the weekly statistics. So we had to take the cause of death -- or the death certificate, read it, take a view, and then manually transform it, until we were able to actually move to an automatic process.

**Lead Inquiry**: We'll look at the system in more detail later, but were those weekly cause of death registration documents the genesis for the core death from Covid datasets --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, for death --

**Lead Inquiry**: -- produced by the ONS?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That's absolutely right, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I should just add a rider in that they don't include deaths which have to have a coroner's inquest. We get them, but only after the inquest, and that can be some time.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

Could we have, please, on the screen INQ000252620.

You have produced for us, have you not, by way of exhibit, a list of all the datasets that you produced during January 2020 to the end --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Should I be able to see something on my screen, sir?

**Lead Inquiry**: You will in a moment.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Thank you.

**Lead Inquiry**: We're not quite as fast as the ONS, Professor.

So that's INQ000252620.

**Lady Hallett**: Whilst that document is coming up, you said that you worked with WHO about the cause of death for Covid sufferers. What was the end result? In other words, what went on the death certificate to indicate that Covid was a cause?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: It could either be death "virus identified" or death "virus not identified", and the distinction really is a minor one, but it's very much the one around had the person had a test and had that test proved positive. And we would put the two together, because sometimes -- you know, the medical practitioner is pretty good at identifying what has happened, we would suggest.

**Lady Hallett**: Doesn't it depend on the medical practitioner? I mean, I've seen a death certificate that said "old age" or "heart failure", which arguably, sadly, applies to -- everybody dies of -- I mean, was there a problem in getting the medical practitioners to provide the information you needed so that the government could know just how many people were dying with this awful disease?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: We believe that pretty quickly the medical practitioners were able to identify whether there had been a test. If there had been a test then they wrote Covid-19 either as the primary or the secondary ...

I mean, I have also seen many certificates which says "old age" or whatever, but, you know, we were getting that -- but also where there had not been a test but it was pretty clear to the medical practitioner -- and these are smaller numbers, the majority there'd been a test -- where there had not been a test, then it could be "virus not identified".

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Mr Keith**: Professor, I'm sorry to say that we're unable to get the document up on the screen that I had wished to put to you, so may I put the point in a different way.

The overall list of datasets which you provide are voluminous in number. You provided a very, very large number of datasets to the government during the pandemic.

Does the list of datasets show that from a relatively early stage, your datasets and your OPN surveys focused in on the impact of the pandemic on members of ethnic minority groups as well as on those who were clinically extremely vulnerable? So ethnicity and vulnerability were topics, positions, issues for your data examination to look at and they were from a relatively early stage?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Very much. One of our pillars at the Office for National Statistics is inclusivity, and we, if you like. Lived that value right the way through the pandemic, that we were trying to make sure that every citizen had a voice in our data and that we were, if you like, understanding, through our data, the inequalities that existed through this dreadful disease.

**Lead Inquiry**: In your statement there is a section dealing with quality and accuracy. It is obviously of huge importance that the information in the data that the Office for National Statistics provides is accurate. Is a great deal of work done to ensure the accuracy of the work product?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Well, yeah, the -- at the end of the day, we have to have the highest quality data, there's not much point in us giving people data which are not accurate.

Having said that, all data are subject to uncertainty, and we always try to give a measure of that uncertainty with our data. It's often called a confidence interval. But it's incredibly important; when you do a survey you're making an estimate of what's going on in a population and that estimate is subject to some uncertainty.

But we worked very hard to maintain quality, and I'd say in four different ways. Firstly, conceptual. You know, for example, if a company is furloughed, how do you estimate in the gross domestic products their output? Or if -- how do we estimate, in education outputs, home schooling? So, really, conceptual issues there.

Secondly, issues around data collection. We couldn't go into people's homes to ask them, so we pivoted very quickly to telephone interviewing, for example in our Crime Survey for England and Wales.

Thirdly, we introduced what we call weighting, to make sure -- to come back to your point about inclusivity, we weighted some of our data to make sure that they were really good population estimates, so methodological input.

And, finally, we had to pivot very quickly our own internal workforce to working from home, and we did that at great pace.

Those four areas, really done at pace, always focusing on quality.

**Lead Inquiry**: Professor Nazroo, who was a witness from whom my Lady heard last week, on the issue of ethnicity referred to ONS data drawn from the 2021 census, which included data that was backward looking, so it included in fact I think -- or rather, sorry, the survey or the dataset produced by the ONS included information that was backward looking, it looked back towards data from 2012 to 2019.

He described that particular dataset as being based upon experimental statistics, he described it as innovative and exciting, but ultimately open to some degree of debate or uncertainty.

What is the degree of accuracy or probity of experimental work done by the ONS?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: We would say it was highly accurate, but it's a new methodology.

And I think you are referring, with Professor Nazroo, to some work where we linked 2011 census data with mortality data between 2012 and 2014. And we are working with Professor Nazroo on that at the moment just to make sure that he is comfortable with what we have, and I would be delighted, if it would please you, to send you a short note, which should be ready in a couple of weeks, of that.

But you see there, what we're doing there is really innovative, because, as you rightly said, death registration does not include ethnicity. For very good reasons, actually. And -- but, therefore, what we did was link the death registration to the census data, which would have ethnicity, and of course one's ethnicity doesn't change, and that was innovative work -- we're very comfortable that it's accurate, but because it's innovative we call it, initially, experimental, before we finally move to doing it, if you like, on a very regular basis and when it would become a national statistic.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you.

Did you provide from January 2020 to May 2022 what you described as "management information" from ONS surveys to ministers, key officials, key departments? So information drawn from many, if not all, of the surveys, the CIS survey, the SIS survey, the weekly mortality statistics and so on to which I've referred. So you provided, for management purposes, to enable the government to respond more efficiently to the crisis --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, we did.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- certain amounts of data?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes. And we would always then publish them. But -- so, for example, with our Covid Infection Survey, we were ready so that we would, if you like, stop the last test -- or the last test which we would include would be on a Friday. It's quite a lot of analysis. You know, this isn't, I would suggest, you know, a question of just doing a few five-bar gates on the back of an envelope, there's a lot of mathematics that goes into making the estimate, and we were ready, typically by Tuesday evening, to have some numbers. And things were moving so quickly that we judged it was important to enable people to have those early data, which would then be subject to further quality assurance and preparation for publication, and they were then published on the Friday.

But particularly when, if you go back to some of the Omicron wave, where the doubling time was two and a half days, we didn't want, if you like, to be providing historical information, we needed be to providing data as quickly as we could, and so enabling government to have those numbers as management information, as they're called. But subsequently to publish them is the right thing, I would suggest, to do.

**Lead Inquiry**: Therefore did information go straight from the ONS to the Cabinet Office, to the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in the Cabinet Office, and to the data and dashboard team, which was the primary team concerned --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: There is a list which I could provide.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just a yes or no, Professor, will suffice.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you.

You've mentioned the Covid-19 latest insights, which is a live round-up of information. Over time, did that provision of information, that insight, change? Did it, in fact, expand, become developed and then ultimately merge with other roundups that the ONS produced?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Ultimately, yes. So we only -- we wanted just one. But yes, it definitely did change over time, as different questions became important. So, for example, our Opinions and Lifestyle Survey at times asked questions about attitudes to face mask wearing. Now, that is the sort of thing that would come in and then we wouldn't ask forever. So there was certainly an agility in what was there because we were providing answers to questions that were relevant at that particular time.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did you yourself have regular meetings with permanent secretaries, you attended SAGE as you described, did you meet also with the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Sir Chris Whitty, the Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and did the ONS engage with a number of government departments as well as the devolved administrations in order to be able to understand what it was that they wanted?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, and to explain the nuances of any analyses that we gave.

**Lead Inquiry**: You have described in outline a number of the different datasets and the surveys, the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, the Business Insights and Conditions Survey, and the Covid-19 Infection Survey.

Focusing for a moment on that latter survey, the Covid-19 Infection Survey, was the need for the sort of data that that infection survey produced discussed at a relatively early stage at SAGE by you at a particular meeting in April?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Indeed. You may recall that at that time test and trace was stretched, GPs were stretched, and the answer to the question "What proportion of the population are positive?" was one that was seen to be incredibly important.

I'd have to be honest and say when I'm asked to do this, the statistician in me says, "Let's do a survey", and so we designed very, very quickly a survey in partnership -- we wanted to work -- we are statisticians, not virologists and epidemiologists, and so we worked with the University of Oxford. And often these surveys, you know, rightly take quite a long time, but the importance and the urgency was such that we -- between a Thursday, when the SAGE meeting was held, we were in the field the following Thursday. And so that was much faster than we would normally do. And at that time we weren't sure how people would respond to giving swabs, to 20% giving blood, and we designed a longitudinal study, a longitudinal household study, which I remain extremely proud of the design and which has been extremely helpful in a number of other areas, for example in being able to monitor Long Covid.

**Lead Inquiry**: And was the CIS the largest regular survey of coronavirus infections and antibodies that the ONS carried out, did it start -- well, you've described how it commenced. There were pilots, were there not, that took place in England, and then field work began and that field work expanded to the devolved administrations --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: The pilots -- just because of the need, the pilots were very, very, if you like, quick and we expanded very quickly. We then brought on Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and we were asked in the summer, late summer of 2020, if we could move from national estimates to regional estimates. That requires an increase in the sample size, basically, and so we moved to a larger sample size, we were doing 150,000 swabs a fortnight, and that was the largest survey, certainly of the type that we did. It was the largest -- the only -- often -- I think probably the only survey of its type in the world and that required -- and that gave a lot of interest from other countries who wanted to gain some of the insights that we gained.

**Lead Inquiry**: Another area on which you focused your attention was the prevalence of the long-term symptoms following infection from Covid, known of course as Long Covid.

Your witness statement makes plain that you received a request from in fact No 10 Downing Street at one point, in September 2020, for data on the prevalence of the Long Covid condition.

When did the ONS start collecting data specifically on Long Covid, can you recall?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, so that request came from the data science unit within Downing Street, and as I indicated we had put in place a design which is called a longitudinal design, by which I mean we go back to the same people once a month, and so that's quite helpful in this case, and we were collecting some symptoms. So initially we used the design that we had and followed up people, and in late 2020 we were able to make some initial estimates of those people who had experienced symptoms for four weeks or more.

But at the same time we worked with other people who were, if you like, experts. So I know that you are speaking to, from your programme, Professor Khunti I think later this week.

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: We worked very closely with Professor Khunti, and also we worked with some of the Long Covid sufferers groups to be able to make sure that we had an appropriate survey. It was the Covid-19 survey, but we added appropriate questions around symptoms that could then enable us to make better estimates, because we had better symptoms data.

**Lead Inquiry**: So the upshot was, Professor, that having started to commence the collection of data on Long Covid, eventually you added questions on Long Covid to the main Covid Infection Survey, and then you ultimately produced monthly surveillance estimates on the prevalence of Long Covid, alongside the other monthly datasets that you provided?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That is correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just a yes or no, if you would --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- humour me in relation to that particular point. Thank you.

Can I turn, then, to mortality statistics in order to set out some of the ground rules relating to that type of data before we look at the actual charts.

During the period of the pandemic, were there two main data sources available on deaths: the data provided by the DHSC, generally daily; and the weekly death registration data that the ONS provided, of which you've already spoken?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did the DHSC data on deaths come from other bodies?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: No, so the DHSC data, which I think are very useful as, if you like, an indicator, are based on the reported deaths in hospitals. So that's --

**Lead Inquiry**: So the information came from other bodies such as NHS England, Public Health Wales, Health Protection --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: To the NHS.

**Lead Inquiry**: To the NHS?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: And they -- the DHSC published them. But of course that doesn't include deaths in private homes, for example, and it is just based on the number of deaths reported on a particular day, so one tended to see a reduction every weekend, just simply because, you know, deaths were not reported on those days.

I believe those DHSC data were incredibly useful as fast indicators of what was going on, but they did not have the true picture, and that came from our weekly data, which was able to be based on the death certificates as we have discussed earlier.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is this the nub of it, that the DHSC data originally, in the early days of April, reflected deaths in hospital where patients had tested positive; later they'd started to publish data daily of figures on deaths, of all deaths where there had been a positive test, wherever the death had taken place, so not just in hospital, but although the DHSC data turned itself around quicker and was generally indicative of trends, the ONS measure, which rests upon the registration of death certificates, provides a more accurate assessment of deaths involving Covid?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you.

Could you please answer this particularly difficult question about the death certificates: do the death certificates reflect deaths in which Covid-19 has played a part, or deaths relating from infection from Covid-19?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Both.

**Lead Inquiry**: Both. Is that in part why those statistics are therefore -- or those registrations are more accurate?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Deaths in care homes. Did the ONS produce data releases relating to deaths in care homes?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales, deaths notified to the Care Quality Commission, care home resident deaths registered in England and Wales?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did the ONS expand to produce an ever increasing list of surveys from, as I've mentioned, clinically extremely vulnerable people, international arrivals, students, attitudes, the care home study, the VIVALDI study, which you've already mentioned, the Liverpool mass testing study, the over 80s vaccine studies, and so on?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Very much so, and always in response to questions that we were being asked and which we could provide insight. And also, for example, we did one on prisons with the Ministry of Justice, we worked in partnership so that our contribution was often methodological and data collection, always working with experts to make sure that the content was appropriate.

.

**Lead Inquiry**: Would it be fair to say that by the end of the pandemic, the ONS, along with other bodies, provided a vast amount of data --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- concerning the impact of the pandemic?

Were there a number of other studies which may, therefore, lead one to conclude that the United Kingdom led the world in the provision of data from the REACT study, the SIREN cohort study, the CoMix surveys, the recovery trials, it was a vast amount of information by the end?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I think it's arrogant to say we led the world, but certainly we did many things that other countries didn't do, and I can't think of another country that was in the same place, and certainly --

**Lead Inquiry**: Well, that's my definition of leading.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Sorry.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

The ONS did not, as a general rule, produce statistical models, did it? So did the ONS play any part in this provision of data by SPI-M and SPI-M-O, to which you've already referred?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: We really worked hard to make sure that the statistics that we were producing and which were informative to the excellent mathematical models that were being produced in a number of centres were available as quickly as possible. So we did not produce mathematical models ourself, with one exception, but we provided statistics and made sure the data that were required were available as quickly as possible.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now just some final very short topics before we turn to the charts. Did the ONS provide directly the information used by the government in the press conferences which were held by the United Kingdom Government daily?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: We didn't always provide the information. We did, as I've indicated, really work hard with having a team embedded to make sure that the production of the graphs was of the highest standard to be able to communicate to the public what was going on.

Not all -- the data weren't all ours, but we certainly, if you like, drew most of the graphs.

**Lead Inquiry**: On the subject of devolved administrations, did the information that was provided by the ONS cover data extracted from, drawn from, the devolved administrations?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: In some part. So, for example, the Covid Infection Survey was designed UK-wide. It started in the different devolved administrations at different times, but it was a UK-wide survey, as was the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey to which you have referred in the past.

Other public health data are devolved and so those were provided by, for example, Public Health Wales or the associated institution in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did you provide mortality data by way of weekly provisions of material, weekly extracts, to Public Health England, the Joint Biosecurity Centre, SPI-M, Public Health Wales, the Welsh Government, and a number of other --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Sure, yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- national and devolved bodies?

You refer in your statement to pandemic challenges and lessons learned. You've made the point already that the ONS was keen to become engaged from as early a point as possible, in order to be able to provide data to assist the government, and you say that you did establish excellent working relationships with the government in all its many parts.

Do you advocate in your statement for the ONS to be involved in any future crisis at as early an opportunity as possible?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Absolutely. I think it's incredibly important.

I also think that the National Situation Centre, with whom we have very good relationships, needs -- and which identifies some of the national risks -- needs to have data flows ready and we need to be prepared absolutely at the beginning to get those data flows flowing.

So I think the ONS needs to be involved right at the beginning, and we stand ready, sir, to do so.

**Lead Inquiry**: You also established excellent working relationships with the devolved administrations, but did the ONS become involved in terms of the provision of data from the devolved administrations and to the devolved administrations at as early a stage as you would have liked?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: In exactly the same place as I've just think we should be involved. I have a very good relationship with the chief statisticians of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and I do think they should be properly involved at the earliest possible stage and, where appropriate, the ONS stands ready to help.

**Lead Inquiry**: You referred earlier to the conceptual methodological and practical difficulties of assembling data and of accumulating information from the general population. Were there particular challenges in receiving data from others by way of the application, or on account of the application of control of patient information notices?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Well, very quickly, I do think sharing data or being able to link data together -- I've already given one example -- has the potential to provide evidence to improve the lives of all our fellow citizens in a way that almost nothing else does, and that requires easy, ethical, privacy-enhanced data sharing.

Now, there's no legal impediment to data sharing, but there are, if you like, inherent cultural and conservative issues about, you know, "I'm a bit worried about sharing my data", people would say.

I do think during the pandemic we were able to make progress in a way that we were not able to make progress before, and the control of patient information rules were very helpful, although I would have to say on occasion it took some months longer to get access than one would want.

Most recently, though, with those stopping -- and it does seem to me not to be helpful if we can do some really important work, shall we say, on Covid, and you want to do almost the same work to look at cardiovascular disease -- we can't do that.

**Lead Inquiry**: Because of?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Because control of patient information --

**Lead Inquiry**: It's based on patient data --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: -- were about Covid.

So that is why Sir Chris Whitty and Tim Ferris from the NHS and myself have asked Professor Cathie Sudlow to do a review of the barriers to data sharing in health, because there are just so many things we can do in the future, we would argue, ethically, privacy-enhanced, with public engagement, but, critically, in the public interest, and I think we need to be able to do that better.

**Lead Inquiry**: So is it your view that in future it's of vital importance, in order to enable the swift, efficient flow of data through the ONS, that the legal and ethical and medical structures which are in place which guide access to data, such as the control of patient information notices, are made as, well, as swiftly and as easily as can be to operate?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That's absolutely right.

And it's not just about the data sharing. The Royal Society's DELVE committee suggested that, you know, analysts with the right skills could be, if you like, given a licence to enable them to access data quickly, and that is something that we would agree with. My colleague Alison Pritchard calls it "we need a green channel", with the analogy of Customs posts, and we are very much in favour of that. But, again, when I talk to data owners, they are not so keen because they are very keen to, if you like, only allow access to certain people for certain projects, when actually, as I repeat, ethically, privacy-enhanced, with public engagement, for the public good, entirely transparent, we could make an enormous amount of progress very quickly.

**Lead Inquiry**: It appears axiomatic that the ONS must be seen as a trusted voice in the United Kingdom, that the provision of data is carried out with the greatest care possible in order to ensure that it is received and understood to be accurate, so that we may all understand where we stand?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: We do not believe that it is for the public to trust us, it is for us to prove to the public that we are trustworthy. And that's a distinction that I think is important.

**Lead Inquiry**: On this subject of trustworthiness of data, did the chair of the United Kingdom Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove, have occasion, have cause to write to the then Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock MP, on 2 June 2020, about this issue of, we'll all recall, the testing data, the announcement by the government that it had reached a certain number, 100,000 in fact, tests?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: What was it that caused Sir David Norgrove to have to write to Mr Hancock?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Sir David wrote to Mr Hancock because there was a lack of operational clarity in the data that were being provided as to whether we were talking about tests that people had taken or tests that had been sent to people, or indeed the testing capacity. And Sir David said that it was incredibly important that we had clarity on exactly what was meant. Because the public would have rightly wanted to know: is this tests that have been taken or is it testing capacity?

Sir David met with Matt Hancock. I was not at that meeting, but I understand it was a very good meeting. Sir David suggested that there should be a protocol to publish regularly testing statistics. Matt Hancock agreed. And Sir David came back to me and I asked my Deputy National Statistician, Iain Bell, to develop that protocol, and it was produced and used.

**Mr Keith**: Thank you very much.

My Lady, is that a convenient moment?

**Lady Hallett**: It is. We have been going for an hour and a half since the last break, so I think a break is probably welcome to many. I shall return at 1.45.

*(12.46 pm)*

*(The short adjournment)*

*(1.45 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Keith.

**Mr Keith**: Professor, we turn now to your additional witness statement and the particular datasets that you've kindly provided, dealing with such issues such as mortality, excess deaths, infections, Long Covid, and the social impacts of Covid-19 on particular groups.

You provided for us -- could we have, please, page 5 -- an executive summary which broadly encapsulates, does it not, the charts, the tables and the data which follow?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just to run through them, please, one by one, at (a), what is your finding in relation to the figures, the data taken from the death certificates?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That there were 186,668 deaths involving Covid-19 between March 2020 and February 2022 and, for the reasons that I've indicated earlier, there were no death registrations involving Covid in January or February 2020.

And we calculate something called "excess deaths", where we look at the number of deaths in any time period over and above the average in the previous five years, and we would say that during this period there were 138,909 excess deaths, in other words deaths over and above that which we would have expected, all things being equal, in that period.

**Lead Inquiry**: (b), do the death certificates provide the sex of the deceased, enabling you to work out mortality rates between men and women?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, they do, and we demonstrate a marked trend that men were more likely, sadly, to have been impacted than women.

**Lead Inquiry**: And were mortality rates, as we all know very well indeed, highest in the oldest age groups?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Very much so. Significantly so. And of course that, given that with old age comes an increasing probability of disability, the two are quite interlinked.

**Lead Inquiry**: (c), did nine out of ten deaths involving Covid in England occur in a hospital or care home?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, they did.

**Lead Inquiry**: What about the position with private homes? Generally speaking, were the numbers of deaths in private homes quite small?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: From Covid-19. So around about, we would say, 40% or 30% of deaths occur in private homes, but with regard to Covid deaths, this was around 6%. So most people who sadly died of Covid would have done so either having gone into hospital or were in a care home.

**Lead Inquiry**: Of course, they could have contracted -- they could have acquired or become infected with Covid either before or during their residency in hospital or a care home?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Exactly so, and there was a lot of discussion over the period certainly of the first couple of waves of nosocomial infection.

**Lead Inquiry**: (d), did the majority of Covid-19 deaths in England occur among disabled people?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes. And that again, as I indicated, was due to the association between old age and disability.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was that link between disability and old age and death prevalent or in existence even after accounting for factors such as socio-economic and demographic characteristics and vaccination status?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: (e), having applied a higher aged standardised approach, what is that, succinctly, please, Professor?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: What we do is we look at the mortality rate, that's the number of deaths divided by the number of people to whom that could have occurred, but we then control to make sure that we are comparing, if you like, apples with apples, by saying we will have one age distribution. Because if the people in one occupation were all in their 20s and the people in another occupation -- I exaggerate -- were all in their 60s, then you would expect it was the age distribution that was impacting that rate rather than the true difference. And so we control in what we call an age-standardised rate for differences in the age distribution of people with different, in this case, occupations.

**Lead Inquiry**: Does that approach also apply and did you apply it to other categories of groups, such as age groups, because there happen to be fewer 90-year olds in the population than there are 60 and 70 and 80-year olds, and so if you produce a chart showing the absolute numbers, it's not in fact representative of the degree of death in that cohort?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: No, that's right, if you look it up, absolute numbers simply tell you the numbers you need. I would suggest to use rates, and those rates can either be what we call age-specific, so for a particular age, but if you want to compare two sets of characteristics, then you need to standardise the age distributions, so that you are comparing like age distributions.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did that age-standardised approach demonstrate that mortality rates were higher amongst groups associated with transport and mobile machine drivers and operatives and elementary administration and service occupations? And we'll come back a little later to describing what those were.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: (f):

"Many people ... reported ongoing symptoms after infection, known as Long Covid."

Did your data show the highest rates of self-reported Long Covid amongst adults aged 35 to 69 also amongst women and also those living in more deprived areas and amongst disabled people?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

Now, just moving quickly through some, I promise you not all, of the charts and the tables that you've provided, could we have, please, the first page of the document I produced during the opening, in the Inquiry pack, INQ000283367.

Professor, this chart is familiar to us, it's a chart which I introduced earlier during the opening. Does it show, in essence, the particular nature of the waves, wave 1 and what you describe as wave 2?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: It certainly gives you daily deaths by those first two waves. What I would also add is it shows that in subsequent waves there was much lower mortality.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, you've actually described in your statement the emergence of Alpha and Delta.

Alpha was, generally speaking, from January 2021 to June 2021. Delta was June 2021 to January 2022. What was the impact, in general terms, upon daily deaths?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Well, Alpha, as the graph in front of you shows, had a really significant peak of daily deaths. There was then Beta, which, although there were a number of multiple introductions, didn't really take hold in this country. And then Delta came in the autumn of 2021, and while there were significant amount -- there was a significant amount of positivity, you will see that there were much lower levels of mortality.

We have said (a) that as the different variants came through, they tended to be more transmissible but less likely to cause death, but, at the same time, by Delta the vaccine programme had really been operationalised, and I would argue that the vaccine programme also had a strong impact on reducing the number of deaths.

It's worth saying that the level of positivity in the autumn of 2021 and the winter of 2021 was much higher than we had seen before.

**Lead Inquiry**: Daily deaths is of course one way of examining the impact of the pandemic. Another way is reported infection.

Could we have page 5 of this document. Because, in the early stages, there was no effective means of reporting infection, because there was no established scaled-up testing process, does this chart, which reports infection, show, therefore, very low levels of reported infection during the early days, the first wave, and only really showing the full extent of the infection latterly?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Page 6, the next page. Is that an ONS infection survey which estimates the true level of infection by way of estimates of positive tests, but again it relies upon the positive tests, and showing the massive impact of the Omicron wave latterly?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Exactly so. And I would note the arrows on the left, which were when the surveys for different countries started.

**Lead Inquiry**: Could we please turn to page 12 next of your second statement. That's INQ000271436, and table 3.

Did you apply the age-standardised approach to the mortality rates for deaths involving Covid by lockdown periods across the United Kingdom by reference to males and females?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that the genesis, therefore, of your executive summary to the effect that the pandemic impacted to a considerably greater extent upon males than females?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: In, please, now, the document prepared over the weekend, the pack, does this show the number of death registrations by five-year age group? So --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, it does. In addition, it shows the age-specific mortality rate which I referred to earlier, so that you have both, and it shows very clearly that, very sadly, the great majority of deaths occurred to older people.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did you apply the age-standardised approach to the bar chart, or is that absolute --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: No, the bar chart --

**Lead Inquiry**: -- figures, or to the dotted line?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: No, the bar chart is just the numbers of deaths. The dotted line here is the rate for each five-year group, and calculated and reported and then a curve driven through it.

**Lead Inquiry**: Does this chart therefore enable you to work out the greater risk of death at, for example, 90, because if 0.3 persons per 100,000 people at the age of 13 died from Covid, that can be compared to the number of persons per 100,000 persons at the age of 90, working out that there is a 10,000 or so greater risk of a 90-year old dying of Covid than a 13-year old?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: The next chart I want to take you to, please, is back in your statement, the additional statement, table 5. Does this show, Professor, death registrations across the whole of the United Kingdom but divided by country and region, showing, again, the age standardised mortality rate for each of those regions as well as each of the nations? Page 15.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, it does.

**Lead Inquiry**: So the United Kingdom has an age-standardised mortality rate of 143.2, but the highest country in the United Kingdom is actually England at 145?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Followed by Wales at 144.6, Northern Ireland at 130.7, at the bottom of the chart, and Scotland are the lowest?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: And I would advise that, particularly between England and Wales, that the difference is not significant enough to be seen as a difference.

**Lead Inquiry**: But if you look at the regions, we can see that there's a very significant difference between the age-standardised mortality rate for London, at 192.1, and, for example, Yorkshire and the Humber, 151.4?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: And more markedly even than that, the southwest?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, very much so.

And I think it is important just to add on that particular point, the southwest does have the older population, and I think that's worth saying that's why we need to age-standardise the rates.

**Lead Inquiry**: Going now to the pack, INQ000292765, and your evidence earlier on the distinction between death in homes, hospitals, care homes and other places, does this chart -- when we get to it, page 5 -- demonstrate what you were saying earlier, which is that the majority of deaths occurred in hospitals and care homes, taken together? We can see there the blue line for home, the orange line for hospital and the grey line for care homes.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, it does, and it shows a number of points. You will see a very big peak for care homes in that first wave, and I think it is really important to note that. Secondly, the two peaks that are there for hospitals, and that is -- and that that moves away as the vaccine programme comes in. Thirdly, that in private homes the number of excess deaths stays high throughout the period and, while there are a variety of reasons for that, I would -- it is important to point out cardiovascular illness as being very high, as causing deaths in private homes over and above those we would have expected.

The expectation --

**Lead Inquiry**: Sorry to interrupt, because this is of course, I emphasise, the number of excess deaths --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: These are excess deaths.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- not deaths from Covid?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Not at all. These are excess deaths from all causes. Zero means the number of deaths would be the same as we would have expected from the previous five years for that particular week, and a positive number more, a negative number actually less than we might have expected.

**Lead Inquiry**: Why, in your view, does the orange line for hospital go below the absolute line of zero in the summer of 2020 and the early part of 2021?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: There are a number of potential reasons. One reason, of course, is that people were being somewhat more healthy. For example, we didn't have a flu season, as it is called, in the second winter.

In addition, some -- I mean, it's very sad to say so, but some of those people who died from Covid might subsequently have died in hospital anyway, and this -- it's very sad to note that, but it is hard to give an authoritative view. There are many potential reasons why that might have come, and one would need to look in much greater detail at the causes.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

Can we then go back to page 2 in this document, which gives us age-standardised mortality rates of deaths involving Covid-19 for those aged 10 to 100 years by ethnic group and sex.

Does this show that once you apply the age-standardised approach, therefore taking account of the absolute numbers in the population of persons defined by ethnic group, the age-standardised mortality rate was significantly higher for, firstly, all non-white groups than the white British group, and secondly, it was highest overall for those of Bangladeshi ethnicity?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I would just qualify that briefly, if I may.

You're absolutely right, but in the first wave the highest group was actually for people from black African and black Caribbean backgrounds, and I would argue that some of that explanation could be due to the geography of the first and second wave. The second wave was much more in the northwest and north of England, and less so, initially, in London.

**Lead Inquiry**: It shows, of course, therefore, also the very distinct differences between the impact of the waves. So --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- for those of Bangladeshi ethnicity, there is a very stark difference between the first and second wave, and then the Alpha wave, and similarly in relation to those of Pakistani ethnicity, and then also you can see the very distinct difference between male and female?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I completely agree.

**Lead Inquiry**: Had the ONS carried out previous analysis in relation to ethnicity and the impact of the pandemic?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: This was the first analysis that we did, and we did it by linking these -- these data come by linking death registration to 2011 census data to be able to get ethnicity. We then subsequently linked in other data to be able to ask the question of the extent to which these stark differences could be explained by different ethnic groups as a group -- I mean, clearly there's heterogenity flying around, but, as a group, having -- living in more disadvantaged surroundings, being more disadvantaged in more socio-economic occupations, for example, which were much more likely to be public facing, where the degree of positivity would have been higher.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was the ONS able to draw any general conclusions, therefore, as to the link between ethnicity and socio-economic conditions? So, when you put it another way, that the mortality rate was, therefore, affected not simply by the fact of ethnicity, but by the socio-economic conditions, deprivation, housing or poverty, experienced by members of that particular ethnic group?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: The socio-economic conditions, the lower dis -- the lower levels of advantage. Also, as I indicated, for those who were of working age, the higher likelihood to be in public-facing occupations.

In addition, we showed that for women of some ethnic heritages, living in a multi-occupied household had a real impact. And then the other point we note as we move into the later waves was differences in vaccine uptake played a real role in the probability of mortality.

**Lead Inquiry**: Could we go back to page 3 in this document. Did you in fact produce data showing mortality rate, therefore, by deprivation?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: And the greater degree of deprivation, the greater the mortality rate?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: These -- what we do is we use a number of indicators, which we add together for small geographic areas, and then we link the death registration to the geographic area, and as you indicated we've got the address that we can get from the death registration, and what that shows is a very straight gradient between people in the most deprived areas having the highest levels of mortality and people in the least deprived areas having the lowest. And as you rightly say, these are standardised so that we control for differences in the age distribution which may occur between those areas.

**Lead Inquiry**: If we then go forward one page to page 4 in this document, did the ONS also provide, by way of self-reported information by disabled persons describing whether they were limited a lot in their disability or limited a little in their disability, on the mortality rates by disability status?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, we did, and this graph shows that. I would just add that, if anything, it might be an underestimate, because we get -- this is self-reported disability from the 2011 census and therefore it is possible that people may have become disabled in the interim period.

**Lead Inquiry**: If we could then go, please, back to your second statement, INQ000271436, at page 34, we come to the issue of occupation group. You will recall that you referred earlier to protective service occupations and other operatives, transport and mobile machine drivers and operatives. Applying the age-standardised mortality rate approach, were there some occupations which had a markedly higher mortality rate and therefore, by implication, a higher risk of death?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, there were, and these tended to be public-facing type jobs, so, for example, when we talk about transport, we're talking about taxi drivers and bus drivers --

**Lead Inquiry**: Could we go forward one page, please, and we will see transport and mobile machine drivers and operatives at 82.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: And when we talk about protective services, that's largely the police and security and things like that.

**Lead Inquiry**: So -- thank you for highlighting 82 -- the highest standardised rate was for transport and mobile machine drivers and operatives, at 78.7.

By contrast, if you go back one page, health professionals, health and social care associate professionals, had lower rates of mortality, 22.2 and 32.6.

Why do you think that they had an age-standardised lower mortality rate even though they were in the health and care sectors?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: What we show is that they had a relatively high rate of contracting Covid in other data, but that the relatively lower levels of mortality, at this stage -- I mean, I'm a statistician, so I apologise if my knowledge of epidemiology is not brilliant, but much -- in many ways, better protection, much higher levels of vaccine uptake would be a really -- and early vaccine uptake -- would be important factors.

**Lead Inquiry**: What about barrier care, so the more prevalent use of PPE and so on?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That's certainly an impact, but as I indicated there were relatively high levels of Covid uptake amongst some health professionals.

**Lead Inquiry**: So there was a high risk of infection, notwithstanding the use of PPE as one --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yeah, we were --

**Lead Inquiry**: -- would say?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: You have those in another table.

**Lead Inquiry**: But the levels of mortality were lower --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Were relatively low.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- perhaps because of a greater take-up of vaccination?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Exactly so.

**Lead Inquiry**: Could we go, please, to page 10 in this document. We then come on to the -- sorry, not in that document, I do apologise, in the pack document, INQ000292765.

Did the ONS produce for the Inquiry, in fact over the weekend, some international comparisons -- so it's page 10 of this document, please. Thank you.

If you could scroll out so we can get the whole chart, international comparisons between a number of different countries, showing where the United Kingdom is in terms of all-cause mortality, that's to say all deaths not just Covid, but also the difference between the numbers of excess deaths during the pandemic and the pre-existing position?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, these are from a publication that we have put out and which uses, again, a standardised population. So we control everything to a standard European population, and what it shows -- and I would concentrate on the -- it's ranked by the blue dots, and what it shows is the relative -- the proportion to which the mortality rate for a particular country was bigger than the average, and what you see is that in Central Europe in particular, and then in Italy, the rates were much higher. And then largely in Scandinavia the rates much, much lower.

The other point I think it is important to refer to on international comparisons, which we report in a number of publications, is that the UK, and particularly England, was one of the very few countries in the first wave to have a national epidemic. So if we were, for example, to look at Italy, Italy had much higher levels of mortality than we did around Bergamo, in northern Italy, for example, but almost none at all in the south of Italy. The same in France, where we show that the French first wave epidemic was largely around Paris and Strasbourg, whereas in England the epidemic came right the way through the country.

And that's why I do think what we have reported elsewhere in a series of papers is we divide areas into what are called NUTS regions, that's regions of around about 200,000 population, and when we do that, we are able to see much closer the granularity of mortality, and in those data we show that regions or areas, for example, in London, the highest in the first wave was Brent, are -- that those areas are -- well, regions are a much better level of granularity to look at than nation states.

**Lead Inquiry**: Okay, thank you, that's very helpful.

And you should make clear, shouldn't you, Professor, that this is a chart of comparative excess deaths, so all these countries have produced excess death figures that you have been able to draw upon, but of course the rates of mortality in any given country will depend on a multitude of factors --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- such as population age, resilience, socio-economic conditions, health, and so on and so forth?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That's right, which is why we have controlled for the age distributions.

**Lady Hallett**: If you wanted to compare the UK with other countries, this would be a better way of doing it, because we don't know how other countries necessarily recorded deaths from Covid?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Exactly so.

**Lady Hallett**: Yes.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: There is some variation in the recording, and that is why we have always used excess all-cause deaths, and you can see particularly in the first wave a very strong correlation in England between excess all-cause deaths and reported Covid deaths.

**Mr Keith**: At pages 8 and 9 of that document, finally, do you produce figures -- thank you -- for Glasgow, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast and the United Kingdom average, and then changes in mortality rate in England, thereby showing the different rates of mortality across the United Kingdom and across England?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Do they show in relation to the top chart in general terms a broad similarity of line, of graph, reflective of course of the waves, but if you go to the bottom chart, please, that's to say page 9, we can see in relation to October 2020 to February 2021, for London, a very considerable dip during that period, and also, between October 2020 and June 2021, relatively speaking, much higher figures for Birmingham than for the Manchester or London areas.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That is right, and that speaks to the point I made earlier about geography, where the first wave very much, you know, right across but in London in particular, the second wave, in that autumn of 2020, you may recall the outbreak in Leicester, you may recall some of the outbreaks across the northwest, very sadly, and indeed that crescent, which more or less starts in Liverpool, goes through the north and then down to Leicester, was very much where that second wave came, and that is reflected by London having a relatively lower level there.

**Lead Inquiry**: That wave or crescent of mortality sweeping through that part of England, is that in any way redolent of past infections or disease --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: If you were to look at --

**Lead Inquiry**: -- rates in the united Kingdom?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I mean, look, if you were to look at a map, if you were to make a map of the geography, shall we say, of infant mortality in the 19th century, it would not look unlike that, I would have to say. So it is -- we have parts of our country that have long-lasting levels of ill health and the -- and everything around ill health.

**Lead Inquiry**: You, finally, address in your statement the issue of Long Covid. I've already asked you some questions on that, but at page 7 of this document do you produce figures for persons estimated to be experiencing symptoms of Long Covid, showing the absolute very large numbers of persons estimated to be suffering from Long Covid?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes, we do. This slide shows people experiencing symptoms for at least four weeks. We also published data which shows people experiencing symptoms for at least 12 weeks. And a point I would like to make is that as we get closer to where we are now, the difference between people suffering for four weeks and 12 weeks becomes very, very small. In other words, people who are experiencing, very sadly, Long Covid are experiencing it for a long time.

**Lead Inquiry**: And are continuing to experience it?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Exactly so.

**Mr Keith**: Thank you very much.

Professor, those are all the questions that I have for you.

**Lady Hallett**: I have provisionally agreed and I confirm, Mr Weatherby, you have some questions, I think, followed by Ms Shepherd thereafter. Mr Weatherby.

Questions From Mr Weatherby KC

**Mr Weatherby**: Thank you.

Professor, I ask questions on behalf of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice group, which represents many bereaved families from across the UK, just a few questions.

I'm going to return to a point that was touched upon before lunch by Mr Keith, and that's correspondence between Sir David Norgrove and Matt Hancock.

So Sir David was the chair of the UKSA, you were the chief -- you are the chief executive, Matt Hancock at the time Secretary of State for Health.

Mr Keith touched upon a letter of 2 June of 2020, and it's right, isn't it, that that was a published letter and you're aware of it?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Very much so. That is the policy of Sir --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: -- well, the chair, if there is an issue that wishes to be raised then a public letter is written.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes, openness and transparency.

I'm going to put it up in a moment, so I'll just give the reference, but I don't need it up quite yet, INQ000237314.

Now, for the reasons of time, we haven't included the chain of the correspondence, but this is a letter of correspondence that started on 11 May of 2020, and each of the letters, as you've just helpfully explained, and the responses are published on the UKSA website, and they're there to be seen.

Again, for context, the correspondence was regarding Mr Hancock's 100,000 tests per day target by the end of April for testing, and 200,000 tests per day target by the end of May. So that's the context.

I'll take you, as I say, to the key passages in a moment. But the correspondence that culminated in this letter was raising significant concerns about the government's presentation of the testing data, wasn't it?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: And it's significant, isn't it, that the chair sought to write to the Secretary of State; that underlines how important this was?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: We saw -- I mean, Sir David saw this as really important, that the public were fully aware --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: -- of accurate data that were transparent, to use your words.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes. Thank you.

Let's just go to the key parts of that, if we may, if we can just have it up on the screen, and the first page, bold type, Sir David Norgrove's response, so that indicates it's part of this correspondence, and it's dated 2 June.

Then the second page, if we can jump to that, please, is the subsequent -- so I'm just going to read the start of it, I'm not going to read the whole letter out, but:

"Dear Secretary of State,

"Thank you for your letter of 27 May, in which you described some welcome, though limited, additions to the official data on COVID-19 tests, including a proposed note on methods (not yet published ...). I am afraid though that the figures are still far from complete and comprehensible.

"Statistics on testing perhaps serve two main purposes.

"The first is to help us understand the epidemic, alongside the ONS survey, showing us how many people are infected, or not, and their relevant characteristics.

"The second purpose is to help manage the test programme, to ensure there are enough tests, that they are carried out or sent where they are needed and that they are being used as effectively as possible. The data should tell the public how effectively the testing programme is being managed."

Yes? Then this:

"The way the data are analysed and presented currently gives them limited value for the first purpose. The aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding. It is also hard to believe the statistics work to support the testing programme itself. The statistics and analysis serve neither purpose well."

Yes? I'll read on in a minute, but where we're up to at the moment, Sir David is highlighting the proper purpose of the data; yes?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I would suggest that Sir David's letter is clear and comprehensible.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes, thank you. And he's pointing out that the way it's being presented to the public is not fulfilling either of those purposes but is being used for another purpose, to simply show the largest possible number of tests. Yes? That's clear and comprehensible from that --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That's what Sir David is saying.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes. And you agree with that?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I think it's a fair statement.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes. I'll just read on slightly further.

"To mention just a few issues ..."

Just the first bullet point there:

"- the headline total of tests adds together tests carried out with tests posted out. This distinction is too often elided during the presentation at the daily press conference, where the relevant figure may misleadingly be described simply as the number of tests carried out. There are no data on how many of the tests posted out are in fact then successfully completed. The slides used in the daily press conference do not show the date when the tests were carried out."

So am I right that in fact what's happening is that the number of tests that is being presented to the public is misleading because it adds two different pieces of data together?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: That's what Sir David is saying.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

Jumping to the third bullet point, just the last sentence of that, the consequence -- or one of the consequences:

"This presentation gives an artificially low impression of the proportion of tests returning a positive diagnosis."

So on the one hand there is an inflated figure of the number of tests carried out, and one of the consequences is that there is an artificially low impression of the actual positive diagnoses?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I mean, that's a reasonable -- I mean, it assumes that those tests that weren't carried out will have the same probability of a positive test as those --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: -- that were carried out, so there's an assumption in the arithmetic but the --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: -- arithmetic's absolutely --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: I follow that, but that's the two effects that --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: -- Sir David is trying to get over.

Then jumping to the third page finally, just two short passages from there and it's the paragraph below the bullet point:

"I warmly welcome of course your support for the Code of Practice for Statistics."

Now, that relates to the earlier correspondence where the integrity of statistics had been made clear between the two of them:

"But the testing statistics still fall well short of its expectations. It is not surprising that given their inadequacy data on testing are so widely criticised and often mistrusted."

So here Sir David is making clear to the Secretary of State how very important this matter is; yes?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: And finally, just for completeness, the final paragraph:

"I do understand the pressures that those concerned have faced and still face. But I am sure you would agree that good evidence, trusted by the public, is essential to success in containing the virus."

Yes?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Absolutely.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: And you'd agree with that?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yeah.

**Mr Weatherby**: Yes, thank you very much, that's all I want to ask.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Weatherby.

Yes, Ms Shepherd.

**Ms Shepherd**: My Lady, before we came into court, I understand that those who represent FEHMO wanted to ask some questions. I'm happy for them to go first and, if we've got time, to come to me.

**Lady Hallett**: I don't think I've given --

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, may I assist, Mr Thomas KC approached me during lunch and said would I go back to the issue of Professor Diamond's evidence where he said there were good reasons for not having ethnicity on registration of death certificates and he wondered whether we would return to that issue.

I indicated on account of the time that I probably wouldn't, so I suspect that what he is really doing is making a section 10(4) application ex post facto in order to return to that point.

**Professor Sir Diamond**: I'm happy to briefly --

**Lady Hallett**: Well, can you explain the reason? You said there was --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: -- good reason for not --

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Well, this is -- my view is that it is -- you should minimise what is on a death certificate for the very simple reason that the person who most understands the answer is sadly no longer with us, and therefore you are going to have -- you are going to have errors coming into the data that you cannot control for.

That is why I am completely in support of the current proposals that are being made around the legislation which will bring ethnicity, using the full census definition or census categorisations, into National Health Service data, and then those National Health Service data can be lifted into death registration, using the kinds of linkage that I've talked about before, and that will give us absolutely top class data.

So, just for clarity, I am very much in favour of having ethnic differentials of mortality calculated and published regularly, and we at ONS would very much like to do that, but I just think it is better that the person who sadly is no longer with us has the opportunity to provide that information and then we add it later, rather than we try to bring in errors -- data that can be subject to errors that we can't control.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

I hope that answers FEHMO's questions.

**Mr Dayle**: I believe it does, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

Ms Shepherd.

Questions From Ms Shepherd

**Ms Shepherd**: Thank you, my Lady.

Professor Diamond, I appear on behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru.

You have already been asked by Counsel to the Inquiry about the extent to which ONS data were gathered from the devolved administrations. I want to ask specifically about the Covid-19 insights tool which was for the benefit and information of the public.

Were data from Wales or any other of the devolved administrations incorporated into this tool?

**Professor Sir Diamond**: Thank you for that question. The answer is: yes, they were. Where they were -- well, they were incorporated directly where ONS collected the data in a UK-wide basis. So the Coronavirus Infection Survey, the CIS that we've talked about previously, and the opinions survey which we've talked about previously, collected UK-wide data and the data were made available through that tool.

Where data were collected explicitly in a devolved administration, for example some of the mortality data, we provide on the insights tool a link to where you could get those data. So if you were interested in Welsh data, there is a link to where those Welsh data are published but we do not publish them, if you like, as one UK-wide data.

**Ms Shepherd**: Thank you, Professor.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Shepherd.

Thank you very much, Sir Ian, it's very kind of you, and I won't say I got excited by the statistics -- I can never say the word -- but you certainly made it extremely interesting and very informative.

**The Witness**: Well, thank you for the huge privilege, thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Also I heard a number of references by Mr Keith to work done over the weekend. I hope we haven't imposed too great a burden on you.

**The Witness**: We always work over the weekend at the Office of National Statistics.

**Lady Hallett**: Good. Good advert. Well done, thank you.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: Mr O'Connor.

**Mr O'Connor**: My Lady, may we now please call Gavin Freeguard.
