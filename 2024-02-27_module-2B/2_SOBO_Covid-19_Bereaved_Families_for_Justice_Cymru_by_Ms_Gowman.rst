2. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru by Ms Gowman
=====================================================================================

**Ms Gowman**: Thank you, my Lady.

Prynhawn da a chroeso i Gymru, good afternoon and welcome to Wales, my Lady. I appear on behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru.

12,510, the number of deaths registered in Wales where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate as at 2 February 2024. Countless lives lost and so many more shattered. Against this context, the Welsh bereaved are still fighting for truth, justice and accountability.

Module 2B will scrutinise the Welsh Government pandemic response. During the pandemic, the Welsh Government asserted its right to do things differently using its devolved powers, it claims to have adopted an evidence-based approach to pandemic response measures tailored to Wales. The Cymru group has significant misgivings and considers that harmful mistakes were made.

Any government would be hard pressed to match the shocking display of arrogance and central government toxicity within Westminster at that crucial time, however the Inquiry must guard against unhelpful comparisons. The Westminster yardstick sets the bar particularly low. The Welsh Government must be judged not solely by comparison to what was happening in Westminster but by its own standards, its own evidence, by what it knew and when.

This module is particularly important for the Cymru group, as it remains bitterly disappointed that despite repeated calls from the Welsh bereaved and political community, the Welsh Government has refused to open itself to scrutiny by establishing a Wales-specific inquiry. The Welsh Government has established a special purpose committee to supplement the work of the UK Inquiry, however it lacks teeth and has been likened by one of its own members to using a sticking plaster to treat a bad wound. The Cymru group considers that the Welsh Government seeks to thwart a granular inspection of Welsh decision-making, seeking instead to hide behind and deflect blame onto the UK Government, and within this context it is very much welcomed that this Inquiry will shine a spotlight on the decision-making in Wales and will do its utmost to investigate and analyse fully and fairly the most significant issues impacting Wales.

The Inquiry's ongoing commitment to facilitating the participation of the Welsh bereaved is also welcomed. The decisions made by Welsh Government must be understood through the lived experiences of the Welsh people. The Welsh bereaved saw first-hand consequences of deficiencies in preparedness and response. They witnessed individual and systemic failures as Covid-19 spread like wildfire through hospitals and care homes, fuelled by derisory testing regimes and inadequate PPE. The voices of the bereaved in Wales must, have and will continue to be heard in the powerful testimony to come.

Some of the most insightful evidence, my Lady, in Module 2 came from contemporaneous informal communications such as WhatsApp and text message. The Welsh Government claims to have disclosed all material within its possession. However, the disclosed material, we say, is belated and dubiously limited. Some in Welsh Government deny the use of informal communication for government business, but this does not ring true or bear scrutiny. Others claim that messages were simply deleted. This is questionable and contrary to the words of the First Minister's official spokesman who said to the press on 7 November 2023 that staff were regularly reminded of the need to maintain and retain robust records relating to decisions taken throughout the pandemic.

The limited messages that have been disclosed clearly show WhatsApp and text messages used to discuss government business where they shouldn't have been. They show Welsh Government's senior special advisers suspiciously and systemically deleting communications. They show special advisers reminding themselves and others that they had agreed "to clear out WhatsApp chat once a week". They show Jane Runeckles, the most senior special adviser for the First Minister for Wales, and Vaughan Gething, Minister for Health, turning on disappearing messages. They show that despite asserting to the Senedd that he did not use WhatsApp, Mr Drakeford was regularly using WhatsApp to discuss policy, announcements and even to seek clarification on the rules. This beggars belief.

The Welsh bereaved look forward to hearing how the Welsh Government justify the use of informal communications for government business, and to understand why full access to all informal communication has not been made available to allow for full scrutiny of policy discussions and decision-making via this forum.

On science and modelling, TAG, TAC and its subgroups were established "not to re-create all the SAGE mechanisms but to allow us to just simply translate the implications of that into the Welsh context". Was SAGE's English-centric focus justifiable? And was the establishment of TAG and TAC necessary and effective in achieving its aims?

Documents disclosed to the Inquiry point to deficiencies in respect of TAG and TAC, with concerns raised in respect of independence, expertise, capacity and co-ordination. Disclosure from one subgroup suggests that the engagement with TAG was never really formalised and the commissioning of work was almost completely informal and haphazard. Many requests were verbal and responding to some specific point, with almost a knee jerk or panic flavour to them.

Further, it is suggested that Wales struggled to have its voice heard at UK scientific fora, a small fish in a larger pond. And what impact did that have?

The Inquiry should also examine the interface between science advice and policy. Did policymakers ask the right questions, and were they able to effectively translate scientific advice into robust policies? The Cymru group is concerned to read that there has only been a low level of challenge from policy teams to scientific advice, which suggests a sign of policy weakness.

Finally on this topic, it is also of real concern that at the start of the pandemic the disclosure suggests that Wales did not have any modelling capability, leading to over-reliance on SPI-M models, notwithstanding the "poor fit" for Wales.

Did Welsh Government act quickly to identify modelling needs and mobilise expertise? If not, what impact did this have on the Welsh Government's response? There must be close scrutiny of the Welsh Government's early response to the threat of the virus, including whether valuable time was lost in January, February and March 2020.

The Inquiry heard in Module 2 that by late January 2020, and by 4 February at the very latest, the UK Government should have been electrified into action, and the Welsh Government should equally have been so electrified.

On the contrary, the disclosure suggests that the Welsh Government's initial response was slow, chaotic and disjointed, notwithstanding clear evidence that the NHS in Wales was imminently to become overwhelmed. The CTI has stated that the evidence suggests that during February 2020 the virus was not a priority for the Welsh Government, and the Cymru group agrees. The observations of Public Health Wales' then lead strategic director are also telling. He states:

"What I think was missing in the first few weeks from 8 January 2020 when I first became aware to 20 February 2020 when the [Health and Social Services Group] Coronavirus Planning and Response Group first met, was national strategic leadership and co-ordination from Welsh government."

A view also seemingly echoed by the Chief Scientific Adviser for Health.

After the first case in Wales was reported on 28 February 2020, the disclosure suggests that the response continued to be slow and the Welsh Government, led by the nose of a clumsy UK Government, failed to act with focus and speed required to anticipate and prepare for the interventions that became necessary. Armed with scientific data, it was open to the Welsh Government as a devolved administration to act sooner. Why didn't it? Why did it blindly follow the UK Government in a case of the blind leading the blind?

Why, for example, was the Welsh Government so slow to ban mass gatherings, declining to cancel the Wales versus Scotland rugby match and two Stereophonics concerts in mid-March, despite the increasing rates of community transmission evident at that time?

Third, what were the consequences of inadequate early response? The disclosure suggests that by reason of the Welsh Government's deficient response it was deprived of precious time to armour up for battle, to prepare the interventions required. During this lost time, decision-makers in Wales could and should have been liaising with key partners, establishing effective consultative fora, and formulating co-produced plans on a whole range of non-pharmaceutical interventions, including track, trace and isolate and PPE, and bolstering the fragmented health and social care sector against the foreseeable demands to be placed on it.

Finally, leading the charge on the pandemic was the First Minister for Wales, his Cabinet and his special advisers. In Wales, we have a saying, [Welsh spoken], which translates to "A man without prudence is a ship without an anchor". The Inquiry will consider whether this First Minister effectively steered the Welsh ship through the pandemic storm, and did the Cabinet and special advisers serve him well as his second mate. The Cymru group is unconvinced, perturbed instead by its perception of chaos.

Moving on to transmission, the Cymru group asks the Inquiry to examine the evidence which was available at all stages of the pandemic in relation to asymptomatic and :outline:`airborne transmission`. The disclosure is clear that as early as 28 January 2020, SAGE and in turn the Chief Scientific Adviser for Wales, were aware of asymptomatic transmission. The Cymru group wishes to understand the steps which could and should have been taken from that moment on.

Mr Drakeford in his witness statement states that there needed to be sufficiency of evidence before operational decisions could be based on it. In the absence of certainty on asymptomatic transmission, but in the context of clear risk evidence, decision-makers could and should have erred on the side of caution. And I note, my Lady, that this was an argument traversed at length in Module 2, and Mr Drakeford's observations in that regard didn't hold up to scrutiny.

The failure to heed the risk is unacceptable. One area where the failure to acknowledge risk of asymptomatic transmission had devastating consequences in Wales was in respect of the decision taken to discharge people from hospital into care homes without testing. The accounts of the bereaved are stark. One member of the Cymru group states:

"My father, and others, were discharged from hospital to care homes across the borough to make room for anticipated Covid patients. None of these people who were discharged were tested."

In respect of discharge to care homes, guidance issued in Wales on 8 April 2020 raised that negative tests were not required prior to transfers or admissions into the residential setting. Thus essentially endorsing the discharge of potentially infectious asymptomatic and symptomatic patients into care homes. The Welsh Government's eventual decisions on 22 and 29 April 2020 to firstly test everybody being discharged to a care home and, later, to provide step-down facilities for those who had tested positive, was a change that came later in Wales than in England.

Similarly, the decision to extend testing to all staff and residents in care homes was not taken until 16 May 2020, again slower than the other three nations. Why did Welsh Government delay in changing its policies to factor in the risks of asymptomatic transmission? Did the Welsh Government give thought to the likelihood of the rapid spread of the virus amongst the most vulnerable? The perception of the Cymru group is that the delay was akin to a death warrant for the elderly, and a stark message from the Welsh Government that they did not matter.

A further area which saw similarly disastrous consequences was in respect of the failure to provide timely testing for healthcare workers. One Cymru member states:

"My father caught Covid while in hospital. The nursing staff were quite open about the circumstances -- the nurses had gone to work thinking they had a cold, when really they had Covid."

Next the Cymru group asks the Inquiry to scrutinise the issue of :outline:`airborne transmission`. The evidence from Module 2 established that the possibility of :outline:`Covid-19 being airborne should have been recognised from an early stage`. Given what was known, the Cymru group states that :outline:`stronger measures should have been taken at an early stage to mitigate against the risk of airborne transmission`, including public messaging, guidance, targeted NPIs, for example :outline:`mandating the use of FFP2 and FFP3 masks for healthcare workers`. Did Welsh Government decision-making accurately reflect the scientific understanding of transmission as it unfolded and adequately mitigate the risks? If not, why not?

Next, the events of autumn 2020. In the face of mounting concerns regarding the increasing prevalence of the virus on 21 September 2020, SAGE recommended a firebreak. What followed was an unacceptable delay by the Welsh Government in the face of failed lockdowns, as it ignored TAC warnings and unjustifiably dragged its feet, with the announcement of a firebreak eventually being made almost one month later on 19 October.

Welsh Government had again let cases get too high before imposing a lockdown. Did it learn nothing from wave 1?

The Welsh Government appears to blame the UK Government funding decisions for the delay but there is clear evidence to refute this suggestion which we hope will be put to witnesses.

Further, the group wishes to understand why the restrictions introduced following the autumn firebreak were, in the words of Wales' Chief Scientific Adviser for Health, "insufficient to control the growth of the epidemic". What controls should have been put in place and why weren't they?

There are many areas of divergence in non-pharmaceutical interventions between the Welsh Government and the UK Government, for example on testing, :outline:`face coverings`, circuit-breakers and relaxation of restrictions. The bereaved want to understand the justification for Welsh Government divergent decision-making when the core science was the same.

Further, crucial decisions made by the Welsh Government such as on testing and :outline:`face coverings`, as I've already indicated, were made later than the corresponding decisions in the rest of the UK. Why? And in particular, the bereaved want to see the rationale for not mandating low harm precautionary measures such as :outline:`mask wearing` at an earlier stage robustly challenged.

There was also significant scope for confusion, disruption, and increased risk to those living in Wales by reason of the divergence in NPIs. Given the need for consistent, clear communication with the public, there should have been good reason for any areas of divergence in policy between the four nations. The Inquiry must examine whether divergences were based on sound reason or whether, for example, they were politically motivated or otherwise misguided. The Inquiry must examine, bearing in mind the risk of confusion, whether the Welsh Government did all it could to seek to prevent repeated and avoidable ambiguity in the UK Government's public messaging and to ensure that its own messaging was crystal clear.

Turning to my final topic, my Lady, intergovernmental relations. The way in which the UK and devolved administrations interacted with each other in a time of prolonged crisis is a vitally important area of examination. We know from Module 2 that there wasn't a formal structure for regular meetings between First Ministers of the devolved administrations and the Prime Minister of the UK Government, especially after May 2020, when COBR ceased to meet regularly. Despite this, the evidence in Module 2 suggests that there were plenty of opportunities for regular contact between Welsh Government and UK Government at many levels. Is that correct? If not, if the Welsh Government had concerns about the level of engagement, what did it do about it?

The wider question is whether the Welsh Government genuinely sought to forge relations that would enable the best chance of alignment of policy where necessary, or whether there was a tendency towards silos and anti-Tory default position of one-upping and blaming the UK Government. There should have been no place for playing party politics in a pandemic, with lives at stake, and the Cymru group wishes to understand the extent to which party politics and public perception impacted on the Welsh Government's willingness to engage with and approach the UK Government in a spirit of collaboration.

My Lady, my conclusion will be delivered in Welsh, followed by English, and I'm told that I must pause to allow anybody who wants to listen via the headset to plug in.

**Lady Hallett**: Unless the English is a translation of the Welsh.

**Ms Gowman**: It is.

**Lady Hallett**: Otherwise we can wait for the English.

**Ms Gowman**: Absolutely.

(Interpreted): My Lady, there has been some acknowledgement by some witnesses that some errors were made by the Welsh Government in response to the pandemic, however the Cymru group considers the general tenor of the Welsh Government's evidence to be a gloss minimisation or the heavy caveat of hindsight; unacceptable diversion from accountability. The Cymru group is concerned that the Welsh Government has failed to meaningfully reflect on its decision-making during the pandemic to identify learnings. This concern is somewhat supported by the Welsh Local Government Association's evidence, which suggests that lessons learned exercises completed by Welsh Government have been carried out without input from its key partners.

The reality is that disclosure shared with this Inquiry suggests that errors were made. These errors caused unnecessary pain and suffering to the deceased and their loved ones. We invite the live witnesses to be reflective, accountable and to give full and transparent answers to this Inquiry so that lessons can be learnt. And there will be lessons to be learnt, and the Inquiry must make findings to prompt change.

To cite another Welsh proverb, [Welsh spoken], "Adversity brings knowledge, and knowledge, wisdom". Changes must be made speedily in the light of any findings so that when the next pandemic strikes, as it inevitably will, the people of Wales will be better protected from harm and loss of life.

Diolch am wrando, thank you for listening, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Gowman. Very grateful.

Mr Straw, any Welsh passages from you?
