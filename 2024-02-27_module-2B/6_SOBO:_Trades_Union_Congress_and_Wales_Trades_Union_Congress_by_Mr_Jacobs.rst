6. Submissions on Behalf of the Trades Union Congress and Wales Trades Union Congress by Mr Jacobs
==================================================================================================

**Mr Jacobs**: Good afternoon, my Lady.

This is the opening statement of the Trades Union Congress, the TUC, and the Wales TUC. The Wales TUC is part of the TUC, but is autonomous in matters that are devolved to the Welsh Government.

The 48 unions affiliated to the TUC represent over 5 million working people across a range of sectors and across the four corners of the UK. The Wales TUC represents around 400,000 workers in Wales through its affiliated unions.

The TUC and Wales TUC aim to provide a voice for working people and to shine a light on the consequences of government decision-making upon the experiences of those at work.

In Modules 1 and 2, the Inquiry heard evidence from Kate Bell, assistant general secretary of the TUC. In this module, the Inquiry is to hear evidence from Shavanah Taj, general secretary of the Wales TUC.

This opening submission will highlight the loss and sacrifice of those in the workplace in Wales, and focus on the approach to decision-making within the Welsh Government.

From the union perspective, as with the Scottish TUC and the Scottish Government considered a few weeks ago in Module 2A, the process of decision-making in Wales was one which no doubt had its deficiencies but was nonetheless underpinned by a process of meaningful engagement and partnership, which was welcome and valuable.

As with our opening submissions in each of the substantive hearings thus far in this Inquiry, we begin by acknowledging the loss and sacrifice during the pandemic in the workplace. We pay tribute and express gratitude to those who conveyed their stories so powerfully in the impact film this morning. It was a difficult but important reminder of the horrors of the pandemic, and the human stories that unfolded across so many parts of our society.

Those in workplace across a number of sectors played their part in the pandemic response. Those in healthcare were well and truly on the frontline and endured the dangerous, shocking and exhausting experiences of caring for those who were acutely unwell. As John said in the impact film this morning, "Thank God for the nurses that were there. You should see what the nurses were going through".

The social care workforce also suffered. It is a workforce that is generally undervalued and underpaid, yet during the pandemic the burden was monumental. As described by many, there were appalling problems with PPE.

Kate Bell's supplementary statement in Module 2 gave an account of a member of GMB who worked in social care and described being given a plastic pinny that appeared to be the same that was used in the catering sector for sandwich making. The worker described how distressing it was trying to support those dying in the care home as the virus ripped through it, how it felt knowing that no doctor or nurse would enter the building to administer anything to ease the pain for a dying resident.

As a workforce, many in social care felt forgotten, with little press coverage even at the time regarding district and community nurses, reablement, home care and residential care. The worker said:

"Covid has left a lasting impression on care. So many staff have left, as they have been sickened by the way it was dealt with. Many staff have said that if Covid hits us hard again, they will walk out of work and never go back in. Who can blame them? I think Covid will always affect us in whatever we go on to do in life. I've had flashbacks from writing this, and a few tears remembering."

Of course, there were those in other sectors who faced increased occupational exposure to the virus. Data regarding mortality rates across sectors indicates that process plant and machine operative occupations had the highest rate of mortality from Covid. Caring, leisure and other service occupations had the largest number of deaths of all the major occupational groups.

The Inquiry has already heard evidence as to the intersection between occupational exposure and socioeconomic inequalities. It was often the poorest in society who had the least ability to comply with measures, the least opportunity to work from home, and were most exposed to the virus in health settings and in service jobs.

There is also an ethnicity dimension. Professors Nazroo and BÃ©cares have described that those in ethnic minorities were more likely to be employed in sectors that increased their risk of exposure to an infectious agent, such as in transport and delivery jobs, or working as healthcare assistants, hospital cleaners, social care workers, and in nursing and medical jobs.

It all points, my Lady, to one of the profound consequences of the pandemic: that those who were generally less well off, with greater disadvantage and vulnerability, paid the greater price. It was the price paid by people who kept parcels being delivered to our door, who transported key workers to work, who processed our food, who stacked our shelves, who cared for our sick and elderly, and many others.

My Lady, two further points of context are, first, the lack of resilience of public services going into the pandemic and, second, the lack of advance planning. These issues have been the subject of Module 1 and will be the subject of a report from this Inquiry. Though not the focus of this module, these issues nonetheless loom large.

Whatever the deficiencies and virtues of the processes for decision-making in Wales, very little can be done to eliminate a profound lack of preparedness and resilience. As in England, services in Wales have been hollowed out by austerity; the waiting lists for healthcare and the consequences of such terrible waiting lists, which were touched on in the impact film this morning, were worsened by the pandemic but were not caused by it. There is a simple and inalienable truth that healthcare and social care services that are creaking in peacetime will struggle to avoid collapse if a pandemic hits.

The report from Module 1 is eagerly awaited, but it appears that the pandemic planning in Wales was as poor as it was in England. The essence if it is simple: effective pandemic response requires a quick response, but a quick response will be frustrated if there has not been the necessary planning. Many of the real opportunities to reduce the devastating effect of a pandemic such as Covid-19 lie in better advance preparation and planning for a future pandemic.

My Lady, we turn to the issue of government consultation and partnership with the unions and the pandemic response in the workplace.

An important feature of the pandemic response in Wales was the culture of social partnership which was well embedded before the pandemic. Boris Johnson's unfortunate words in private meetings were that he could not have "the bollocks of consulting with unions". In contrast, the approach in Wales was a shared sense of purpose common to government, unions and other partners. As Shavanah Taj describes, it is about delivering change by finding shared goals and listening in order to negotiate the best possible outcomes. Mark Drakeford appropriately describes this aspect as one of the most striking characteristics of the Welsh response to the pandemic.

As the pandemic hit, the structures supportive of social partnership were in fact strengthened and increased. The Shadow Social Partnership Council -- chaired by the First Minister and comprising of union, employer and government representatives -- was extended early in the pandemic with third sector partners and the Older People's Commissioners and Children's Commissioners. It was a sensible attempt to expand the breadth of views in forming the far-reaching decisions that the government were called upon to make during the pandemic.

The Wales TUC participated in various general and sector or issue-specific fora for decision with the government, which we have described in more detail in our written opening. The result was that the Wales TUC generally felt able to advocate for the rights and safety of workers at the very top levels of decision-making, and felt that their input was taken into account.

Like all meaningful relationships, it had its frictions, and that can be seen in the evidence; but that, my Lady, is a symptom of consulting meaningfully and at pace. Placatory and empty consultation is easy. Meaningful partnership can come with challenges.

The Welsh Government's comparatively open approach to consultation and seeking agreement and common purpose is a story told by a number of stakeholders. The Children's Commissioner for Wales has described being proactively consulted, as has the Welsh Local Government Association, the disabled people's organisations and the John's Campaign, although there have rightly been observations about how the processes need to be improved.

In the arena of workplace safety, the approach to social partnership bore some advantages. In Wales, the 2-metre social distancing in the workplace was introduced at an early stage as a legal requirement rather than discretionary guidance, as in England. The Wales TUC, working with the Welsh Government, set up a whistleblowing hotline enabling workers to report incidents of breach. The Wales TUC and Welsh Government also collaborated to introduce a risk assessment tool designed for staff in the NHS, but also used more widely to accurately assess the risk posed to NHS and social care staff. That was intended to enhance staff safety and ameliorate some of the disproportionate impacts.

One area of intense frustration, however, was the lack of enforcement of workplace safety. As the TUC and Wales TUC has pointed to on numerous occasions, the Health and Safety Executive is severely underfunded. During the pandemic, unions in Wales found consistent evidence that a significant number of employers were failing to take sufficient precautions against the disease, and workers repeatedly reported not being consulted on workplace Covid risk assessments. Despite clear evidence of the lack of adherence to regulations, the Welsh Government was unable to improve the situation.

Another important issue was that of financial support for those required to self-isolate, particularly those on low incomes in higher risk workplaces with inadequate provision for sick pay. A study by Public Health Wales noted the most common challenges for self-isolation included financial difficulty and the problem was pronounced for those in precarious work who were more likely to report financial concerns, more likely to report mental health difficulties, and more likely to report having no access to food or medication during self-isolation.

The issue was raised repeatedly by the Wales TUC with the government, but the response was mixed, and ultimately no more effective than that of the UK Government.

In Wales, the same ineffective Test and Trace Support Payment Scheme was introduced, albeit even later than in England. It was not introduced until November 2020. The reasons for that should be explored, and it may have been influenced by the financial aspects of the devolution settlement for Wales.

There were some positives. The Welsh Government did increase the payment from the Â£500 in England to Â£750, and the Wales TUC also welcomed the introduction of a fund to support creative freelancers affected by Covid-19.

Separately, social partnership contributed to the attempts to address the inequalities of the pandemic. On 1 April 2020, the Welsh Government invited union evidence on equality impact. The Wales TUC response highlighted the disproportionate impact on a range of groups, including the particular impacts on BAME workers, pregnant women, parents and carers, disabled people, and migrant workers. The Wales TUC also launched a survey to enable BAME workers to share their experiences.

Next, my Lady, we touch briefly on the differences in culture between the Welsh Government and Westminster.

We agree with the observation made by some, including this afternoon by the Welsh bereaved families group, that the dysfunction in Westminster should not be taken as some sort of barometer or baseline for assessing government; that would be to set an unacceptably low standard for the governments of our four nations.

We do observe, however, that the Welsh Government appears to have avoided some of the dysfunction seen in Westminster. As described, it was more open to partnership with others, but it was also quicker to work within agreed frameworks for decision-making, and there appears generally to have been appropriately formal and reflective discussion within government.

Finally, we touch on the issue of collaboration between the Welsh and Westminster governments.

We urge a cautious approach to the narrative suggested by Mr Johnson and others that differences were being sought for difference's sake. The differences may have resulted from a different approach to the balancing of the imperatives of saving lives and of saving livelihoods.

As the pandemic progressed, the UK Government -- at least the Prime Minister and Chancellor -- appear to have seen decisions as a choice between saving lives and saving the economy. Some within UK Government saw that as a false dichotomy, and that appears to have been the view also of the Welsh Government.

As Mark Drakeford has said, for the Welsh Government there was never a tension between these two objectives. If lives could not be saved, then livelihoods would be badly undermined because staff would become unavailable and customers would cease to be customers. For some in the UK Government, the debate was between either saving lives or saving livelihoods, as if these were mutually exclusive objectives.

My Lady, the flaws of that approach have been considered in Module 2.

My Lady, we conclude with this observation: to some witnesses in Module 2, the deeply unattractive side of the internal dysfunction within the UK Government was "just Westminster" or an inevitable part of government.

As with Module 2A, the evidence in Module 2B demonstrates that a more mature, professional and open form of central government is achievable. It is submitted that the evidence in this module demonstrates the value of a form of government that is open to and meaningfully engages with the views of stakeholders, including trade unions, but also of course many others.

In that respect, it is welcome that the Welsh Government has confirmed this approach for the future by establishing the Social Partnership Council in law and placing a social partnership duty on devolved public bodies.

Unsurprisingly, there is room for improvement. Earlier this afternoon, John's Campaign highlighted areas where greater consultation was required, and we say that the approach of consultation and engagement is one which should be embraced but also strengthened in a future pandemic.

My Lady, that's our opening statement.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Jacobs.

Mr Allen.
