6. Submissions on Behalf of the Welsh Government by Mr Howells
==============================================================

**Mr Howells**: My Lady, Rwy’n croesawu’r cyfle i annerch yr ymchwiliad ar rhan Llywodraeth Cymru.

I welcome the opportunity to address the Inquiry on behalf of the Welsh Government. The Welsh Government would like to reaffirm the commitment that was made during the preliminary hearing for Module 1 that we will give you the fullest possible co-operation in investigating the response to the unprecedented challenges faced by the people of Wales, their communities, their businesses, and their public services, as a result of the pandemic.

The Welsh Government will wholeheartedly participate in this module, relating as it does to the core political and administrative decision-making of the Welsh Government in its response to the pandemic.

This Inquiry is the best means by which the interconnected decision-making between the UK Government and the devolved governments can be properly explored. In particular, this Inquiry can look at how distinct decisions were made by each of the four nations for their respective countries either on a four nations basis or separately.

We have been consistent in our determination that our actions and those of our public sector partners in Wales are fully and properly scrutinised as part of this Inquiry.

The people of Wales deserve no less, particularly those who have lost loved ones, but also everyone else whose lives were affected by this devastating pandemic.

We cannot emphasise enough our commitment to this module and to the Inquiry as a whole, because we are determined that people's questions should be answered fully and transparently and that we all learn lessons for the future.

It is only right that the public hearings for this module will be held in Wales. Ac edrychwn ymlaen at eich croesawu chi a'ch tîm pan fydd y gwrandawiadau ar gyfer Modiwl 2b yn dechrau; and we look forward to welcoming your Ladyship and your Ladyship's team when the hearings for Module 2B commence.

**Lady Hallett**: The sooner I get the simultaneous translation set up, Mr Howells, the better.

Thank you very much, indeed. I do appreciate the offers of support and co-operation, as I've said now many times. We really are going to need it. So thank you very much for what you said on behalf of the Welsh Government.

**Mr Howells**: My Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Right, I think that completes all the people who wish to speak.

Right. Mr Poole, any closing submissions?
