7. Response Statement by Lead Counsel to the Inquiry for Module 2B
==================================================================

**Mr Poole**: My Lady, I'm grateful.

There are obviously a number of issues to reflect upon, but may I start what I anticipate and hope to be a fairly brief response by just expressing my gratitude and the team's gratitude and your gratitude, my Lady, to all the core participants and their advocates for their helpful, succinct and thought provoking submissions. Diolch yn fawr.

My Lady, I have already dealt with some of the points raised by the core participants in my earlier address, which I don't propose to repeat. There are, however, three themes running through the submissions made by the core participants that we believe can be answered straightaway.

They relate to the scope of Module 2B, the scope of future modules, and the Rule 9 process and disclosure process.

As to the scope of Module 2B, as I submitted earlier, the Inquiry team will approach the suggestions that have been made by core participants with an open frame of mind. It is, however, simply not possible to examine every issue or call every witness, even if thematically within the scope of Module 2B.

Having said that, and in response to a specific point raised by Mr Lloyd Williams King's Counsel on behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru, as part of our investigation the Inquiry team will be looking at what have become known as superspreader events in Wales. One such example being given as the Wales and Scotland Six Nations men's rugby match, due to take place on 14 March 2020 but cancelled the day before.

As to the point raised by Mr Williams about differences in wording between the scope documents for Module 2B and the scope documents for Modules 2, 2A and 2C. In my submission, nothing turns on any linguistic differences between those provisional outline of scope documents.

The short point is the modules are different, they are different because they are looking at different decision-makers and different decision-making processes. However, given the core subject under investigation, they are nevertheless fundamentally aligned. And whilst there might be slight differences in detail or emphasis, nothing more significant should be read into the differences in wording than that.

If I may then turn to the second point, namely the scope of later modules.

I have already given an overview of the topics that will likely be covered in later modules, namely the later system and impact modules, and although the provisional scope order of those later modules has not been determined, I would like to deal with a specific concern that's been expressed by Mr Rhodri Williams King's Counsel on behalf of the Children's Commissioner for Wales, which is essentially to question whether the Inquiry will be sufficiently focused on children and young people.

I would like to reassure the Children's Commissioner that the impact of Covid-19 on education, children and young people will be specifically examined in a later module. That is to say, whilst this module, Module 2B, will be looking at the extent to which the Welsh Government had regard to the particular interests of children and young persons, the focus of this module will be on the decision-making itself. The issues that flow from that decision-making, for example the detailed consideration of the impact of school closures in Wales on children and young persons, are not intended to fall within this module, Module 2B, and, as I say, will be addressed in a later module.

Similarly, Ms Jones raised a concern on behalf of John's Campaign and the Relatives & Residents Association, that the Inquiry should consider within this module whether the needs of people who require support from family or friends due to vulnerabilities such as dementia were properly taken into account in decision-making around the pandemic response.

Again, I would like to reassure Ms Jones and those she represents that the impact of the pandemic on vulnerable groups, including the elderly and those living with dementia, will be examined in a later module.

In Module 2B we simply cannot look at the specific impact of the pandemic on every sectoral group in the context of examining whether the Welsh Government failed to look at those issues. If the Welsh Government failed to look at a particular impact, or a particular area, or the likely consequences on a particular group within society, then that omission and failure will be absolutely apparent.

If I can then turn finally to Rule 9 requests and disclosure.

I have already addressed why we submit that the Rule 9 requests themselves ought not to be disclosed. I would, however, like to reassure the core participants that they will have full and proper opportunity to engage in the Rule 9 and disclosure processes.

As I submitted earlier and as, my Lady, you stated in your ruling in Module 1, the core participants will be provided with a monthly update of where the Inquiry team has got to in terms of the Rule 9 process and the disclosure process, and, my Lady, you might think that those monthly updates go a long way to meeting the concerns that have been expressed by the core participants this afternoon.

Those monthly updates will reflect a lot more about the way in which the Inquiry team has been asking for documents, the topics that we are interested in, the volume of material received, and what we expect to receive in future.

And of course, as the documents themselves are provided, the core participants will be able to see which of the issues in the provisional outline of scope those documents concern.

My Lady, that's all I say by way of response.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Poole.

That concludes this afternoon's preliminary hearing. I would like to thank everyone who has attended and those who have watched online. And particularly I would like to thank those who have contributed. We have again

said before, this is an extraordinarily complex Inquiry

with a huge range of various challenges, and I feel

increasingly optimistic that with the kind of support

and constructive suggestions that I have been receiving

over the last couple of days from core participants,

then we may be able to achieve the aims that I have set

out before.

So thank you, everybody, for all that you have said.

I will bear everything very much in mind and, I think

I said yesterday, I do have an open mind and the team

will be flexible, I can assure you of that.

Thank you very much indeed.

*(3.35 pm)*

*(The hearing adjourned until 10 am on Wednesday, 2 November 2022)*
