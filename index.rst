A Covid-19-is-airborne community view of the UK Covid-19 Inquiry
================================================================

.. note::

   The official UK government inquiry site can be found at
   `covid19.public-inquiry.uk <https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk>`_ and the searchable site on which THIS site is based can be
   found at `ukcovid19inquiry.dracos.co.uk <https://ukcovid19inquiry.dracos.co.uk>`_.
   We should pause to give `credit to Matthew Somerville <./Credit_To_Matthew_Somerville.html>`_ for that work.

The UK Covid-19 Inquiry was set up to “examine the UK’s response to and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and learn lessons for the future”,
chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a former Court of Appeal judge.  

The inquiry should (by may not) conclude that the UK should have identified primarily airborne transmission then tactically and strategically
mitigated for it. The inquiry may not conclude this, so we're getting that in writing while the inquiry is underway.

There were many questions not asked to witnesses as they testified.
Some pertain to the predominant transmission mechanism (:outline:`airborne` / :outline:`aerosols`). Like many, the UK government was at times talking up :outline:`droplets`
and fomites (and the ambiguous ":outline:`close contact`") mechanism of transmission (likely incorrect). With that a safe distance of two meters, and
hand-washing and wiping or surfaces. These mitigations were likely unhelpful in stopping transmission. One job of a Covid-19 public inquiry on those topics is to determine where those
claims came from. THIS site allows us to insert questions we would have asked of witnesses, were we there and had the legal right to pose questions.

Before the pandemic, it was easy for officials to discover which diseases were primarily transmitted via :outline:`airborne` routes (not :outline:`droplets` not fomites). See our `its-airborne.org/non-covid19-timeline <https://its-airborne.org/non-covid19-timeline>`_ and `its-airborne.org/non-covid19-list <https://its-airborne.org/non-covid19-list>`_. There are 129 entries here.

During the pandemic, it was easy for officials to discover that Covid-19 was primarily transmitted via :outline:`airborne` routes (not :outline:`droplets` not fomites). See our `its-airborne.org/covid19-timeline <https://its-airborne.org/covid19-timeline>`_ and `its-airborne.org/covid19-list <https://its-airborne.org/covid19-list>`_. There are 185 entries here.

.. note::

   For our entire site, we are yellow-highlighting :outline:`airborne` and :outline:`aerosol`. These are our indicators of correct 
   understanding of how Covid-19 transmits. We'd also highlighting :outline:`fomites` and :outline:`droplets` throughout 
   - the bad descriptions of how it transmits. Lastly, we are highlighting :outline:`close contact` for which a decent 
   description is still required because (say) *touching elbows* is **not** how Covid-19 transmits from one person to another. 
   Nor is standing one foot from each other, if both are in FFP3 (N100) respirators (or holding their breath).
