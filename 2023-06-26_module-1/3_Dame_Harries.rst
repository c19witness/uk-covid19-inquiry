*DAME JENNY HARRIES (affirmed).*

Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Ms Blackwell**: May I begin by thanking you for the assistance that you've so far given to the Inquiry. You have produced an extensive witness statement.

May we have it on the screen, please. It's INQ000148429. Can you confirm that that's your witness statement, please, Dame Jenny.

**Dame Harries**: It is.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. We can take that down.

We have also had two witness statements from Professor Isabel Oliver, who is the Interim Chief Scientific Officer. The first statement on 17 May 2023, which is at INQ000194054, and then a supplementary statement at 12 June 2023, at INQ000212902. May we have permission, please, to publish Dame Jenny's witness statement and the second of Professor Isabel Oliver's statements, please, today?

I can inform my Lady that the first witness statement of Professor Oliver will be published at a slightly later date.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you.

Please keep your voice up during questions, Dame Jenny. If I ask anything that you don't understand, please ask me to repeat it and I will.

I'm going to begin by taking you through your professional qualifications and previous roles and relevant experience so far as it is relevant to our Inquiry.

So you are now chief executive of the United Kingdom Health Security Agency, since its formation in April of 2021, and head of the NHS Test and Trace since May of 2021.

You, prior to joining the UKHSA, were the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England between 2019 and 2021, and prior to that you were the regional director of the south of England at Public Health England from 2013 to 2019, and prior to that you were the Interim Deputy National Medical Director between 2016 and 2017.

You have also worked as a director of public health. You are a medical physician with specialist training in public health medicine. You have formal qualifications in medicine and pharmacology, a Master's degree in public health and also one in business administration. You have a postgraduate diploma in health economics evaluation and a postgraduate certificate in strategic planning and commissioning.

You are a fellow of the Chartered Management Institute, a visiting professor of public health at the University of Chester, and honorary fellow of both the Faculty of Occupational Medicine and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.

You are a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, national advisory committee on the NHS Constitution, NHS England Clinical Priorities Advisory Group and Women's Health Taskforce.

In particular you were the national programme director for Ebola screening and the UK returning workers programme in 2014 to 2016, and you were the SRO of the subsequent development of the High Consequence Infectious Disease Programme, and prior to the Covid-19 pandemic you contributed to various significant health protection incidents, including Zika in 2016, the Hurricane Irma response in 2017, the Novichok poisonings in 2018 and the first cases of monkeypox in the United Kingdom in 2018.

During the Covid pandemic, you chaired the SAGE Social Care Working Group, led clinical work on the initial shielding programme, and acted for SRO for co-ordination of the subsequent Enhanced Protection Programme for those who remain more clinically vulnerable to serious outcomes from Covid-19:

**Dame Harries**: Broadly, yes. Can I just clarify a couple of points?

So the roles where you said I -- it started with membership of the JCVI, those are previous roles, they're not current, and that's important, I think.

The most important qualification, which you probably didn't read out, was a fellowship of the Faculty of Public Health. That's probably the most important one for now.

Then I would also just like to flag, just for clarity, I am a Welsh resident, and I realise there might be conversations around UK countries, and I trained in Wales, and to flag actually that I've spent more of my time professionally working in local -- as you've said, as a director of public health in the regions than I have nationally. So where that is relevant I'm assuming it will be okay for me to add that commentary.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Let's deal first, please, with the background and history of public health bodies in England, starting with the Health Protection Agency, which was established in April of 2003. To help put things in historical context, is it right that the HPA was the public health body in operation in England during the SARS outbreak in late 2002, but that outbreak, of course, was not contained until July of 2003, the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and 2010, and the MERS outbreak in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in June of 2012?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The HPA was an executive non-departmental arm's length public body sponsored by the Department of Health which was accountable to the Secretary of State for Health and the Minister of State for Public Health, but which was operated separately to the Department of Health?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Could we display, please, INQ000187830, which is in fact a sheet which helpfully description the different organisational models of national statutory bodies.

At page 1, paragraph 2, we see described an "Executive non-departmental public body":

"[Those] bodies are normally established [by] primary legislation. They carry out a wide range of administrative, commercial, executive and regulatory or technical functions which are considered to be better delivered at arm's length from ministers."

Existing examples given there are the Care Quality Commission and the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts.

We'll just leave that on screen for the moment, please.

You set out in your witness statement the five main roles of the HPA, which were: advising government on public health protection policies and programmes; delivering services and supporting the NHS and other agencies to protect people from infectious diseases, poisons, chemicals, radiological hazards; providing an impartial and authoritative source of information and advice for professionals and the public; responding to new threats of public health; and providing a rapid response to health protection emergencies, including the deliberate release of biological, chemical, poison or radioactive substances.

So can we see, Dame Jenny, that the HPA's principal role was related to health protection?

**Dame Harries**: (Witness nods)

**Counsel Inquiry**: There are three core strands of public health, are there not: health protection, health improvement and healthcare, public health?

The change that took place when HPA was replaced by Public Health England in 2013 to 2021 was brought about in part to make a cohesive change to the three core strands in public health; is that right?

**Dame Harries**: It is. My understanding -- I wasn't actually in the Health Protection Agency myself.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: My understanding was, along with a number of other public bodies at the time, that the intention was to try and, as you say, streamline this, I think partly or if not mainly for efficiency reasons. But actually in the -- for Public Health England there was a wider remit as well, which I think as you have been speaking through the Inquiry were very aware around inequalities and the importance of people's lives, their work, how they live on a daily basis and how important that is for health protection. So actually bringing together the health improvement elements alongside the health protection gave a potential opportunity to protect on all of those fronts in one organisation.

**Counsel Inquiry**: To help put things again in a historical context, Public Health England was in operation during the global outbreak of Ebola from 2013 to 2016, the MERS outbreak in South Korea in 2015, and of course the start of the Covid pandemic in January 2020.

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Public Health England was established as an executive agency of the Department of Health. So returning to our fact sheet, and if we look, please, at paragraph 4 of page 1, we can see that an executive agency is:

"A national body created administratively, not legally distinct from its 'home' Department. Examples including the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)."

And of course Public Health England.

So it was operationally independent but legally part of the Department of Health, the Department of Health and Social Care?

**Dame Harries**: It was, but actually in looking at your -- at that statement, of course I think the description of the non-departmental public body uses regulatory as a distinctive element, and in fact we say -- we can see here that MHRA is a regulatory agency. So I think what that probably signals is that, in theory, there is a lot of difference and in practice there potentially isn't.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, one of the differences between the way in which the HPA was created and run and Public Health England is created and run is that there was a direct link, wasn't there, there was a direct legal link between Public Health England and its home department, the Department of Health?

**Dame Harries**: Yes, that's correct, but the HPA also eventually will have reported back up to Parliament, I think, for its use of public money. So, as I say, I think the distinctions are there. They're clearly not entirely distinguished, even in this statement, and in practice I think they are less differential than perhaps is assumed from this.

**Counsel Inquiry**: As far as PHE's functions were concerned, they were wide-ranging and, as you have already told us, one intention was to bring together the three strands of public health. Its key functions, set out in your statement at paragraph 80, include:

"... fulfilling the Secretary of State's duty to protect the public's health from infectious diseases and other public health hazards.

"b. Improving the public's health and wellbeing.

"c. Improving population health through sustainable health and care services.

"d. Building the capability and capacity of the public health system.

"e. Developing and publishing the evidence base for public health ..."

Is that right?

**Dame Harries**: It is. I think probably in all of those it says somewhere "in partnership", because clearly one organisation can't do all of that, and that was a key component of PHE's work.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right. Well, in relation to pandemic preparedness and resilience, is it correct that PHE's functions included but were not limited to surveillance, the rapid assessment of the first cases and early alerting, testing and contact tracing, providing guidance on border and infection control, the exchange of information with international contacts, designing and running simulation exercises, and managing the pandemic flu stockpile?

**Dame Harries**: Yes. I think just -- on two of those points, which I'm sure we'll come on to, on testing and contact tracing I think it's -- we should not assume that is mass testing and mass contact tracing, which I think we will come on to.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: And in managing the stockpile, it is very definitely management and procurement rather than decision on.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right, thank you. We will be turning to look at that later on in your evidence.

Then bringing public health agencies up to date, we now know that the Public Health England organisation was replaced by the UK Health Security Agency, that change took place in 2021, and it became operational towards the end of that year, October 2021.

It's right, isn't it, that during the Covid-19 pandemic the government decided to separate out again the national health improvement, healthcare public health and health protection functions?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, so the health improvement functions of Public Health England moved into a new structure called the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, or the OHID, which sits within the DHSC?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The healthcare public health functions of Public Health England transferred to the OHID, NHS England, NHS Improvement and NHS Digital, and the health protection capabilities of Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace were combined into the new UKHSA, a pandemic preparedness and response super-body which has a permanent standing capacity to prepare for, prevent and respond to infectious diseases and other threats to health?

**Dame Harries**: That's right.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

So the UKHSA is an executive agency of the DHSC --

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- is that right? Thank you. We can take that down, please, now.

I want to look in a little bit more detail, please, at the changes made to England's public health structures by the Health and Social Care Act of 2012.

Would you agree that in 2012 there was a complex restructuring of health and public health services in England, including the -- abolishing the HPA and transferring its functions to the PHE, which involved the merging of 5,000 staff from over 120 different organisations. I mean, that in itself is quite a task.

**Dame Harries**: Yes. I mean, I think there's a series of different organisational moves which have involved very large numbers of staff and very complex systems working, including the last one.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. Also the abolition of strategic health authorities and primary care trusts, which were replaced with a number of clinical commissioning groups.

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The creation of a new arm's length commissioning body, NHS England, which came into force?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Also the Secretary of State for Health was given a statutory duty to take steps to protect the health of the people of England, meaning that at a national level accountability for health protection would rest with central government?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And importantly, giving local authorities responsibility for improving the health of their local populations, which was previously, I think, the responsibility of the primary care trusts?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The government's rationale for that change was that many of the wider determinants of health, for example housing, economic development, transport, could be more easily impacted by local authorities who had overall responsibility for improving the local area for their populations and who were well placed to take a very broad view of what services would impact positively on the health of their local populations and maximise benefits?

**Dame Harries**: Yes, I mean, it returned to the sort of 1970s model, a medical officer for health for the community, which I think was important, and if you look at where the evidence is now, after a little bit of a sticky start, I think that's where most people think a director of public health should be: in the local authority.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, the directors of public health in England were also given a new ringfenced budget and a duty to publish annual reports, I think, that could chart local progress. They were intended to be strategic leaders for public health, and health inequalities, in local communities, working with the local NHS across the public, private and voluntary sectors, and new proposed local statutory health and well-being boards.

In your view, Dame Jenny, that has been a successful implementation?

**Dame Harries**: It was a painful birth, I think, and I say that having taken my own team, when I was a director of public health in Norfolk & Waveney, over to the local authority and worked as chief officer in local authority and PCT. It wasn't welcomed by all and there were some losses, which we might come on to. But I think broadly now, and particularly actually since the last three years, it's been very clear that many of those public health director colleagues have really risen to the challenge and are very respected senior leaders in their communities.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Would you agree that the 2012 reforms across the board relating to mainly the creation of Public Health England but the other matters that we've touched upon received mixed reviews from the public health community?

**Dame Harries**: I think that's a fair comment.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Okay. The Inquiry has heard from Professor David Heymann, who was a non-executive chair of both the HPA and PHE, and also from Professor Whitworth, the biosecurity expert, who were both of the view that it was beneficial to have health protection and health improvement under one roof, the one roof of one organisation, because of the cross-learning to be had between those areas, and the synergy, as they described it, that was created between them as a result. But on the other hand, others have raised concerns about the structural reforms and problems that have arisen, which we're going to look at now, if we may.

**Dame Harries**: If I might just add, though, I think whichever way you divide public health it goes in multiple different directions, so there is no straight line which works perfectly, and what perhaps you haven't mentioned is the potential advantage of the organisation we have now, which is actually to build up on the science side, which I think has been a little bit suppressed in the last year, so totally supportive of the directors of public health but actually, when we get to what can we do to prevent a pandemic --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: -- it wasn't well placed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No. Well, we're going to look at the scientific side and how that has been perhaps improved by the UKHSA.

But remaining for a moment, please, with Public Health England, because that's the organisation that was in force in the run-up to the pandemic, and really throughout the majority of the timescale that Module 1 is looking at.

I want to look at five potential drawbacks: confusion over EPRR responsibilities, independence from government, funding issues, capacity issues, and fragmentation of public health services.

In his report to the Inquiry, Dr Claas Kirchelle has said:

"What sounded complicated on paper proved complicated in practice. The blurred statutory overlap between local authority, Secretary of State, and Civil Contingencies Act duties could create significant operational confusion over prime protection responsibility during emergencies ..."

Dame Jenny, do you agree that there was some confusion perhaps over roles in emergency preparedness, resilience and response arising out of what is described as a complicated overlapping or blurred state of statutory responsibilities?

**Dame Harries**: Yes, but I don't think it was a perfect system before either, and so I think what you're potentially getting is a central view out rather than an outside view in, but I do -- I agree in principle that it was confused, partly because of a number of different new changes, people have to get used to them, partly because of the movement, which, we've just said, I think, everybody supports, of the director of public health into the local authority.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Dr Claas Kirchelle also has told the Inquiry in his report:

"Although it absorbed many pre-existing structures, PHE also differed from its predecessors in key ways. In addition to its combination of health protection and promotion functions, PHE broke with the post-1950s English tradition of statutory non-departmental public health bodies that were set up by Parliament by being integrated as an executive body within the Department of Health. This not only resulted in far greater political control over PHE activities by ministers, but also meant that all employees were civil servants and subject to the Official Secrets Act -- a cause of concern amongst public health workers ..."

Do you agree with that as a description, and do you agree that the very close political connection between the organisation and government was a cause of concern amongst public health workers?

**Dame Harries**: I recognise the cause of concern and I recognise the perception, I don't necessarily agree with the content.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right. Why not?

**Dame Harries**: Well, I mean, I myself at times have been accused of going to the dark side. This is the standard thing. And it's very difficult because, as I pointed out when I did, I was a director of public health one day in a community and then, on the other side, the next, I'm just the same person with exactly the same professional skills and ambitions. There is a different way, necessarily, of working in government to try and achieve the outcomes, and I think the most important thing, as we'll probably see with other systems, is you need the trust of the people you're working with, and those relationships, and I think that is important to organisational change.

**Counsel Inquiry**: To what extent did being an executive agency of Public Health England affect its ability to act as an independent advocate for public health and decide its own public health priorities?

**Dame Harries**: So I think there are two answers to that. One is in reality and one is in perception, as I've said. So there was very definitely a strong perception. I can remember when I joined the organisation from -- you know, having not been in this area of work at all, was that government was trying to stop everything being published. So the minute you stopped to try to align comments so it didn't confuse the public, it was perceived as "government won't let us publish science", and it was entirely incorrect, and in fact there was a very specific clause inserted in the rule that said there is a right for Public Health England -- and we've retained it in the UK Health Security Agency -- to speak the truth about the science.

But there's also how you use that to enable good public health outcomes and sometimes it's better for the public, for the political context, you'll get better outcomes if you manage that type of relationship, and you almost have to be in it to understand it, and I think that's one of the problems.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So is it important in your view for public health advisers to be independent of the government, or at least appear to be independent of the government?

**Dame Harries**: So I like to think -- I am a civil servant -- this is where I have to throw whichever hat I'm wearing up in the air -- but I'm also bound by General Medical Council regulations, and I stick to them very firmly, but at the end of the day I'm bound by my moral compass, which is very definitely set on delivering public health outcomes.

So I -- there is a debate here about, if you are away from government, whether you can achieve good outcomes or whether it's better to be closer. But I think the key point is you need both, that's the really important thing, and you need the connections between them.

**Counsel Inquiry**: How important is it for an organisation such as Public Health England to be able to set its own strategic priorities, and is that possible with such a close connection with government?

**Dame Harries**: I think it is important, because I'm sure, you know, a lot of the conversations that have been happening so far in this Inquiry are very much about who is raising which issues, are they being heard, and that is part of that strategic direction, and in most cases they are the experts in the topic and need to do that. Nevertheless, the point you make is they will be to some extent moved by whatever the departmental initiatives and priorities are, and they are part of that machinery. So there is a balancing act.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Moving on to funding, please, could we display INQ000 -- ah, we have it already, paragraph 108. You're ahead of me, thank you very much.

This is, again, from Dr Kirchhelle's report and I just want to focus for a moment on the public health budget, please:

"Functioning of the new local and national English public health structures was compromised by austerity politics [in his view]. At the local level, the abolition of PCTs [primary care trusts] meant that overall public health performance was strongly dependent on local authority capabilities to commission and deliver effective services. Ministers had promised to ringfence the public health budget for local authorities. However, an in-year cut of £200 million in 2015 was followed by further reductions over the next 5 years. According to the Local Government Association, this amounted to a real term reduction of the public health grant from over £3.5 billion in 2015-16 to just over £3 billion in 2020-21."

That's a difference of 14%.

"Other estimates by the Institute for Public Policy Research spoke of an even more dramatic reduction of £850 million in net expenditure between 2014/2015 and 2019/2020 with the poorest areas in England experiencing disproportionately high cuts of almost 15 percent. Resulting pressures on local public health were exacerbated by an overall 49 percent real term cut in central government funding for local authorities between 2010/11 and 2016/17 and a resulting practice of 'top slicing' whereby authorities reallocated ringfenced public health budgets to other services broadly impacting health and well-being such as trading standards or parks and green spaces. In 2010, Healthy Lives, Healthy People had promised to give 'local government the freedom, responsibility and funding to innovate and develop their own ways of improving public health in their area'. Freedom and responsibility had been granted -- but funding was often lacking."

Thank you, we can take that down.

Dame Jenny, do you agree that the ringfenced public health budget reduced over time due to austerity?

**Dame Harries**: Yes. I mean, those figures -- and, I mean, I recognise some of them, obviously I've read the report, but I think they just need to be taken in context. If there are 152 top tier local authorities and a 200 million cut in a year, we just need to think that's just about a million, and we're -- so it's an important million for that local population --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: -- but just to put that in context and hold that tight.

Nevertheless I do agree with you and I know that directors of public health were under significant pressure. Local authorities were actually often much more efficient at commissioning services, so they could almost generate savings from that and get just the same public health outcomes, but nevertheless they were significantly under pressure.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But as well as having the opportunity to generate income themselves, the public health budget was reduced even further, wasn't it, by local authorities dipping into it due to cuts to their overall funding from central government, as set out in the piece that we've just seen?

**Dame Harries**: Yes, and rather than use the word "generate", I might just say that there was a lesser -- a lower loss, if you like, rather than -- it wasn't a generation --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes --

**Dame Harries**: -- it was just --

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- all right.

**Dame Harries**: -- (inaudible) more efficiently, just for clarity.

So I think the way the public health grant was managed, it went through Public Health England effectively, it came out as a top figure from local authorities. It wasn't possible, often, to see -- and we can -- I think may acknowledge that for health protection -- exactly the detail of what was being spent where.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: And it was a very sensitive area for obvious reasons. But I think it's fairly reasonable to assume that local authorities were translating where lives were being protected through the lens which they had at that time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do you agree that the poorest areas in England experienced disproportionately high cuts?

**Dame Harries**: I can't comment on that objectively without seeing the numbers, but my understanding is that that's the case.

**Counsel Inquiry**: How did the funding cuts impact on the work of the directors of public health and local authorities generally when it came to EPRR functions, do you think?

**Dame Harries**: So I think it's fair to say, I mean, even at the start, before any of the budgetary changes, whether because of perceptions of people, for example, in clinical roles not wanting to move to local authorities, or whether for other reasons, the changes, people -- actually lots of staff were lost in that move, so there was some skill loss, and then increasingly, as people went across, some of the -- initially, not now, but some of the directors of public health roles started to move down the hierarchy within the local authority and some of the more, if you like, the expensive roles, so some of the ones -- perhaps the clinical roles, would be lost. So I think it is fair to say, and I'm pretty confident it's evidenced, that some of the health protection skills were denuded from -- particularly from the smaller local authorities, where you would perhaps have one director of public health, one consultant and one other. Really quite small.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. In fact your colleague Professor Oliver tells us at paragraph 93 in her witness statement that:

"Over the period from 2009 to 2013, regional EPRR resourcing in terms of whole time equivalent capacity and relative seniority and that of other teams supporting EPRR functions reduced."

She says that consequently this impacted on the ability of regional teams to undertake EPRR functions including engaging in multi-agency pandemic preparedness work, and that reductions in funding also impacted on the HPT workforce which would have had a further impact on EPRR capacity.

**Dame Harries**: Yes, just for clarity, though, those comments relate to the Health Protection Agency EPRR capacity, not the local authority, which is what I was referring to before.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right. But do you agree --

**Dame Harries**: But I agree.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- with what she says in terms of the --

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- reduction in capacity.

Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: If you're moving on -- actually you have one more, haven't you, for the five?

**Ms Blackwell**: Yes, sorry, that was dealing with capacity issues and I'm just going to deal, if I may -- were you inviting me to take a break, my Lady?

**Lady Hallett**: When you're ready.

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you.

Fragmentation of the public health system. I'll just deal with this briefly if I may.

Professor Philip Banfield of the BMA has told the Inquiry that reforms of the public health system in England in particular led to a fragmented system, with the 2012 Health and Social Care Act fracturing in many places the links between public health specialists and NHS colleagues.

Is that something that you recognise, Dame Jenny?

**Dame Harries**: I recognise it as a recurrent theme every time there is a change in the system, and it happens always when there's an NHS change as well, so it's almost if you're working on the front line, you have to throw your rope out to the person you knew last week and see which organisation they've landed in. So I do recognise it but it's not that uncommon. I think it was particularly difficult over that period.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do you agree that community infection prevention and control suffered as a result of the fragmentation?

**Dame Harries**: So that was some of the clinical capacity that I was mentioning. It was a declining resource anyway, I think, so IPC nursing -- I know I personally persuaded two of my nurses to come across to the council with me. Most places were not that lucky, they mostly stayed in the NHS, and actually there was -- there is and was a strong need for them in the community.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Finally, do you have any comments on how the structural changes might have impacted on staff morale and working conditions, including pay, based on your own experience as regional director of the south of England PHE?

**Dame Harries**: So within the PHE at the time?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: So I think pay -- pay was a standard terms and conditions, so to speak, for different multidisciplinary, but that was not the issue, with one exception, I think, which was for EPRR staff, where the regional layer went, then people were -- then people were -- there was a reconstruction, if you like, and a formal consultation, and several people moved down a rank rather than stayed in their existing roles. So I think that did prove demoralising for many of them.

But I think the uncertainty around it, and, as I say, just trying to find out whether the other end of your rope needed to land is unsettling. People generally want to get on and do the job that they are trained to do.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And it created its own pressure?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you.

My Lady, is that a convenient point?

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much. I shall be back at 3.15.

*(3.00 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(3.15 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, Ms Blackwell.

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you, my Lady.

At paragraph 139 in your statement, Dame Jenny, you explain that the PHE centres and regional teams worked with the NHS and local authorities as well as with other agencies involved in local public health systems across all of the three domains of public health.

What did the health protection teams do? What were their functions?

**Dame Harries**: So the health protection teams were part of each PHE centre, and it's actually the same teams we use now. They would have a lead CCDC, a communicable disease consultant, who would work and link with the director of public health in a local authority. So if, for example, you had some sort of health protection incident, then usually the director public health -- one would alert the other, depending on how the situation had arisen, and they would work out between them how they needed to go about it. If there was a longstanding health protection issue, I can think -- smelly quarries or something like that, then they would call on resource from the centre of Public Health England to get specialist input.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You also say that regional directors played an important role in providing a local perspective in PHE's work at a national level. Can you provide an example of how that might have worked?

**Lady Hallett**: Before you do, could you speak more slowly? Like many of us, and I'm also guilty, you speak very quickly, and I know it's been a very long day for our wonderful stenographer, so ...

**Dame Harries**: My apologies.

**Lady Hallett**: Not at all, please don't apologise.

**Dame Harries**: I will try and speak more slowly.

So in response to your question, as a regional director for the south of England, I had two centre directors who would report to me, each of whom had several health protection teams, and if, for example, let's say it was a capacity issue, they were having problems with recruitment, we would be reporting that back in to the executive management team, nationally, to alert to the fact that there may be some risk in a health protection provision. Alternatively, if they were doing good work and had had some success in a particular issue, then that was an opportunity to be sharing that work.

But obviously it also gave an opportunity to feed back on the local political side as well and how different directors of public health were working in their patches.

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you.

There were a number of changes to the structures of the regions and therefore to the management and delivery of EPRR functions over the course of our module time period. What was the impact of those structural changes to the PHE regions and to the regional teams?

**Dame Harries**: So this started with the Health Protection Agency problems, and I think there were something like 28 strategic health authorities when it started off and gradually they all got removed and then we went into PHE regions.

The difficulties of coterminosity, or lack of it, was a major problem, and therefore, as numbers went down, with resource cuts across, obviously, local areas but Public Health England teams as well, then those individuals were trying to support more local resilience fora, directors of public health and local health resilience partnerships.

So generally it meant you were less able perhaps to put the same amount of input as you would have done, and support, into those different areas.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Professor Fenton, from the UK Faculty of Public Health, who we have already looked at, said:

"Health protection teams, which moved from the Health Protection Agency ... to [Public Health England] ... saw successive reductions in funding and capacity over the pre-pandemic years and a lack of investment in regional emergency preparedness, response and resilience ... teams."

He says:

"A direct result of these changes was a reduction in the amount of professional exposure that the public health specialist generalist workforce had to health protection duties and continuing professional development outside of PHE."

Now, first of all, could you help both my Lady and myself by explaining what a specialist generalist workforce might be?

**Dame Harries**: I will try very hard.

So the Faculty of Public Health and the Royal Society of Public Health, but the Faculty sets the standards for public health training. As people go through their training programme, they could become a health protection specialist, I mentioned a CCDC, a consultant in communicable disease control, who is very focused on health protection, or they could become a specialist generalist, meaning that they were general across all those three areas of public health.

But we would expect a generalist still to have basic health protection training and exposure, so that if you have something like a pandemic they also would turn to support that.

So I think what he's suggesting is that if the teams in health protection were getting smaller and perhaps a little bit more fraught and overworked, they would potentially have less time to support that training as the generalists came through.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Is that something that you recognise?

**Dame Harries**: It works both ways, because actually if you have less capacity in your health protection teams, it's great way to learn, because you get given a whole load of things because there's nobody else there to pick it up. But I think his point is he would be wanting to ensure those people were receiving on-the-job training, and there might be less capacity to do that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right, thank you.

I want to touch briefly upon the developments in the infrastructure of public laboratories and in the generation of microbiological data, because there will be other witnesses who will be helping the Inquiry with this, but we have received a report from the then CMO, Sir Liam Donaldson, called Getting Ahead of the Curve, which the Inquiry has read, and it was a report which proposed the creation, I think, of the HPA.

Within that report, there is reference to structural reforms that brought about the creation of the HPA in 2003. Is it right that during the creation of HPA that the public health laboratory service, PHLS, was disbanded and merged into the HPA, and that control over all the local PHLS laboratories was transferred into the NHS?

**Dame Harries**: I wasn't around at the time so I'm only able to give you the information as I understand it, but I think what happened is that there were 30 -- broadly the public health laboratory service grew up after the war and had quite a wide reach. At the 2002 reforms, when HPA was formed, around 32 laboratories went into the NHS, and the rest, if you like, the specialist laboratories and reference -- public health reference laboratories, went to Health Protection Agency, and those are the ones which we retain in the UK Health Security Agency and, previously, Public Health England.

**Counsel Inquiry**: How did that work in practice?

**Dame Harries**: Well, it meant that the local -- the NHS trusts, the hospitals, had their own laboratories attached, and so I presume what Liam Donaldson is referring to is there would -- he would perceive a fracture, if you like, between the NHS laboratories, now, and the specialist laboratories, and sometimes you need an alerting system to see where there are cases being diagnosed and then, if you like, send them on to the reference laboratories to check them out in detail.

I think in around 2010, again before I came into the English system, the -- there was a change in data flows, and therefore actually the reporting of data almost automatically then caught up, I suspect, with the concerns of 2002. So in general that work flows through.

We have different issues now, which is around staff retention and training and differential pay issues across the two divides, but I think the data flow issue is predominantly resolved.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right, thank you.

Does the microbiological testing of virus samples require laboratory facilities and laboratory scientists who are specially trained or is it something that all scientists working within the service can deal with, and can it be dealt with at any of the laboratory sites?

**Dame Harries**: No. So I think for many of the viruses that we will be talking about -- and they're very rare, you know, before I draw everybody's anxiety levels up. The Public Health England, at the time UKHSA now, deals with the very highest level pathogens. So we talk about containment level 4, the highest level laboratories, and those are only situated with -- on two sites for what was then Public Health England and another one, which was the government's scientific laboratory at Porton Down, and so none of the -- if we have a case of the high-consequence infectious disease case or pathogen X, whatever it might be, that we're uncertain about, they will be managed in a way which goes almost always to Porton Down or respiratory to Colindale labs, and they will be dealt with in those high containment facilities for safety.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What about the infrastructure of those two laboratory settings, in Porton Down and Colindale, and the requirement obviously to keep that infrastructure updated and safe?

**Dame Harries**: Yeah, so these are major undertakings. They're part, if you like, of the national -- well, they are part of the national security infrastructure, and therefore it's absolutely vital that the country retains them. In fact, as we've discussed, I think, through the early part of the Inquiry, we can see that the risks of these new emerging diseases developing and potential for needing to do more research and to use them for vaccine evaluation as well is growing.

Meanwhile, they take an awful long time to build, so it's very important that when decisions are being made about health protection, those sorts of decisions in funding and maintenance of laboratories absolutely factors in the timeframe for safe refurbishment and building.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Looking back now, do you have any reflections on whether all of the structural reforms had an impact on pandemic preparedness in England leading up to January 2020?

**Dame Harries**: It's very difficult to look back because the comments you've made about fractured lines and the potential -- there definitely was uncertainty after 2013 when Public Health England started. We know, in fact we've submitted a number of papers, where different parts of the system have tried to work, directors of public health, with Public Health England proactively to recognise different roles and responsibilities.

That said, we've also put forward in the evidence a survey which suggests actually that people do understand them. So my feeling is that the overall issue is more to do with capacity rather than roles and responsibilities.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You also deal with the funding situation of PHE in your witness statement and you tell us at paragraph 91 that:

"Over the lifetime of PHE, its funding from central Government was reduced by over 40% in real terms (ie taking into account inflation and unfunded pay pressures). Thus, the organisation had to implement the cost savings that this required so it met its duty to operate within its budget. In addition, there were budget reductions on the level of funding in PHE's predecessor bodies for the functions that came into PHE in 2013."

I'd like to display INQ000090350, which is an absolutely of yearly funding for PHE received from the DHSC that UKHSA has produced for the Inquiry.

We can see the year in the left-hand column, and the funding in levels of millions on the right-hand column.

So we can see that the core grant in aid funding that PHE received from the DHSC in 2019/20 -- thank you -- was 287.1 million.

If we move further up the chart and further back in time, in 2013/14 the amount was 392.5 million.

Is that the 40% reduction that you were referring to?

**Dame Harries**: It is, but it's in real terms, and I think we've explained in the submission, in the statement how that is derived.

But yes, effectively what was happening, not only was the grant in aid dropping, but the costs were going up, so maintenance of these very expensive laboratories which you have to retain. But also the organisation therefore, in order to sustain itself, became very dependent on its earnt income. It has absolutely brilliant scientists and it can generate some income. But by the end of this period my view would be that, rather than having a system that was a critical system for the UK, founded on a substantial grant that could maintain it, it was trying to pedal fast to keep up, generating income, and often using its scientists to do that rather than perhaps strengthen the wider health protection system.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just so we understand, although it appears that there is a big rise in funding in the years 2012/13 to 2013/14, that's because Public Health England was a much larger organisation than PHA, wasn't it, and it had to take on many more functions when it was created?

**Dame Harries**: It was, and also there's a change in the middle, and again I think explained in the statement, because it took on child -- some of the child public health programmes --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: -- which actually -- you know, the overall system went down but the -- there was an additional grant in aid for that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Apart from the way in which you've described in your answers just now, are there any other ways in which those funding cuts which ran in parallel to workforce issues and structural changes that we've just looked at impacted on PHE's pandemic preparedness functions?

**Dame Harries**: I mean, you know, I wouldn't like to make a particular case for this in the sense that I recognise at that time almost all public sector organisations were -- had budget decreases, but of course the combined effect of that meant that if the local authority also had insufficient and the NHS had also dropped their numbers of staff, what happened was, when you met round the local resilience forum table, you may not see the person you saw last week because they'd gone to another one. There weren't as many people there to staff.

So I think the overall impact was quite significant --

*(Alarm)*

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just pause, please, Dame Jenny, sorry. I'm afraid this is a recurring theme in the afternoon. And it's usually when I'm on my feet.

**Lady Hallett**: Don't get paranoid, Ms Blackwell.

**Ms Blackwell**: I'm sorry, I won't.

Sorry, Dame Jenny, you were explaining about perhaps not seeing the same face around the table?

**Dame Harries**: Well, concurrent efficiencies in relevant partner organisations is really important to meant a system-wide health protection response.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I'd like to turn now to discuss the interaction and involvement between PHE and the national risk assessment and how PHE works to create and provide the important facts and figures and calculations.

So could we have on the screen, please, INQ000206659, which is a document entitled "Risk assessment template cross-government risk assessment of 2018 emerging infectious diseases".

Is this the document that PHE would have produced and provided to DHSC in relation to the NRSA assessment for the risk pertaining to emerging infectious diseases?

**Dame Harries**: I'm unable personally to answer that directly. I would imagine so.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Because it's dated 2018, from your general knowledge of the system, could we assume that this was in preparation for the 2019 NSRA?

**Dame Harries**: I'm making that assumption.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right. Who would have produced this document, Dame Jenny?

**Dame Harries**: This is difficult, and I think it would be better to check. The general principle was that DHSC would feed into the national risk assessment, but they absolutely would consult with the specialists in Public Health England to ensure that the right information was fed back.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So does that suggest that the first stage of collating the information and performing the assessment happens at DHSC, and that that information is then provided to PHE for their comments and additions?

**Dame Harries**: Yes, I think with most of these processes you have a starting point and the first question is: is this still correct?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

**Dame Harries**: I mean, it's a practical issue, which, if you've got something on a piece of paper, people will comment no. If you put it open, they're less likely to. So I think you start off with: this is the position as it was last year or two years ago, does this still look right, are there new risks or should this change?

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'd like to look at the last two paragraphs on this page, please, and just remind ourselves of the reasonable worst-case scenario risk description, or indeed to see how it is in this template document.

Over the past 30 years, more than 30 new or newly recognised diseases have been identified. Most of these have been zoonoses, ie diseases that are naturally transmissible, directly or indirectly, from animals to humans. The reasonable worst-case scenario ... is an outbreak of a high-consequence infectious disease ... which is :outline:`airborne`. An :outline:`airborne` disease is more likely to spread rapidly from person to person, and can make contact tracing more difficult compared to other diseases which have a different route of transmission. Other emerging infectious diseases which are spread through different routes of transmission are explored in the three variations below.

"Specifically, the current RWCS is based on an outbreak of a respiratory infection in the United Kingdom ... which is similar to the outbreak of ... (MERS) seen in South Korea in the 2015. This has been chosen due to the current risk of this disease and the historical precedent of imported MERS cases leading to outbreaks. However, it should be noted that due to the nature of an emerging infectious disease there is some uncertainty as to whether a different emerging pathogen, including one which was :outline:`airborne`, would lead to an outbreak similar to the scenario described."

We can see, moving back to paragraph 4, that the "overall confidence assessment", the likelihood or plausibility, is assessed as being low.

Was the reference to infection control procedures a reference to IPC within the healthcare setting or community IPC or both?

**Dame Harries**: Sorry, where is the reference to IPC?

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we look at, in fact, over the page at page 2, I think it's clearer here. If we look at the first two paragraphs here:

"The RWCS is predicated on a novel or emerging infection (ie one that is either globally unknown or unknown/very rare in the UK) arising in another country and then arriving in the UK before it is identified. It is possible that a novel infection could arise in the UK first but this is less likely.

"Based upon the experience of recent international outbreaks of MERS, the likely impact of such an outbreak originating outside the UK would be cases occurring amongst returning travellers and their families and :outline:`close contact`s, with potential spread to health care workers, and other patients within a hospital setting. The resulting cluster of individuals with a similar illness should lead to infection control within health care settings and other public health measures being instigated which can control the spread of the disease. For MERS, sustained human-to-human transmission outside of :outline:`close contact`s and healthcare workers has been limited so far ... and therefore there is currently a low risk of this disease presenting a wider threat to the UK. However, sustained human-to-human transmission in emerging :outline:`airborne` diseases is possible, which is why infection control procedures are critical to the mitigation of this risk."

**Dame Harries**: Sorry, and could you repeat the actual question?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. So the reference in the middle of that paragraph, if we can highlight it:

"The resulting cluster of individuals with a similar illness should lead to infection control within health care settings and other public health measures being instigated which can control the spread of the disease."

So is the reference to infection control procedures a reference to IPC within healthcare settings or within community IPC or both, do you think?

**Dame Harries**: So, I mean, as I say, I'm slightly -- we just need to take this carefully because I'm not clear of the absolute origin of the document, but I can see a peer reviewed reference there, of 2017, so it's going to be 2017 or later, which -- and the reference to infection control will be, it says, within healthcare settings. But we always have infection control measures within healthcare settings. This will refer to, potentially, bolstered healthcare settings controls, and I think this work actually was taken forward in the HCID pathway work which resulted in the commissioning of five new :outline:`airborne` HCID transmission control centres, if you like, which were not in the UK prior to this.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right. When were those created or where were they created?

**Dame Harries**: So the names are actually in the statement, but the HCID work which started after Ebola, which is obviously a contact transmission, but looked at the potential for high-consequence :outline:`airborne` and touch transmission, and at the time there were just two contact transmission centres, which was the Royal Free and Newcastle, so, working with DHSC and with NHSE, new :outline:`airborne` transmission control centres, if you like, were created, so this is a direct result of the HCID pathway. And in fact in 2018, of course, we had a MERS case; appropriate IPC in healthcare settings was put in place, and there was no transmission.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right, thank you.

Is it right that, certainly looking at this document, which appears to have been based on the MERS outbreak, that SARS and MERS were considered to be primarily transmitted via :outline:`droplets` rather than :outline:`aerosols`?

**Dame Harries**: No, I mean, I think Professor David Heymann put it --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Sliding --

**Dame Harries**: -- I thought expressed it very well in his -- the evidence prior to this was that mostly people were infectious when they were symptomatic, and the :outline:`aerosol` generating procedures, so these are procedures where you are, if you like, it's not quite right, but actively pushing air up from the bottom of the lungs, which is different, for example, to having a virus sitting in your nose and it just popping out if you sneeze or are passing somebody.

So these were -- that is how the transmission had occurred, and if we go to the Korea case, for example, as soon as they had put in good infection control measures in the healthcare setting, then they got on top of the transmission.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right. And you've referred to the evidence that Professor Heymann gave to the Inquiry. He described, didn't he, that really the difference between :outline:`droplets` and :outline:`aerosols` is best described by a sliding scale --

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- :outline:`droplets` being the heavier, larger particles and :outline:`aerosols` being smaller, so the bottom of the scale.

**Dame Harries**: But there is also a generational thing, it depends about how forcefully they come out, which is why we have these distinctions about singing or shouting.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

If we can go to paragraph 15, please, at page 9 of this document. Now, we can see that according to this risk assessment, it states that the total number of estimated fatalities -- there we are, at the top of the page -- is between 40 and 70.

If we go to the last paragraph on page 10, please, thank you, and highlight the bottom paragraph, we can see that:

"The number of casualties is based on the MERS outbreak in South Korea."

Which we have already established. And:

"Given this number of casualties, the number of fatalities could range from 40 to 70. Approximately 40 people died in the MERS outbreak, but with a case fatality rate of 34.9% it is possible that up to 70 people could have died. Both figures could be higher or lower than this, depending on how communicable the disease is, as well as how quickly the disease is recognised and prevented from spreading further using infection control measures."

Let's just look for a moment, please, also at paragraph 16, which is on the previous page. We can see that the number of physical casualties is assessed here as being 200.

Do you know, Dame Jenny, why that figure was assessed at that level, taking into account that the number of cases in Korea was 186?

**Dame Harries**: Well, I don't, and I think I would need to look at this. I'm very happy to do that outside the court and provide written feedback. It's quite difficult to just look at the numbers and make that decision.

But clearly, you know, Korea is one setting. I think all of these suggestions or scenarios around reasonable worst-case scenarios are based on what we know and the context at the time, and that's as good as we have. So we know case fatality rate around 35%, and the rest of it is a very sensible but, in many ways, a slightly educated guess unless you've got other parameters.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. Can we take that down, please, and replace it with INQ000185135, which is part of the 2019 National Security Risk Assessment, which this information fed into. Could we go straight to page 8, please. Thank you.

Now, if we look at -- without highlighting, if we look at the two main paragraphs under "Human welfare", going further down to "Casualties", first of all, the total number of casualties here, in the document itself, is 2,000, and if we move up the page, the total number of fatalities is 200.

Now, again, I appreciate, Dame Jenny, that you weren't personally involved in creating this risk assessment, nor indeed in providing the figures that we've just looked at that appear on the template, but in your experience of these matters are you able to assist as to why, having been provided with the figures of between 40 and 70 fatalities and 200 casualties, those figures could have been expanded to 200 fatalities and 2,000 casualties, as we see in the actual document?

**Dame Harries**: So as I've said before, I mean, I would need to look at the whole document. On this sheet that you're showing me it doesn't actually mention which disease we're looking at, so case fatality rate for MERS was around 35% but I think for SARS in the early days it was around 10%, so that would immediately answer your question, but I don't have the rest of the information to do that. I'm very happy to take it away and look in more detail.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I think that would be helpful to the Inquiry.

On that point, let's just look at page 9, please, and the section entitled "Human welfare -- confidence assessment". Can we highlight that paragraph, please, because what it makes clear is that:

"For the number of casualties and fatalities, the lower bound is based on the MERS outbreak in South Korea. However, there's the potential for this to be much higher. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, there were approximately 350 reported deaths in China although this was where the outbreak [was] originating. Both figures could be higher or lower than this depending on how communicable the disease is [which is a phrase that we've also seen in the template], as well as how quickly the disease is recognised and prevented from spreading further using infection control measures. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of the outbreak on British Nationals Overseas. This scenario has not been modelled by the FCO or Department of Health. The number of non-British fatalities and casualties abroad will depend on the country where the outbreak occurs and the response of the responding health system. For MERS there have been 2,102 casualties; 733 deaths from 2012-2017 but for SARS there were 8,096 casualties and 774 deaths from November 2002-July 2003. The figures presented are therefore based on the SARS outbreak in 2003."

**Dame Harries**: Which aligns with what I've just suggested.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. So the figures are provided by PHE, and then they're not simply taken at face value, they will be worked on or adapted or perhaps even given a slightly different scenario in the preparation of this final document; is that right?

**Dame Harries**: I don't think I would translate it that way.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

**Dame Harries**: In the sense that the information -- I don't disagree with anything which is on the screen in front of me now, it's just we're talking about estimates.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: We have no cases to go on. So it's extremely difficult. All it's looking at is the totality of cases and other outbreaks and the case fatality rates. And even that, actually, could be over or underestimated depending on how many people were tested at the time.

So, I mean -- if I may, my Lady, there is a general point here about the way we're trying to fit viruses backwards, I suspect, either into legal arguments or the pockets of differentials in the risk assessment when they don't fit neatly in each. It's not possible often, in civil service terms, to actually say "unknown" in a box because it needs a number in a box in order to generate the next bit of the logic and the money that goes with it, and I think it drives some of these conversations into differentials which are not realistic. We just don't know, this is as good as we get.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right. There is a high level of uncertainty within that paragraph, isn't there?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Lots of variables?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And I suppose to a certain extent, you know, the figures are the best that can be achieved at the present time that the document is created?

**Dame Harries**: But I wouldn't like to suggest -- or at least I have no evidence to suggest that somebody has taken some figures in one place and then moved them around in the others. What is stated here looks reasonable.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

**Dame Harries**: It's just very uncertain.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you, we can take that down.

The provision of expert scientific advice and contribution to expert advisory groups. We know that PHE contributed to a number of the scientific committees that advised central government and often provided a secretariat for them.

As far as you're aware, to what extent were experts provided by PHE able to challenge the views of experts on those panels?

**Dame Harries**: So usually if colleagues in PHE were attending any of those groups they were there as individual experts. It depends what group it was. And in fact for UKHSA we've just done a review and we've identified 19 different government -- I mean, just to make the spaghetti even worse -- different advisory committees. And then there are a whole load beyond that which are not government ones, are technical advisory groups.

So if they're on a government -- there is a government advisory committee, there are rules about how you -- and I think you've had those as well. They will be there offering their independent professional advice and they will be receiving that from other colleagues around the room.

If you looked now, for example, we run technical advisory groups and UKHSA will chair them, and so they would be there as a UKHSA representative. But actually there are a number of places where people will get external advice, including, for example, from the advisory boards both of PHE and UKHSA.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You will be aware, I think, Dame Jenny, that the Inquiry has heard about the need to avoid groupthink, particularly in these advisory groups. Do you have any reflections on whether or not the PHE scientific experts may have contributed to groupthink or suffered from that as a principle?

**Dame Harries**: I'm smiling because there are a number of words which keep repeating through the Inquiry. I don't hold with the groupthink agenda, I think people spoke very freely, they may not all have thought the same thing, and at the end of a meeting you have to come to a consensus statement and position to support progressing whatever the topic in charge is. But on the whole, scientists are quite outspoken. And I think it was Sir Patrick Vallance who said they actually quite like to be challenged and have to change their mind. It's quite exciting if you're a scientist. So I don't really hold with that.

I do recognise that particularly during the pandemic, and actually through lots of incidents, there is a feeling of people being left out of the room. Everybody wants to be in the room offering views, and there has to be a practical limit to that. It should be representative, it should be challenging, you should have the right skills, but you can't have everybody or the whole response stops.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So perhaps the composition of the groups is important to --

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- make sure that there is a range of experience and viewpoints?

**Dame Harries**: Absolutely.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

Simulation exercises. We've received information about several exercises through the course of our preparation for the Inquiry. I want to concentrate, please, Dame Jenny, with you on Exercise Alice.

Could we have up on screen, please, the report, which is at INQ000090431. Thank you.

I think it's possible also to display at the same time a freedom of information request which was made by a member of the public in relation to actions implemented as a result of this exercise, which is at INQ000191910, if we could put that up on the right-hand side of the screen, please. Thank you.

This, as the Inquiry has already heard, was a tabletop exercise conducted on 16 February 2016 in London to explore the challenges that a large-scale outbreak of MERS CoV could present nationally to health partners in England, and participating in the exercise were representatives from NHS England, Public Health England and the Department of Health, as it then was, and also observers from the Cabinet Office, the devolved administrations and GO-Science.

If we look at page 5 of the report, please, we can see the objectives of the exercise at paragraph 2.2:

"1. To explore and confirm the health capabilities, capacities, protocols and resources, including surge arrangements.

"2. To explore and confirm national command, control, communication and co-ordination arrangements.

"3. To explore the capability for contact tracing and quarantining of possible MERS CoV cases.

"4. To explore and confirm co-ordination of public messaging associated with a large number of MERS CoV cases."

If we just remind ourselves of the scenario, it was where a group of people from London and Birmingham had travelled to the Middle East and ten days after they returned three of them presented at three different hospitals with flu like symptoms. After their histories had been analysed MERS CoV was suspected and a process of contact tracing was initiated, and after two days two of the cases were lab confirmed and a further case, at St Thomas' Hospital was strongly suspected. Prior to arriving at the hospitals, two of the patients had been part of a large gathering, and the scenario then developed with 50 lab confirmed cases and 650 possible contacts, and various elements of the NHS were under pressure from the cases and the media had taken a keen interest.

There was a general consensus on the need to identify capacity and capability of assets within the health system, and the level and use of PPE was central and considered of crucial importance for frontline staff. It was noted that the learning from Ebola on infection control understanding, although improved, was still not embedded with staff. And also considered important were access to sufficient levels of appropriate PPE and pandemic stockpiles to ensure sufficient quantities of PPE were available.

If we can look at some of the lessons and actions identified, and go to page 10, please, and look at action 4. Action 4 was to develop a MERS CoV serology assay procedure to include a plan for a process to scale-up capacity.

Now, is that relating to an antibody test?

**Dame Harries**: Well, it's a detection test, yes, a diagnostic test, and that was completed by PHE, and in fact they'd been working on them since 2011. It's why we had such good early access during the Covid pandemic.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

In relation to this action 4, if we look to the document on the right-hand side, please, which if we go to page 2, fortuitously is set out in the same order, and we highlight number 4, we can see that the answer to this question was that the procedure was developed and used during the management of the imported case in August of 2018 -- that's the imported case of MERS, isn't it? -- and that:

"Laboratory procedures for scaling up capacity have been well rehearsed across a range of outbreaks."

Can you explain what range of outbreaks that capacity would have been rehearsed in relation to?

**Dame Harries**: So if you have a new infection, it would be PHE's role to create the assay, the diagnostic test, and be able to scale that, and initially you would usually go out to Public Health England laboratories, then out to NHS laboratories, depending on the risk associated with the pathogen itself.

So, I mean, when -- once you have an assay for something, it's -- I mean, I'm not an expert in serology assays, that's why we have them. Once you have them, there's a -- you've usually got your skill there, although you do need to ensure that they are -- remain quality assured.

So in terms of rehearsed across a range of outbreaks, I'm trying to think what else would have happened in that intervening period.

So I can't offhand think what happened between 2015 and August 2018 save to say that obviously this is an example that it had been rolled out and was available.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right. All right, thank you.

Can we go to action 5, please, which is on the following page of the report, on the left-hand side. Thank you.

Now, this is an action to:

"Produce a briefing paper on the South Korea outbreak with details on the cases and response and [to] consider the direct application to the UK including port of entry screening."

In relation to this point, can we now go to the freedom of information request and have a look at whether or not this was an action that had been taken up by the time that this response was provided.

The response is that:

"... port of entry screening has been found to be of minimal use across a number of outbreaks and has been widely studied. The details of individual cases have not been released apart from the index case. The protocols developed following Exercise Alice were tested in the response to the importation of a case in 2018 which was successfully managed."

But in terms of whether or not the briefing paper was ever prepared on the South Korea outbreak with the intention of taking on board the manner in which South Korea reacted to their outbreak of MERS and attempting to learn for the United Kingdom, do you know, Dame Jenny, whether or not that briefing paper was ever prepared?

**Dame Harries**: So I think what I'm reading here is -- and I wasn't at Exercise Alice myself, but what I understand has happened is that the lessons that were learned from it, in terms of the importation of this case and the learning from South Korea, was moved into what I would call practical utilisation. So we may well come on to the National Incident and Emergency Response Plan, the NIERP, gets updated regularly, now on an annual basis, proactively reviewed, and learning from this will get fed into it. But I think importantly there will have been discussion, and I think it was in our pack that we sent in, around the clinical management of cases.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: That actually went into the doctors' packs, for example, for those people who were on call, it went out to the NHS, so there was a clear pathway for managing cases.

So depending on whether you -- I think there are two issues here: there's management of the case, and I think we have submitted some evidence that PHE did that. I think the port of entry screening evidence base, about whether it works, is a separate issue, and I'm happy to talk about that. Then, though, I think there are then port health, which is a completely different issue, and I'm very happy to talk about that as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I was particularly interested in the management of cases, but it's --

**Dame Harries**: So there was -- I think we've submitted a document, I think it was 2017, which went through the normal review process in the EPRR delivery group that was included in the pack. I think it was temporarily held up, not from the doctors' packs but in order to make sure that it aligned with the HCID pathway that was under development. And that's now out on the website for everybody to use.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So once that was affirmed, then the guidance was given, thank you.

Can we look at action 7, please, which is on the following page of the report. Page 13, thank you.

To:

"Produce an options plan using extant evidence and cost benefits for quarantine versus self-isolation for a range of contact types including symptomatic, asymptomatic and high risk groups."

Is it right that there was a lot of discussion around the issue of restriction of movement of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and whether this should be voluntary, that's self-isolation, or through enforced isolation, which is quarantine?

**Dame Harries**: Not just for this, but for Ebola as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

**Dame Harries**: And I was personally involved with some -- many of the Ebola discussions. So I would classify action identified 7 as a wicked issue and one that we might want to return to.

One of the problems with this is it's not something, I think, that PHE can resolve independently, and I think there is submitted with the statement a document from 2019, after quite a long piece of work, about port entry screening, and the two link together, because obviously if somebody's coming in you need to grab them when they come in if you're going to do this.

These are very, very difficult decisions for individuals to make. The law needs to support them, and there are costs involved. And the evidence base is often in a completely different direction to political will, and so they're very difficult issues to deal with.

So I think PHE, as far as I understand it, had done quite a lot of work on port health. This was one of the areas that they had identified that they needed support from the lead department. It requires buy-in from the Department for Transport, Border Force, almost everybody, and I think it hasn't progressed beyond that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: This issue in particular has a number of possible options, doesn't it? I think in South Korea there was the use of hotels, but then there is also the option of using specific locations as sites for quarantine, and also the legal rights of the restriction of movement of people, and all of that is brought to bear, isn't it, during this discussion? So it's not a simple matter by any means?

**Dame Harries**: It's not at all, although we -- you know, the country has used a managed quarantine service during Covid, but many of those difficult issues have surfaced through that utilisation.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

If we just look, please, over to the other document and see what response was given by PHE, it says:

"This background research has been used to develop the current guidance. Any decisions about making this enforceable were outside the remit of PHE."

Which is --

**Dame Harries**: Which is more or less what I'm saying, and it does link very closely with the port health discussion.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Actions 8 and 9 are to:

"Develop a plan for the process of community sampling in a MERS-CoV outbreak ..."

And also to:

"Develop a live tool or system to collect data from MERS-CoV contacts ..."

If we look over to the FOI document, dealing with 8 first, we can see:

"Develop a plan for the process of community sampling."

PHE confirm that "guidance has been produced and is available at", the following place, and:

"Sample processing will take place in the routine manner, adjusted for scale. As part of any incident response, this scale will be determined and then appropriately resourced in conjunction with other responding agencies."

And that:

"This is also contained in the first few hundred (FF100) Enhanced Case and Contact Protocol which is also available at the above link."

Then we see the answer to number 9, to develop a live tool or system, is that:

"... There are a range of systems that were employed by PHE and continue to be employed by UKHSA for gathering data from contacts across a range of outbreaks and are chosen based on the scale of the outbreak. They are causative organism agnostic to avoid duplication or processes."

Can you explain to us, please, what causative organism agnostic means?

**Dame Harries**: I was going to say, both of those are quite Mr Humphrey.

So basically what it's saying is there are ways of collecting data depending on the sides of the outbreak and the type that it is, and you do need to fit it to that. For example, in fact, if it was not this organism but a food-borne one, for example, we might be working and looking at local authority systems and environmental health officers.

So I think there are two issues in both of those examples. One is, my other wicked issue for the Inquiry would actually be community sampling. So UKHSA has actually put in a sort of mini rapid response team to enable that in some cases, but it is not mass testing. So I think this move from large-scale contact tracing or large-scale community testing to mass testing is one that is not resolved.

There are -- I think our data systems are much better, but actually it requires infrastructure as well, and we're still continuing to try and build the systems that we had, which were excellent towards the latter phases of the Covid pandemic, but still need both infrastructure support, if you like, and operational utilisation.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right, thank you.

We can put those documents off the screen now.

Do you agree, Dame Jenny, using what we've just looked at as examples, that Exercise Alice presented us with the opportunity of conducting important research which should feed into emergency plans not only for a future MERS CoV outbreak but also any other type of emerging infectious disease?

**Dame Harries**: Yeah, I think actually I looked at these with interest because I worked directly on the airport screening for Ebola, and a number of these discussions and problems arose, and then we had this. But at the time that Exercise Alice happened, we were developing proactively the HCID pathway --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Already?

**Dame Harries**: Yes. So I think to some extent, whereas you might think this would be a stop point to say, "Let's do something", in fact a lot of the activity was already happening. What we do now in UKHSA is if we have an outbreak we immediately put in a research programme at the start that says: what are the questions we're finding that we don't know the answer to? So that we try and kick that off immediately so it supports, you know, outbreak management later.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. It's fair to say, though, that looking at Exercise Alice and some of the actions or lessons learned that were highlighted, and from the evidence that you've given and what we've seen from the freedom of information request, that some of the actions were implemented by Public Health England even though that was not the commissioning organisation for the exercise. Why would that be? Would Public Health England have taken on actions that were ordinarily outwith their own work areas?

**Dame Harries**: They will always try and do the right thing, and that's often not recognised. So this is a great opportunity to do so. And I tell staff to run towards things if it's important for health protection. But those two issues around port health -- and I think we can see that in the work frame there -- were there from Ebola, and community sampling is a long-standing issue, so those are two issues which I think the organisation has felt unable to resolve on its own, and it needs wider than DHSC. That's also my point.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

There was an exercise that took place in 2016 called Exercise Northern Light. I don't want to go to the details with you, but just to say that one of the matters identified during the course of the exercise was that current arrangements with supporting surge centres and partner organisations would benefit from future development in preparation for multiple HCID cases; and I just raise that because I'd like to move on to Exercise Cygnus which took place in October of 2016.

Again I don't want to go to the documentation, but simply to confirm that one of the lessons identified in Operation Cygnus was that an effective response to pandemic influenza -- because that was the subject matter of this exercise -- requires the capability and capacity to surge resources into key areas which in some areas were lacking.

Then Exercise Broad Street in January of 2018, which had as its subject matter an HCID outbreak, also touched upon the need for surge capacity.

Do you accept, Dame Jenny, that by the time we reached the outbreak of Covid-19 in January of 2020, that there had been lessons identified, warnings given, however you want to describe it, that come a pandemic, whether it be influenza or another type of disease, there needed to be within the health systems of the United Kingdom public health and also general health the capacity for a surge in terms of within hospitals, within workforces, and within a capacity in order to try and deal with a significant outbreak?

**Dame Harries**: I do, but I think all of those three things are quite different surge mechanisms, and I'm wildly trying to remember -- it's a bit like variants for Covid -- which one the Northern Lights exercise was, I think it was Lassa fever and H7N9, which was to try and see if two HCIDs, an :outline:`airborne` and a touch, could be handled at the same time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: Which is -- as long as they're small case numbers, it's a different type of surge. Whereas pan flu is obviously a very large national one, and the Broad Street I think was checking --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: -- effectively the pathway that we were just putting in on the HCID pathway. So -- and they're checking different parts of the system. There's an NHS surge, there's a whole population public health surge.

So I do broadly agree, but I think two of those worked reasonably well. It's the Cygnus pan flu one where the capacity obviously was stretched, and there are mutual support arrangements. So each Public Health England centre would support the other one, it would divert calls or you could have whole regions working, and the emergency response plan outlines that work and allows resource to be flexed, and we can work across with NHSE as well. But I think the pan flu one is the one -- is more like the Covid that we've just experienced, and says "Actually when really stressed the resources are very, very low".

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

At paragraph 106 in your witness statement, you say this, that:

"PHE had identified a gap in national strategy across government focusing on infectious diseases since the 2002 Getting Ahead of the Curve document, thus in 2018 it started work on an infectious diseases strategy which was published in autumn 2019 through a joint launch with the Chief Medical Officer."

You go on to say:

"This identified ten strategic priorities including infectious disease surveillance, whole genome sequencing, major emergency response, and health inequalities."

For how long had that gap existed?

**Dame Harries**: So I don't think it was a gap in action, it's a gap in focus.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

**Dame Harries**: So the initial Liam Donaldson document from 2002, Getting Ahead of the Curve, was a CMO document setting out a strategic direction and actually forecasting almost the creation of the Health Protection Agency.

This one was actually very much more about -- it was actually an internal strategy. It wasn't so much a national one, but it had very wide consultation, and it was designed to put some focus and also recognise that there were new developing techniques. So the whole genome sequencing activity is moving us into a completely different realm of health protection with new opportunities in how we manage outbreaks and get on top of them more quickly.

So I wouldn't like it to be thought that the -- those streams of work were not ongoing and, in fact, you know, we're just about to publish our own UKHSA strategy for the next three years and the topics will be pretty familiar because that's what we need to focus on.

So I would not read an absence into that, I would just say it was far more of, after an internal reorganisation, getting a focus on the topics that were already being worked on.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So is it possible to say whether that gap in infectious disease strategy had any impact on the UK's preparedness for a pandemic?

**Dame Harries**: I don't -- I mean, apart from the general capacity issues and the financial background, I don't think it did, and in fact what you can see during that time is, for example, the way that we started diagnosing and treating TB -- which is done at the Birmingham PHE, now UKHSA, laboratory using whole genome sequencing -- actually progressed very rapidly and moved from around a month in detection to coming to a week, and knowing whether you had a multidrug-resistant TB case. So these were actually advances, not going backwards, so I don't think I would accept that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Before we leave this subject, I just want to ask you: to what extent did PHE seek learning from other countries that dealt first-hand with outbreaks including SARS and MERS?

**Dame Harries**: So that happens at a number of levels. It works -- it used to work, we continue to work with DHSC who have the prime relationship with WHO, for example, but actually the previous health protection and medical director Sir Paul Cosford was on whatever the board level was for European Centre for Disease ... Control and contributed to that regularly. There are individual groups across, we have experts supporting -- in fact in many ways leading -- WHO laboratory -- reference laboratories.

So there's a lot of different individual professional levels. And again, I know it's a recurrent theme, but I think people are unfamiliar with the level of interconnectivity on an international basis, both on an individual level and organisational.

I mean, I might say as well that PHE was part of IANPHI, which is the institute -- association of national public health -- International Association of National Public Health Institutes, yet another acronym, and would regularly exchange information, and that happened through Covid and continues to.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I'd like to ask you now about the Public Health England emergency planning documents, and two in particular, the ConOps document and also the NIERP, did you call it?

**Dame Harries**: I call it the NIERP, it's the national planning document.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, all right.

So the ConOps document, was this updated after 2013?

**Dame Harries**: It's updated regularly and annually and it had a very big update, I think it was after Ebola, it was around 2016/17.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right, okay, and this is the document that details PHE's response to incidents. Yes. And is it intended to be used alongside the NIERP and also deal with threat specific plans?

**Dame Harries**: So it's progressed. So it started life well before I was involved within it but, as I say, it's almost come together as a single plan, so an operating process in the background framework, and is, yes, is agnostic to the threat. But the people who might be involved in it will be decided by the nature of the threat.

So, for example, it would manage a business continuity issue. When all the steam valves go supporting one of the laboratories, it's more likely to be somebody on the corporate management side, a senior leader; whereas if it was a high-consequence infectious disease, the strategic response director would almost certainly be a medical professional.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right, thank you.

I would like to look at the pandemic influenza response plan 2014, please, and we can see this at INQ000178938. In fact, these are the minutes of a board meeting of the Pandemic Influenza Co-ordination Group of July 2019, and we can see that if we move down the page, please, and move to page 2 and look at the first paragraph, we can see that there has been prepared a paper on outline specific functions:

"... as this is a draft, the divisions listed in the document are in no particular order. GD thanked those who have already contributed; GD still waiting for a few more sections of PHE to contribute."

Then this:

"Noted that the challenge is that some PHE structures have changed significantly since the last PHE pandemic flu plan was published so we have to reorganise the document in that respect (eg NIS was formed since the last plan was published)."

All right, just pausing there, please, do you know, Dame Jenny, whether or not the pandemic influenza response plan was updated post-2014 in order to reflect the fact that there had been a change in PHE structures?

**Dame Harries**: I think it wasn't, because the plan was -- and I think you may have heard earlier -- that Department of Health were due to upgrade their plan and therefore the idea is that these cascade and follow and link with each other. That said, the national infection service was formed of recognised groupings within PHE, professional groupings. So I think it wouldn't be that the plan would be inoperable, and in actual fact the way that the NIERP -- if you'll excuse the acronyms -- works is that you have that as the backbone of emergency responses and then your plan runs alongside it. So the operational response would still have happened, but you are right, there wasn't a follow-up plan from this. We were -- I think PHE was waiting for the DHSC one to come through.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right, so no update between 2014 and the outbreak of the pandemic in January 2020?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Ms Blackwell**: I'm being told that our brave stenographer would like a break in about five minutes.

**Lady Hallett**: How much longer have we got to go?

**Ms Blackwell**: I've probably got about 15 minutes left, so ...

**Lady Hallett**: Right.

**Ms Blackwell**: Then I think there's about five minutes of questioning from another of the CPs, so --

**Lady Hallett**: Let's break now.

**Ms Blackwell**: -- it's convenient to do so. Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Five minutes.

*(4.26 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(4.31 pm)*

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you, my Lady.

So we'd established, Dame Jenny, that in relation to the pandemic influenza response plan of 2014 it was not subsequently updated between its implementation and the pandemic hitting to update in terms of a change in organisational structures.

Could we go to page 67 of the plan, please -- thank you -- the first paragraph, which states:

"During a pandemic NSC(THRC) will co-ordinate central government activities, make key strategic decisions such as the countermeasures required and determine UK priorities."

Do you agree, Dame Jenny, that that appears to be a misunderstanding of that body's role, that in fact the NSC(THRC) was a body that enabled ministers to spot major emerging diseases and understand the risks and receive expert advice on response and mitigation?

**Dame Harries**: I read it as a co-ordination role. I realise that's not exactly -- it does say "co-ordinate", it's not exactly what it says. How I read that and in fact what happens in practice --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: -- is that CCS will ensure that everybody is in the right place and obviously all the ministerial decisions finally get agreed at COBR --

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

**Dame Harries**: -- for something like this. So, you know, I cannot foresee that we would have a pandemic without some COBR decision-making.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No, but this sentence, as I've just read it out, and the description that it provides about the practical level at which this group would be involved in a pandemic is misleading, isn't it?

**Dame Harries**: I think it could be phrased better, let's put it that way.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

**Dame Harries**: I mean, it pre-dates -- well, no, it must have been started when I joined, around the time that I joined PHE, and I wouldn't necessarily have personally been responsible; and sometimes you do look back at documents and you think that was not entirely well articulated. So I think it could be better articulated.

I think people will have -- those people involved in the response will have known where the wheels were turning and in fact will have been invited, for something like this, to contribute either directly to COBR or through CMO.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But the benefit of a document like this being accurate -- not only in terms of its description of the health bodies but also of the role of a CCS, Cabinet Office body like this -- is that whoever reads the document is clear about roles and responsibilities and this, in the two aspects that we've just looked at, could have been clearer and on one level could be described as misleading?

**Dame Harries**: I think I would agree with you. I mean, there are two things I would say: one is I notice the date is 2014, and I now have the same problem at UKHSA, every time an organisation changes you're having to go back and work through documents to try and make them work with the ones before. And it's not just your own organisation, it's the other pieces of the machinery that have changed at the same time, and they're sometimes changing as you're trying to update your document. So I agree with you. I am less concerned in practice that that sentence would have affected how individuals responded. They would have worked to the NIERP and the systems in place.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Because, as you may or may not be aware, the NSC(THRC) was retired in 2018 and became completely disbanded by 2019. So in fact, as we get towards the time that the pandemic hit, that organisation was no longer in existence.

**Dame Harries**: I agree with you, I think it's unhelpful. We're probably -- I should suspect PHE is not the only organisation with outdated documents and it's why, for things like the NIERP particularly -- which is the backbone of response, and I think you can see that through the evidence that's there -- it is proactively updated after each incident.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I want to move away from this document now -- we can take that down, please, thank you -- and just ask you about a plan, a UKHSA plan for MERS. Is there one in force other than a draft interim response plan that was created some time ago? Do you know whether there's a final plan in force?

**Dame Harries**: There is guidance and it would be handled along an HCID pathway, so effectively the practical application is there.

**Counsel Inquiry**: How is it viewed in terms of the level of concern that MERS poses?

**Dame Harries**: So MERS is on the HCID list. So, I mean, in practice, what that means is if we have ten cases of something else, we say: is this a cluster? Does it look unusual? If there's one case of MERS, somebody's on the phone to me immediately and the CMO knows and the HCID pathway goes in and the HCID network is activated. So -- and we have seen that happen. We've had a Lassa fever case recently, we've had MERS.

So I'm very confident -- I mean, you can't -- you will never secure 100% confidence, but it has been rehearsed, and the 2018 example of that is that that case was managed well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right, thank you.

In terms of planning for an HCID or Disease X pandemic, Professor Oliver in her witness statement to us has confirmed that Public Health England was not involved in any programmes of work related to specific planning for a pandemic caused by any pathogen other than influenza -- and indeed that accords with other evidence that the Inquiry has received -- or indeed any pathogen agnostic planning.

**Dame Harries**: Yes. Can I be invited to continue?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, please do.

**Dame Harries**: So, yes, strictly to -- you said, that's my understanding. But it does go back a little bit to trying to fit what we have -- the way I see what we have, from a clinical perspective -- and I think in many ways probably reflecting what Sir Patrick and Sir Chris Whitty said -- is that we have a respiratory virus plan, currently, I think, because the national strategic risk assessment says you have to use an example, and that is geared to flu, and then we have an HCID pathway which is smaller but has very high protection. And I'm probably pre-empting some further questions.

My view is that the flu plan is actually a pretty good one. I turned round and thought I'd ask the question the other way round: if I was going to choose an example, because that's what the risk assessment says I must do, what other example of a respiratory virus with pandemic potential would I use? And there wouldn't -- I would still use flu because that's the history to date. But what it doesn't have is what I would call a sensitivity analysis. It doesn't do the bits that says: well, what if this flu virus had a longer incubation period or this flu virus transmitted asymptomatically for 50% of cases?

So the actual sort of structures of the pathways, whether it's a new virus or not, feel okay to me, but that's the bit that's missing at a national level and that would have got us to a consideration of, you know, what's -- what is -- had we planned for more asymptomatic transmission or a containment phase, as the Hine report suggested.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, but also doesn't it have an effect on decisions in terms of pandemic stockpiles and clinical countermeasures?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Because there was only a pandemic influenza plan, the planning, the practical planning for pandemic stockpiles and clinical countermeasures followed that plan and so in terms of antivirals they were entirely suitable for an influenza pandemic but, as it happened, not for the pandemic that hit us?

**Dame Harries**: To an extent, yes, but, I mean, if we did a sensitivity analysis that said, "We're going to have a new virus that's got 100% asymptomatic transmission, we'll only know if we go into it", we'd all be walking around in PPE every day of our lives. So there is a limit to what that stockpile might ever do, and it's not an unreasonable assumption to put it somewhere around the boundaries that I think it was. But I do think this, however you call it -- as I say, I call it a sensitivity analysis -- we didn't think -- it should have been flexed to potential characteristics of the virus. The underlying plan is fine, but that isn't of course -- this is the problem, that's not what the NSRA, I think, allows PHE or the Department of Health to do. It gets very specific on -- it wants to know how many cases, and we have the same thing with Covid where I will be asked, you know, what is your trigger point? But if you have a virus that is behaving -- is a new virus or you don't know how it's going to behave, specifying a trigger point is not the right thing to do; you need to leave your mind open to what it might do.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What are PHE's responsibilities in terms of stockpiling clinical countermeasures and PPE?

**Dame Harries**: So -- what were they?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, of course.

**Dame Harries**: Sorry, because I'm sort of jumping between organisations and actually I wasn't responsible personally for PHE.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No, of course. And, sorry, just to remind ourselves that we are dealing with the period of time running up to --

**Dame Harries**: Exactly.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- the pandemic, so that's why I'd counted the question in terms of --

**Dame Harries**: Yes, exactly.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- PHE.

**Dame Harries**: So PHE had a VCR team, it was a vaccine and countermeasures response team --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: -- which was not there to set the parameters of the stockpile, it was there to do the procurement and manage the processing of it and make sure it was stored effectively and that it turned over effectively. And it's quite a complex procurement and management system which -- I realise you have a very, very long chapter on that, but important because there is another part in Department of Health which links with it, and the actual parameters of the stockpile are set through the Department of Health and with input from groups such as NERVTAG.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

I have two topics left. One is the health of the population prior to Covid-19 and the extent to which pre-existing inequalities and vulnerabilities were considered and accounted for in pandemic planning and preparations.

Was it part of PHE's functions to assess the nation's health from time to time and also to seek to improve it?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right, and what assessment would you give to the Inquiry about the state of the nation's health in the months running up to the Covid pandemic hitting?

**Dame Harries**: I've read Sir Michael Marmot's report and I would agree with the broad headline. I'll put some caveats. The principle, which I think many people have established and we know, is that infectious disease will follow those areas of vulnerability, and that's -- and I don't just mean clinical vulnerability, although that is important separately. It will be the vulnerability, combined vulnerability of socio-economic deprivation and things like housing and, you know, whether people have got good jobs. These are all protective measures for good health outcomes.

So I broadly agree. I -- and he says himself -- I don't agree necessarily that the causative element, the link between the timeframe for austerity and the burden of disease in the population, it's very difficult to draw that conclusion directly. It's possible, but even he acknowledges that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right, okay. So as a principle?

**Dame Harries**: But as a principle, people who are in the more deprived areas will suffer from -- they're more adversely affected by infectious diseases but also by underlying health conditions as well, which combined then creates a major problem.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right. Although you question the timescale, do you accept what Professors Marmot and Bambra said about the decline in the ten years running up to the Covid pandemic?

**Dame Harries**: I think what I'm saying is the object of evidence of decline you can measure, health and socio-economic deprivation and burden of disease. The bit that's not so easy to do is draw the direct link. They were making a link directly between austerity and (inaudible) --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. No, no.

**Dame Harries**: -- and some people will and others won't, and I'm just saying it's difficult to draw that. But definitely the shape of the curve, if you like --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dame Harries**: -- is clear, it's evidential.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Over the ten years leading up to the pandemic?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

May we put up on the screen, please, the report from the Institute of Government which is entitled "How fit were public services for the coronavirus?" Thank you very much. If we go immediately, please, to page 11, I would just like to look with you, please, Dame Jenny, at the chart at the top of the page.

This is a piece of work that has been prepared by the institute and they have through various pieces of evidence received, sought to draw conclusions in relation to how prepared and resilient public services were at the start of the crisis, providing red for a level of organisational preparedness that was below par or failed, amber for something that was acceptable, and green for good.

We can see that on the left-hand side the categories are split into "Preparedness" and "Resilience", and each of those into "Quality of plans", "Ability to implement plans", "Performance going into the crisis", "Staff", "Buildings" and "Equipment".

Then along the horizontal axis and in the columns coming down from the top, we see "The NHS": "Hospitals" and "General practice"; "Local government": "Local emergency support services", "Adult social care", "Children's social care"; "Education": "Schools". And then "The criminal justice system", on the right-hand side, separated into "Police", "Criminal courts" and "Prisons".

The resilience of hospitals wasn't good, but if we look further to the middle of the graph we can see that, both in relation to preparedness and resilience, adult social care appears to have failed.

Are those concerns reflected in your experience of these organisations running up to the time that the pandemic hit?

**Dame Harries**: I think I will have to refrain from comment, I'm a scientist, this looks completely subjective and I have absolutely no idea on how the ratings have been derived.

I mean, I can make a few comments, but just looking at it, for example, hospitals, ability to implement plans if you have no staff, or we've said that the EPRR arrangements are low, feels a slightly strange conclusion.

I think in adult social care as well. I mean, it is one of the big problems for social care -- and I might add I have personal family experience of this and used to support commissioning in local authorities -- so I think, notwithstanding what's on there, I would agree that social care was a high-risk area and one of the difficulties -- and this goes to buildings and equipment and what have you -- is it is a largely privately provided service, so the difficulties of ensuring that there are plans that are fit or that people who are running those services, their responsibility at the start of the pandemic to understand infection control and have PPE ready for their staff is really challenging, and I think that has come out through the pandemic.

What I do know is they are an extremely vulnerable group of individuals and I think, you know, recognise -- and I personally always see this as a continuum for medical care, you can't just exclude one side of it. But I would -- I'm afraid would have to refrain from comment on the rest, because it's not very evidential.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, I had understood that you'd been provided with the report provided by the Institute of Government prior to today, and you would have understood that the findings are based on extensive desk research, analysis of government data, interviews with civil servants, frontline staff, representative bodies and other experts.

**Dame Harries**: But it still has a subjective element to it. I mean, things that I could comment on: for example, prisons actually in the first wave of the pandemic had excellent outcomes, and in fact PHE is a WHO collaborating centre for prison health, and you can see a marked contrast between the outcomes there in the first wave and the US. But, you know, I still think by the time you put those together somebody has to knit them. So I agree with you in the overarching. The red column in the middle absolutely stands out and I would agree with it.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Finally I want to give you the opportunity, Dame Jenny, to provide us with your experience and knowledge in terms of what we have been through, your evidence today, but also any aspects that we haven't touched upon and allow you to assist the Chair in terms of any recommendations that she may want to consider in terms of lessons learned.

I know that in particular you were impressed with evidence that has been given to the Inquiry about the possibility of recommending the appointment of a resilience minister.

**Dame Harries**: Yes, thank you. It wasn't an idea that I thought I would warm to when somebody first suggested it, but actually when I look back through my experience and when you look at what I'm calling the wicked issues, one of the difficulties is that these -- for example, infrastructure for maintaining very high containment level laboratories, or social care agenda -- cannot be tackled even by a very willing -- and I might add Department of Health have worked very hard with us -- individual department. It needs somebody, and you see it happening in incident response, which is why Sir Oliver Letwin's contribution was very interesting. I don't say that with a political slant at all. It was very evident that he understood what happened and how you needed to make things work.

So I tend to agree. I would add a note of caution, which is: just like the rest of the system, churn in the system is a major problem, we lose understanding, we lose connections, and I've had four different ministers in the Department of Health, and you can start to see the difference of people who understand the problems and then clearly it turns to other things, which we -- you know, is inevitable.

So I think that minister almost needs to stay with it for the whole of the Parliamentary session, almost, for it to maintain the infrastructure for the country.

The second point I would make is to do with the science. Again, Sir Patrick Vallance said this, but I think we are -- and I think David Heymann said it, we're missing what the opportunities are. This all sounds very depressing and where everything may or may not have gone wrong, but for UKHSA, one of the positive things about having a science -- more science-focused organisation is to work upstream. So in contrast to perhaps where we have been, it's allowing me to put in more systematic horizon scanning and surveillance, we're already starting to work with industry and we've taken in -- so somebody I think mentioned: where has the vaccine taskforce gone? The answer is: I've got it and I'm working with it upfront, because we have the opportunity with new vaccine products, new diagnostic tests, to actually do one was things which was missing here, which was put equal focus on prevention for the next pandemic. And we have new tools.

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you.

My Lady, that completes my questions. I know that provisional permission has been given to Ms Claire Mitchell King's Counsel on behalf of the Scottish Covid Bereaved to ask a question, I think one or two questions on the topic of Dame Jenny Harries' role as DCMO for England, and may she do that now?

**Lady Hallett**: Of course.

Ms Mitchell.

Questions From Ms Mitchell KC

**Ms Mitchell**: I'm obliged.

Dame Jenny, we have heard that you were Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England 2019 to 2021, and in your evidence today you've spoken about connections between governments and organisations and also the interconnectivity and the benefits of interconnectivity.

I'd like to ask you, please, about the connections between individuals in the roles of the four nations, and particularly your role when you were Deputy Chief Medical Officer.

During your time as Deputy Chief Medical Officer, did you have meetings or discussions with the other Deputy Chief Medical Officers in their roles in the four nations?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: Can you tell me, was any of the work that was done in those discussions and meetings related to pandemic planning or pandemic preparedness?

**Dame Harries**: So during the Covid pandemic, most of it is obviously -- I mean, we're moving on to the next phase, almost, so I'm just looking for a signal as to how I should answer this.

**Lady Hallett**: No, we're asking about -- I think Ms Mitchell is asking about what was the work done in collaboration with the devolved administrations in relation to planning and preparedness, not response.

**Dame Harries**: In that case, I might decline slightly, because -- just to explain, my -- although it may not appear that to the nation, my Deputy -- there are usually two Deputy Chief Medical Officers supporting the English CMO. One of them did the health protection role, which was Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, and the other one is the health improvement role. So actually when I joined the department it was to support work on tobacco control, obesity, physical exercise and that sort of agenda. So I would not have expected to be involved in the planning for pandemics. It would be more with the health protection DCMO.

**Ms Mitchell**: I see, but one of your colleagues would be the person that we posed that question to then?

**Dame Harries**: Yes.

**Ms Mitchell**: I'm obliged.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Mitchell.

Thank you very much, Dame Jenny, I think that concludes the questions -- thank you very much to our stenographer for keeping going -- I'm very grateful to you for all your help and for your interesting thoughts.

**The Witness**: Thank you.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, and 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, please.

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you, my Lady.

*(5.00 pm)*

*(The hearing adjourned until 10 am on Tuesday, 27 June 2023)*
