*DR JENNIFER DIXON (affirmed).*

Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry

**Mr Keith**: Could you give the Inquiry your full name, please.

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, Jennifer Dixon.

**Lead Inquiry**: Dr Dixon, thank you for your provision of a witness statement to this Inquiry. It's dated 14 April. There it is, INQ000183420. I believe that you've signed the last page and signed the declaration of truth that the statement contains.

Dr Dixon, whilst you give evidence, could I ask you to keep your voice up, so that we may clearly hear what you have to say, and also try to speak as slowly as you can in order to assist our stenographer.

You are, we believe, the chief executive of The Health Foundation. I'll come back to what that is in a moment, but it's a position that you've held since 2013. Before that, were you the chief executive of The Nuffield Trust, a post you held from 2008 to 2013?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: A director of policy at The King's Fund, and also a policy adviser to the chief executive of the NHS between 1998 and 2000?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: By training, you are a medic, you hold a masters in public health and a PhD in health services research from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: Are you also a non-executive board member of the United Kingdom Health Security Agency, a position to which you were appointed in April 2022?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: But you give evidence today, so that we may be clear about it, solely on behalf of The Health Foundation?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: So what does The Health Foundation do?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: The Health Foundation is an endowed independent charitable foundation and we have a mission to improve health and healthcare for the UK population. We do that --

**Lead Inquiry**: Slow down, please, Dr Dixon.

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Sorry.

We fund projects and research to try to improve the health and care for the people of the UK, and we carry out research also.

**Lead Inquiry**: We are most interested in the research that you do, because much of your witness statement is concerned with the provision of facts and figures which we wish you to talk about.

To what extent does the foundation commission and use evidence? Is that the majority of your work? Are you, I suppose, what might be called a "think tank", insofar as you provide to the public information and data about the structure and operation of our healthcare structures?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: More than half of our work is commissioned and carried out in research, but we give out other funds to, for example, improve -- for fellowships and suchlike.

**Lead Inquiry**: When you commission research, are your researchers and your experts in-house or do you commission external analysis?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Both.

**Lead Inquiry**: Are those reports and is that analysis directed at the public or is it directed at government or to the healthcare systems themselves?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: It's to both, to -- it's all three, but mostly it would be to leaders and policymakers.

**Lead Inquiry**: May I ask, are you a respected organisation to whose views the government pays particular attention?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: We are a well respected organisation because we are known to be impartial, do high quality work and are entirely independent. And on the question of whether the government listens, whether we have influence, that's variable.

**Lead Inquiry**: You are obviously independent, but to whom is the foundation accountable? So is there a body or are there individuals to whom you are accountable as an organisation?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, we are accountable to the board of trustees, which is an entirely independent board, and we receive all our money from -- our income from the endowment, with a small amount extra coming from commissioned work.

**Lead Inquiry**: Are you therefore regulated by the Charity Commission as well?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: We are, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

The Inquiry doesn't believe, from your witness statement, that the foundation had a role or exercised a role in relation to the pre-pandemic preparedness system, so you didn't engage with the government when it drew up its relevant plans and procedures for pandemic planning, and nor, I think, did any of your work focus on the state of the preparedness of the United Kingdom pre-pandemic?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: That is correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: But where you are able to provide specific detail is in relation to, bluntly, the facts and figures relating to the state of the health and care systems in the United Kingdom as it entered, as they entered the pandemic, and now, and also facts and figures relating to the general health of the population, and in particular the impact on those who suffer from inequalities in terms of the receipt of health and social care?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, that's correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. Let's look then at those two areas, dealing with the health and care systems first.

In the decade leading up to the pandemic, so in the decade prior to January 2020, what can The Health Foundation say in relation to the reductions in the levels of spending on public services generally in the United Kingdom?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: So public services per person reduced by 13%, of the order of 13%, over that decade.

**Lead Inquiry**: You've provided us with that headline figure. Is that a figure drawn from research and analysis and no doubt a series of papers and projects which the foundation prepared over time?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: You haven't just produced that figure as a result of a request from the Inquiry that you address that particular topic?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: That's correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: That was a question revolving exclusively around the level of spending on public services. But what about the NHS? The Inquiry has received evidence already that parts of the NHS spending were protected, and there's obviously a divide between money that is spent on day-to-day services within the NHS as well as money spent on infrastructure and the like. So, dealing with those areas in turn, was core NHS spending protected to any extent during that decade prior to 2020?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Core NHS spending was protected relative to other public services, but over that decade the NHS received about half or slightly less than half than it would have normally expected to receive per annum compared to a long-run average.

**Lead Inquiry**: That's an average of spending, annual spending in the United Kingdom, is it?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, real terms growth on average, long run, is 3.6%. The NHS grew 1.4% over that decade.

**Lead Inquiry**: When you say it grew, you mean the spending grew as opposed to the NHS growing in size?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: The spending grew, yes, by 1.4% real terms per year.

**Lead Inquiry**: The comparative figure that you provide, that is to say the amount of spending or the amount of increase that it could have gone up annually but did not, is that a figure which necessarily takes account of any demand in the receipt of healthcare services?

So presumably the NHS budgets, on the basis that there is a demand for its services and there is a cost to providing or meeting that demand on the part of the population across the United Kingdom, did that level of spending, constrained as it was, keep pace with the demand in the population for NHS services?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: No, and normally the increases given to the NHS are made irrespective of demand, and there has not been long-term projections of demand in order to assess how much spending is required.

**Lead Inquiry**: So it would be wrong to assume that the NHS, as a healthcare organisation, tries to receive enough by way of its budget to meet a projected demand; it has to make do with whatever it receives?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: That is correct. It's more linked to the state of the economy.

**Lead Inquiry**: During that time, were there changes in the pressures placed on the NHS operationally? That is to say, changes in the demand for NHS services, demands for improvements in its infrastructure, demands in terms of the specific health services which the NHS provides? So, for example, cancer treatment and the like.

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes. So the pressures on the National Health will be growing because of increases in population size, changes in population structure with the ageing of the population, with --

**Lead Inquiry**: Slow down, sorry, Dr Dixon. If you can start that sentence again.

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: So the pressures on the NHS will be growing because of increases in the population, because of changes in the composition of the population because of the ageing of the population, and also the changes in the ill health of the population, which were all growing over that period.

There will also be what we call supply-side pressures coming from price increases, but also in terms of needing more technologies to improve care.

So the kinds of figures that the -- the growth that the NHS received over that decade was not enough to modernise the NHS nor indeed to keep pace with demand.

And you see this very clearly -- we might get on to this -- with capital spend as well.

**Lead Inquiry**: We'll come to that in a moment.

So although NHS spending then was protected, and although there were increases in real terms year by year, because of the particular demands of the NHS, the need to modernise, the need to keep up with the demand from the population, the amounts of the increase could not be enough to match those demands?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: No, they were not.

And if I may, just to give a comparison, if we had spent per capita in 2019 the same as France, the NHS would be receiving an extra £40 billion per year, and if we'd compared ourselves with Germany we'd be spending another £70 billion a year. That's on a roughly £150 billion budget.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, it's self-evident, of course, that those sorts of political choices are not for this Inquiry or for --

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry, just before we go on -- sorry, can you come back to that, Mr Keith?

**Mr Keith**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: You say if we'd spent as much as France per capita. How do you equate a system in France, which is very different from an NHS in England? How do you get the figures of what's spent?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: We just look at total spending in France, whether it's public or private, and we look at public or private spending in the UK, and we divide by the population size.

**Lady Hallett**: So when you talk about we'd be spending an extra £40 billion a year on the NHS, that is funding in France that would be both private and public funding?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: Right.

**Mr Keith**: It must also follow, Dr Dixon, that those sorts of figures are provided on the basis of an assumption of a single overarching budget --

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- for the NHS. So in addition to my Lady's point, it may well be that sources of funding in Germany, for example, come in part from central government, in part from federal government and in part from state government?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: That's true.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

So the point I was going to make to you is those are self-evidently political choices that have to be made, and of course they don't take account of and they're not meant to take account of different sources of funding and the state structures which may be in place in each country.

But evidence has been received by the Inquiry, in particular from Jeremy Hunt, which you may have seen, that over that period in fact the number of doctors and nurses in the NHS went up significantly. It may seem very obvious and is self-evident, but is that because -- or, rather, your figures are what they are notwithstanding that there can be significant improvements in some parts of the system, by way of additional or extra expenditure on doctors and nurses, but other parts of the system may be relatively constrained or may indeed suffer reductions in levels of funding, which is why overall there may be a reduction across the system as a whole?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, there were workforce increases, but over the decade full-time equivalents of NHS staff grew only 1% across that period, and in fact the number of fully qualified GPs, for example, fell over that period. So we were coming from a very low base, and if, again, if you compare us with other European countries, we have many fewer doctors per thousand population, fewer nurses, fewer everything, to be honest. So although it may be true that the absolute rise was there over that period, it was low and it was on a very low base.

**Lead Inquiry**: The two rises in fact of which Jeremy Hunt spoke in particular were rises in two particular years. You of course are producing figures over a whole decade?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Over ten years, yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

Turning to adult social care, what can you say in general terms over the decade about the levels of funding across the system as a whole, and the levels in the workforce across the system as a whole?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yeah. So the funding per capita, which is the best, probably, measure, reduced by 12% over that decade, funding in social care, and the shortages remained pretty static over that period, and they're --

**Lead Inquiry**: Workforce shortages you mean?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: In social care, at 120,000, which is around 10% of the workforce.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, addressing your two answers in order, the first answer, the level of funding over that time and the reduction in the funding per person, is that an objective level of funding? Is that an objective number, or is it a number which is adjusted to take account of the additional needs of persons in the social care system, and in particular the fact that our population is ageing generally?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: This will just be a per capita figure. If you adjust for the needs of the population, then the reductions will be greater.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that because in these calculations it's implicit that if the population has greater demands, it's going to cost more to meet those demands?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: That's exactly right. And again, like in NHS funding, overall the overall funding in the decade was less than half of the longer run average.

**Lead Inquiry**: How was The Health Foundation able to compute figures about the levels of workforce in the adult social care sector and on the amount of funding per capita given the evidence the Inquiry has already heard about the fragmentation in the system and the sheer difficulty of trying to quantify the various moving parts in the adult social care sector?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: So there will be central figures on funding which will be collected and we will use those figures, we won't directly collect the figures ourselves, they'll be from official sources. And similarly with the workforce, that is true, there are organisations that collect information such as Skills for Care on the overall numbers of the workforce.

**Lead Inquiry**: So you haven't sent researchers out to each care home in order to find out how many people work there and how many people receive care; there are central government supplies of data?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: There will be central government supplies. Although, as I think other witnesses have said, there is significant churn in this sector, so the numbers will be estimated.

**Lead Inquiry**: Evidence has been given of what has been termed the fragmentation of the health and care -- the adult social care system in particular. What do you understand that phrase to mean?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Well, in the social care system, unlike the NHS, there is no centralised authority, it's not a national care service. So there will be 150 local authorities that will be commissioning care, and there's upwards of 14,000 different social care providers, many of whom will be very small. So I suspect that's what they mean by fragmentation.

**Lead Inquiry**: When you say there are upwards of 15,000 organisations providing care, does that mean -- does that include nursing homes and care homes?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: It's both, yes, indeed.

**Lead Inquiry**: They are the providers of social care to the persons in those homes?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: In the homes, and then there will be domiciliary care as well, provided by a range of different agencies.

**Lead Inquiry**: Are those domiciliary carers included in your figures of 15,000-odd?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, they will be.

**Lead Inquiry**: How do the governance and accountability arrangements work for the adult social care sector? Are they split between a number of different entities in government?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: There are three government departments that deal with social care, and 150 local authorities. So there's no one overarching department. I suppose the lead department would be the Department of Health.

**Lead Inquiry**: And Social Care?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: And Social Care, yes, sorry.

**Lead Inquiry**: In your statement at paragraph 19, you say that:

"Data availability and quality was a significant barrier to the pandemic response in some areas, for instance, the lack of a care home register; difficulties in identifying care homes residents in routine data; and lack of reliable data presented difficulties for local authorities ..."

Without going into the operational response of the sector, do those difficulties reflect the absence of a well ordered, well organised, pre-existing pre-pandemic system for the collation of data?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, and in particular this is the case in social care, where you can imagine, as you can see, thousands of providers each with care home residents, each -- where the residents are not necessarily -- could be churning over themselves in terms of, you know, a certain level of throughput, and staff as well, 40% turnover in a year. So very hard to track both staff and patients, and there's no national care record for social care. There isn't actually even a national minimum data set, although there is work that is ongoing to develop that.

Then linking social care data with NHS sources of data is also immensely difficult.

**Lead Inquiry**: Are you able to say to what extent the systems for the supply of data have significantly changed since the pandemic or been the subject of updating or review by the government?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: No. I think work is being done to try to get a minimum data set together. It's still ongoing. But just as in the NHS, the social care sector will be undercapitalised in terms of the money available to -- or spent, I would say, on developing IT systems that can track individual patients. And --

**Lead Inquiry**: Sorry, just pause there.

Is it implicit in that answer that any improvement in the data systems has to be funded out of money in the adult social care system or the NHS system itself, as opposed to coming from an external source of funds?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: So I -- it doesn't necessarily follow. I mean, clearly there will be local authority funded patients in care homes and there will be privately funded patients, and care homes -- many of them are -- some of them are large enough to be able to afford such infrastructure, so it's not necessarily the local authority's role to do that, but the smaller ones simply won't have the money and there will be many three, four-bedded care homes who cannot afford detailed IT or the staff to analyse or indeed enter the data.

**Lead Inquiry**: So the nub of it is that a sensible and well ordered overarching system of data supply is going to have to be funded by central government or at least non-care home providers, perhaps local government, and it's got to be imposed centrally as opposed to being something that can be requested of individual care and nursing home providers?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Well, I think there would have to be some more incentives to encourage or, indeed, mandate providers of social care to collect data.

Some social care providers are owned by some very large businesses who will have the capital funds to be able to do that, but maybe they need incentives or, indeed, regulatory apparatus to encourage them to do so.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right, thank you, that's very helpful.

Turning to the second part of your statement and the part that deals with population health and inequalities, you say:

"... staying healthy depends on much more than healthcare: people's health is shaped by the circumstances in which they are born, grow, live, work and age -- often referred to as the 'wider determinants of health'."

Does it follow, Dr Dixon, that in order to improve resilience for the future it is necessary to improve the general health of the population as long as dealing on a micro level with whatever may be done in terms of preparedness and planning?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, I think the resilience of the -- as we saw in the pandemic, certain groups were more affected and more vulnerable, and that will be a feature not just of their levels of exposure but also their levels of underlying health. And we know that in the decade before the pandemic that life expectancy was stalling more in Britain than in other countries apart from the United States, and that there were significant inequalities with some areas of the country -- some populations, their life expectancy actually reducing.

**Lead Inquiry**: Beyond the self-evident concern that that statistic gives rise to, why does a fall in mortality rate -- why does a fall in life expectancy matter in the context of resilience and planning and preparedness? Is it because if life expectancy is reducing and health inequalities are worsening, there is more to be done, there is a greater step to be navigated before those parts of the population can be put into a state of proper resilience?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, I mean, I think people will be more vulnerable to any external sort of infectious disease if they're in a more vulnerable state. For example, if you have chronic diseases, obesity and so on -- and as we know obesity has increased, chronic diseases have increased in the population -- so individuals with those will be more susceptible, as we saw with Covid-19. So it is important to try to reduce avoidable ill health for the long term if we want to build resilience here.

**Lead Inquiry**: You refer in your statement to something you describe as long-term conditions, LTCs; what are they?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: They will be conditions that are non-infectious, for which there is no particular cure, but they are rumbling and chronic. So hypertension, for example, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, would be an example, heart disease, and in poorer groups in society those chronic disease begin when people are in their early 50s and in the wealthiest parts of our society they begin 20 years later, in people's early 70s. So you can see that particularly people in deprived -- socio-economically deprived groups will have more susceptibility to all sorts of illness, including infectious disease, if they begin with chronic disease that early.

**Lead Inquiry**: Are LTCs also more prevalent in some ethnic minority groups?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, they are. Well, it depends what it is, but, for example, diabetes is more common in the South Asian community.

**Lead Inquiry**: So in order to improve resilience, one has to first or one has to also improve health in a general sense, address these comorbidities of the pandemic, the long-term conditions, and recognise that they are more prevalent in some parts of society than others?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, that's absolutely right.

**Lead Inquiry**: Turning then to public health funding, the Inquiry's received quite an extensive amount of evidence about how public health is provided to the population, which parts of local government, indeed, and directors of public health are concerned with public health services.

Are there figures in existence which show general levels of funding at central and also local government level for public health services?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes, there are such figures.

**Lead Inquiry**: Over the last decade what do they show?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: They show -- well, our figures show that in the last decade public health funding was reduced per head by 22% and those are the overall headline figures.

**Lead Inquiry**: That's in relation to -- is that central government or central government and local government?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: I think it's both. I'll check, but I think it's both.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that -- that's an overarching figure for the whole of the last decade?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: So from beginning to end it's reduced by 22%?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: It has, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: And more in deprived areas than not.

**Lead Inquiry**: You conclude your witness statement by setting out a number of lessons for future pandemics and/or public health emergencies, which lessons you frankly acknowledge can only have been formulated with the benefit of hindsight.

Are all the lessons and the points that you seek to make related in some shape or form to the evidence that you've given about the reduction, general reduction, in levels of funding and the need for greater resilience, greater health improvement and a particular focus on those parts of society where there have been the greatest reductions in both funding and in health?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: More or less. I would say that our -- the statement, and indeed today's conversation focused a lot on what I would call tangible assets that are important for resilience, but there are also a lot of intangible assets that need to be there, and by that I mean the kind of expertise, relationships that need to be built, skills, data, staff to analyse the data, all those -- public trust, there's a whole set of intangibles that I think it's worth looking at. Indeed, those relationships can be disrupted and skills can be disrupted by reforms, the 2022 -- sorry, 2012 reforms, for example, and also, not that my statement refers to this, but Brexit as well.

So if you have a constant reform agenda, that can disrupt quite a lot of relationships that you need to have built and stable in order to be resilient in the face of shocks.

**Lead Inquiry**: Those references in the main, for example to the impact of preparations for a no-deal exit or perhaps from Brexit itself, but we're not going to go into that, the intangibles of lack of a pre-existing and effective data supply system, the reductions in the overall levels of funding and so on and so forth, are all in the past, they're all retrospective. Do you in your statement try to identify areas going forward where work can be done in order to try to bring about a more resilient United Kingdom?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Yes. So obviously we talked about investment, I think that's important. To avoid excessive distracting reforms that can disrupt relationships and skills and form attrition of experienced staff. I think much more support for social care, investment in particular. We really do need a serious cross-government strategy to improve health and reduce inequalities in the way that we simply haven't over the last ten, 15 years. A lot more investment in data and infrastructure and the analysts to support them. There was -- in some cases we had data that NHS England and the Department of Health did not have during the pandemic, because of a lack of investment. And work on public trust, I think those are some of the biggest areas: public trust in authority of handling the pandemic but also in -- in -- confidence in using data and linking it correctly to respond to threats.

**Lead Inquiry**: That last or that penultimate topic, public trust, is not something that features to a great extent in your statement. Why is the maintenance or the promulgation of trust in public bodies relevant to the health of a population or health improvement or to dealing with the inequalities in society and the health determinants that you have described? Why does it matter that there is trust in government?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: Well, I think in a pandemic situation you want people to be able to take notice of information that may help them reduce their risks, and also you really want to encourage trust in vaccines and to reduce vaccine hesitancy where that's based on misinformation, so you need trust and authority in both those counts.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that relevant to a system of preparedness and planning as well as to a system of vaccine provision?

**Dr Jennifer Dixon**: It's absolutely part of the building up of intangible assets which lead to resilience.

**Mr Keith**: Thank you very much.

**The Witness**: Thank you.

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, I don't believe that there are any applications for Rule 10 questions for Dr Dixon, so that concludes her evidence, unless you have any questions.

**Lady Hallett**: No, I don't have any questions.

Thank you very much indeed, Dr Dixon, for your help.

**The Witness**: Thank you.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, the next and, in fact, final witness of fact is Michael Adamson, the chief executive of the British Red Cross.
