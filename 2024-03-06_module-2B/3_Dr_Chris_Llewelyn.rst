*DR CHRIS LLEWELYN (affirmed).*

Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Ms Paisley**: Could you commence, please, by giving your full name.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Chris Llewelyn.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Dr Llewelyn, thank you for your attendance and for assisting the Inquiry. As you give evidence, could you please remember to keep your voice up and we will take it slowly as we have stenographers taking a note for the transcript.

You have kindly provided two witness statements for this module. The first is INQ000273741, dated 6 September 2023. The second is INQ000410950, dated 2 February 2024. And you have signed both of those statements; is that right?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah, that's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can you please confirm that the contents of those statements are true to the best of your knowledge and belief?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah, that's true.

**Counsel Inquiry**: It's right to say that you also provided both written and oral evidence to Module 1 of this Inquiry?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah, I did.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And we're very grateful for your continued assistance.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Thank you.

**Counsel Inquiry**: By way of your professional background and involvement with the Welsh Local Government Association, or the WLGA if you're content that we refer to it as that, in 2002 you joined the WLGA as director of lifelong learning, leisure and information. You then became the deputy chief executive in 2010, and you have been the chief executive since January 2019. Is that correct?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah. That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of the operation of the WLGA, then, it was established in 1996; is that correct? Membership is voluntary, but in Wales all 22 local authorities are members, along with all three fire and rescue authorities, and the three national parks authorities are associate members.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You explain in your statement that the WLGA works to give local government a strong and credible voice within national government. It's a cross-party organisation, and seeks to operate on the basis of consensus where leaders and senior members from different political groups are involved in the business of the WLGA and in representing the collective voice of local government.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can I then begin by asking you about the period of January to March 2020, but before we go into particular detail, could you please give a broad overview of the general role played by the WLGA over the pandemic in Wales.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah. The -- as you've mentioned, the WLGA represents the 22 unitary authorities in Wales. The national parks and the fire authorities are associate members as well. And what we endeavour to do in all the work that we do is to give local government an effective voice, act as an interface between the 22 local authorities and all tiers of government, primarily the Welsh Government, but the UK Government as well. And we take the view that we deliver the best outcomes for the people of Wales if all tiers of government work as closely together as possible.

We also believe that decisions about how services are run and provided locally, that decisions about those services need to be made as close to the point of delivery as possible.

So throughout the Covid period our work was informed by that approach, that we were located in the most appropriate position to act as that interface between the 22 local authorities and the Welsh Government, but other tiers of government and other national partners as well.

And in a sense, wherever and whenever we felt that there was a need or there was an opportunity to provide that local voice, then we'd tried as effectively as we could provide that during the course of the Covid crisis.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just generally thinking then about the role that was played, was the role as you envisaged it might be in a crisis such as this or was it something different?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: No, I think it was -- it was very different from what we'd anticipated. The reality is that no one had been through an experience like this before. Although we engaged in some aspects of civil contingencies preparation, I don't think we'd envisaged a crisis as deep or as long as this, and in a sense we were developing processes and procedures as the crisis progressed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can we then begin to look at some specific dates, and you provide a chronology in your witness statement, which we don't need to go to, but on that list there is a record of a meeting on 12 March 2020, and the event is described as "COVID 19 Local Government Meeting (First Minister, Minister for Health and several leaders)". Was that the first meeting where Covid-19 was formally discussed between the local government and the WLGA?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: It would have been the first meeting where there were discussions at a political level. One of the things we emphasise as an association is the primacy of politics, that it's important that elected members speak to elected members, and in this instance it was a case of Welsh Government ministers and the First Minister speaking for the first time to our elected leaders.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Is the date of 12 March, thinking back, quite late?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah, I think it is. There had been some internal discussions within the WLGA prior to that. We had a briefing from Public Health Wales on 28 February. I think it's fair to say that at the time leaders were underwhelmed, if -- it may be fair to say there was a sense of disquiet and maybe an expectation that there would be a greater sense of urgency.

**Counsel Inquiry**: That comes on to my next question. In terms of that meeting itself, what is your recollection of the mood?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Of the meeting on the 12th?

**Counsel Inquiry**: On 12 March.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Of being very -- profound, serious and almost sombre meeting.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can I then, please, bring up a document which is the minutes of a chief executives' teleconference on 20 March 2020.

INQ000089874.

On page 1 we can see the title "Education", and we see there:

"WG definition of key workers published this afternoon -- no discussion with WLGA beforehand. WLGA been advising LAs to follow UK Govt guidance initially, as this is what the public will expect."

Is that a specific instance that caused a problem or a concern that you can recall?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I think it caused a concern, and it -- I suppose it highlights a theme which was to develop throughout the crisis, because, as I mentioned earlier, on the one hand -- the association tries to create a consensus wherever possible and we try to get different tiers of government to work as effectively together as possible, so there was a sense that consistent messaging, even at this early stage, from all tiers of government was important. But at the same time there was a need for local operational delivery understanding to inform strategic thinking and strategic policy. So I think that that's -- that's the concern there, that -- the lack of discussion beforehand.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Staying on this document, then, if we can go to page 2, please, and it's the middle of the page, and it's concerns about the shielding scheme, and we can see there it says:

"... potentially huge numbers locally.

"LAs have not seen/had input in the letter.

"Concerns around number of residents who will require support from the council ..."

So before we go into this, to what extent were local authorities expected to be responsible for people who were shielding in terms of delivering services?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: At this time I don't think it was entirely clear. I think the principle was understood, but there'd been very little discussion about the detail, and I think hence there was an assumption of what the local authority role would be, but there was certainly concern -- about every aspect of it, I think.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Is that something that was clarified?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: It would have been clarified as things progressed. It -- if you were to go back to the first page of the account of the meeting, the education section, where it refers to there the WLGA messages to Welsh Government are to allow local authorities to implement whatever plans could be put in place, and in a sense what we were saying was: in this instance, in order to get actions delivered as effectively as possible, sometimes it would be easier to describe rather than prescribe, to describe what authorities were able to deliver and the timescales available rather than being prescriptive in advance and then struggling to meet the prescription.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Is your evidence that it was the latter that the Welsh Government were trying to achieve?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can we finally move to page 3 of this document, and we can see that the last bullet point here provides almost a summary of this meeting:

"Concerns about [Welsh Government's] emergency planning approach and co-ordination -- lack of engagement with LAs, poor communication, delay in approaches following UK Government announcements ... [Document read] ... guidance or direction, planning and implementing already.

"WLGA already raising concerns with DGs following leaders' meeting."

Now, the reference to DG, is that director generals?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we can then move on to INQ000089875, please.

On 21 March 2022 you sent an email to the permanent secretary of Wales and the director generals, and I would like to go through this email in some detail with you, please.

Firstly, the matters that we've just discussed, are those the types of things that prompted you to write this email?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: They would have been, yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we can look at your email on page 2, please, the first bullet point:

"As the crisis escalates, leaders and chief executives are concerned that collectively we need to communicate more effectively, more efficiently and with greater precision."

Are you able then to please explain why you were seeking more effective, more efficient and greater precision in terms of communications?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Because we felt collectively that it was absent. We understood the strategic aim, if you like, in many instances, but it was the operational detail that needed to be clarified from a local authority perspective.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we can then look at your second bullet point, please --

**Lady Hallett**: So is the communication between the Welsh Government and you? It wasn't communication with the public, it was communication with --

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Oh, yeah. Yes, definitely yes. Sorry, yeah.

**Ms Paisley**: Thank you, my Lady.

The second bullet point, then:

"It is also felt that earlier engagement with Councils and greater trust between senior officials would speed up responses, lead to better delivery and potentially head-off some of the difficulty encountered in recent days."

So breaking that point down, firstly you make reference to desiring earlier engagement and in the third bullet point of this email you say:

"I don't believe that that is happening at the moment."

So there was a criticism that things were just happening too slowly at this point; would that be fair?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Looking back now, when do you think engagement should properly have ramped up with local government?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Do you mean a specific date or ...?

**Counsel Inquiry**: A time -- was there a turning point for you perhaps?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I think if I can turn it another way, I think the engagement should have taken place as early as possible. As soon as there was a strategic direction was taken or assumed, then local authorities should have been engaged. So if it was the issue of school closure, then local authorities should have been engaged immediately in terms of how to deliver school closures and the hubs and the provision for free school meals for vulnerable learners, for key workers and so on.

Local government delivers over 700 services, 24 hours every day, everybody in this room today has been using local government services. Whatever the circumstances, authorities understand how to deliver services, and that understanding can inform policymaking, and the sooner, I think, authorities would have been involved in this instance, then that would have saved time and would have resulted in more effective policymaking.

**Lady Hallett**: Can I just interrupt, I'm sorry, Ms Paisley.

You say that they should have been engaged as soon as the strategic -- one of those words I can't say -- direction had been taken. But arguably shouldn't they have been involved before?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I agree, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Because you're the one who's going to have to deliver it?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I agree, my Lady. I think we should have been part of the strategic decision-making. In effect that the experience of delivering services should have informed the strategic thinking and decision-making.

**Ms Paisley**: I just want to ask you about a specific comment that you make, which is about having greater trust between senior officials. Did you feel that there wasn't trust?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I ... well, at the time I think that the handling of a crisis like this depends on trust and confidence, and that all tiers of government at a time of crisis should show trust and confidence in each other. And I think there was a feeling within local government that that wasn't evident at all times in this instance.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So was there a feeling that perhaps local government was being kept in the dark about conversations?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I think there was a feeling that information could have been shared more fully earlier, that available data, scenario planning and other aspects that informed thinking and strategic policy should have been shared with local authorities.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can we then, please, move on to the response that you received to this from Tracey Burke, the director general for Education and Public Services. And her response, and I'm looking at the last part of her response:

"I do hope though that you have found our engagement with the WLGA over the weekend addresses some of your concerns -- I know Steve Davies been engaging with you on a number of issues over the weekend and that WLGA have been actively engaged in the work on 'shielded' people where we have kept in close contact with WLGA in the development of the letter and guidance that accompanies it. I know how closely and at pace you have been working with WCVA too. I think Reg too has been in touch today on other urgent developments over the weekend."

And Reg presumably is Reg Kilpatrick; is that right?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Did things improve, as this email suggests, from your perspective?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I don't actually recall the conversation on the weekend in question here, although I don't doubt that they happened, because we were in regular, constant contact with Welsh Government colleagues through different channels.

I think the point we're trying to make is the difference, I suppose, between consultation and engaging and information sharing, and what I'm trying to say here is that local government needs to be engaged at a point when it's possible to influence and shape policy rather than being informed when policy has been agreed and is -- and is being implemented, and that local government is then being informed or engaged with in terms of delivery rather than the co-construction and the co-production of the policy.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The Inquiry heard evidence earlier this week from Shan Morgan, and she was asked: were structures and processes put in place to ensure early and effective engagement with local government? We know at this point she was the permanent secretary to the Welsh Government.

Her reply in respect of her own engagement was that:

"I would say honestly that I could have done more. I think it would probably have been a very good idea had I invited the chief exec of the WLGA to become a member of ExCovid, or at least come from time to time when there was an area of particular interest. I think I could have done more to establish that level of regular contact, and in retrospect I think I should have established myself a pattern of regular one-to-ones with both the CEO of WLGA and of SOLACE ..."

Would you have any comments upon that reflection?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Well, I agree with it, I saw the -- I listened to Shan Morgan making the comments earlier in the week and I agree, I think, that had she done that at the time it would have been very useful, and it probably would have addressed some of the concerns that I expressed in the email.

To be honest, I did feel reassured as well, because there is -- it reflects a sense of learning, and -- in terms of this process, my Lady, I think that the recognition on her part that in hindsight she should have done things differently means maybe that that, you know, is something that can be taken on board for future reference.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can I then please move on to discuss any role played by the WLGA in the non-pharmaceutical interventions that were imposed in Wales, and in your statement you talk about the early stages of the pandemic, and you say:

"... consultative fora or structures had not been established and consultation was ad hoc via emails, telephone conversations or urgently convened meetings ... there was often limited opportunity or time to provide full views or canvass wider views during the earlier stages of the pandemic."

Specifically when you refer to ad hoc emails or telephone calls, can you remember who was calling, who was writing emails, who was asking for your views?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: It would have -- well, it would have been some of the people that have already been mentioned, Reg Kilpatrick, Steve Davies. We -- as an association, we have a very broad interface with the Welsh Government, so there would have been -- as an association, we try and encourage as much dialogue as possible between elected members. We're a member-led organisation. I would have anticipated that there would have been informal calls between leaders and Welsh Government ministers. There would have been calls, email between myself and other senior officials within the Welsh Government, but also at a service level as well, within education, within social services, in transport, economy and finance as well, so there would have been a very broad interface. We also engaged with the special advisers as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we can then look at some of the established structures that began to develop, and the first is that the Inquiry understands the WLGA leader was invited to attend the Welsh Government's core Covid-19 group. Was that a standing invitation each week?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I don't think that it was a standing invitation, but I think it happened on a regular basis.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And the Inquiry also understands that the WLGA itself convened regular leaders' meetings, and on 20 March the Minister for Housing and Local Government attended, 27 March the Minister for Health and Social Services also attended, and you say that from 1 April Welsh ministers began to regularly attend. Is that right?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yes, as an association we took a conscious effort that we would do everything that we could to improve the engagement between local government and the Welsh Government and, as I mentioned earlier, to act as the interface. And I think it's fair to say that ministers were very receptive to this approach.

At that time we were convening meetings of local authority leaders on an almost daily basis. As the technology changed from teleconferencing to Teams and Zoom, the quality of those meetings improved. But at a very early stage we started inviting ministers to attend those meetings as well. They were very receptive.

And again, it goes back to one of the principles that I mentioned earlier, that we thought at the time of crisis it was important to be politically led and to get elected members, politicians, ministers and leaders speaking directly and freely to each other without going through the filter of officers and public bureaucracy.

**Counsel Inquiry**: To what extent were those meetings that we've just discussed used to talk about non-pharmaceutical interventions and to seek the WLGA's views?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Well, they would have been opportunities and they would have been useful for that purpose, but what would also have happened is that the leaders themselves would have used the opportunity to raise their concerns.

All 2022 leaders represent individual wards, they're rooted in their communities, they live in their communities and represent -- they reflect the views of the people they serve. So I've no doubt that they would have been putting those concerns to ministers at those meetings.

**Lady Hallett**: Just before you go on, I'm sorry, there is a slight confusion in the [draft] transcript as well as in my notes, Dr Llewelyn, so can I just -- something you said -- just so the stenographer can find their own place -- at 14.11, and I wrote down, and it may have been me misheard, that the -- I wrote down two things that seemed to be contradictory, that ministers were keen to engage, but then you said, according to my note, when you issued invitations to attend the meetings they were not very receptive. So basically have we missed a "not" or have we included a "not" that we shouldn't have done?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: You've included a "not". Ministers were very receptive and I recall were always ready to join those meetings if invited.

**Lady Hallett**: Right, thank you, glad we cleared that up.

**Ms Paisley**: Thank you, my Lady.

It's right that those meetings became regularised to align with the 21-day review process. Was that something that was beneficial, to align with that process?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: It wasn't the intention and I think the -- I -- I think the meetings took place more regularly than the 21-day review process. There were meetings which aligned to the 21-day review process, which were useful, but our meetings, I think, took place more frequently and were more focused on particular issues.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can we please look at the WLGA's submission to the permanent secretary's Covid stocktake in October 2020.

INQ000089872.

This is written by Daniel Hurford of the WLGA, but hopefully you might be able to speak to it as well.

If we can look at the second paragraph:

"The approach to engagement from officials has evolved throughout COVID-19: inevitably the pace and urgency of the response phase was challenging for the Welsh Government and all in public services and this continued into the three weekly review of the initial lockdown. The open and effective political dialogue has not always been replicated at an official level, and despite several examples of excellent co-construction of timetabling and guidance between officials, co-production and information sharing has been inconsistent and it proved very challenging for local authorities to plan for the operational implementation of announcements (particular[ly] those affecting council services) with limited notice during the 21-day review period. There has been significant improvement in recent months in terms of dialogue and planning for local lockdowns but some instances where clarity and information sharing should have been quicker."

We will come on to a number of those issues, but generally speaking, do you think there was a missed opportunity by the Welsh Government to use those meetings to talk about NPIs in more detail with local government?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I think that the -- I think that the email there is saying that the dialogue at a political level was very effective and very open, but that when it came to the more operational detail and a delivery focus, that discussions with officials were less open and inclusive, and that the progress that was made at a political level wasn't always reflected. It varied according to service area. In some service areas the communication was very close and very effective. In others, it wasn't, that wasn't there a consistency. At the headline level, as it were, I think that generally there was considerable consensus.

And on reflection, I can remember at the time speaking to other parts of the -- other local government organisations in other parts of the United Kingdom, they were envious of the political engagement that took place within Wales and felt that there was a better dialogue within Wales and that local authority leaders had better access to ministers in Wales than in other parts of the country.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You say in your statement that in general the WLGA and the local authorities were supportive of the Welsh Government's approach and the NPIs. So would the problem, in your view, be that they could have just been brought in sooner into the discussion, perhaps, about implementation that they were expected to undertake?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I think they should have been brought into the discussion about implementation much earlier. The truth is that there were a range of views within local government as well.

One of the things we argue as an association is that it's -- that the strategy should be set nationally by central government but then local authorities should interpret that and deliver according to local circumstances. Where local circumstances differed, there would have been different views, but also a recognition that a single national coherent message in these circumstances was important as well. So I think that that's reflected in the discussion of the October firebreak.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just about to move on to the firebreak, and it's right that there were some differences of opinion between local authorities and in fact Councillor Andrew Morgan was asked to collate and co-ordinate local authority views. We don't need to bring it up, but the document is INQ000089864.

Was that something the Welsh Government asked to be produced for them?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I think we were asked to reflect the local government view, and it's something we would have routinely done, we would have consulted all 2022 to get a sense of what their view was.

As has been mentioned already, we've always taken the view that if local government speaks as one, with one voice, then it's more powerful than having a disparate set of voices.

So in this instance, in terms of the firebreak, there were differing views, a range of factors would have been taken into account, there would have been differences between east and west and between urban and rural authorities, but we did come to a consensus view. I think the collective view was it was more important to get a unanimous view and a single message than to have differing responses in each authority.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We don't need to display it again, but returning to the WLGA's submission to the Covid stocktake, it's noted that the level of dialogue in particular around the firebreak in the past week, where ministers engaged with leaders and chief executives through several meetings to help inform and prepare for decisions affecting their areas or services, had been a model of central/local relations; is that fair?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah. The point we're making there is that in this -- in that instance it was a consultation at a point when there was a chance of influencing the decision.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of existing structures that were in place going into the pandemic, to what extent were existing partnership structures used and did local authorities find those forums to be helpful?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Are you referring to the partnership council and the --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: -- arrangements that sit underneath that?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, please.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: They were -- the partnership council is something that exists under the Government of Wales Act and it defines the relationship between local government and central government in Wales. It is unique to Wales. And there are a range of subcommittees that sit underneath the partnership council. The finance subgroup through which the local government finance settlement is negotiated is one of those.

During Covid, the -- when the partnership council met, all 2022 leaders attended along with a range of other -- a range of Welsh Government ministers. Those arrangements worked effectively, but other arrangements were put in place as well to facilitate the dialogue between ministers and leaders, because, certainly on the local government side, it was felt that more regular dialogue was needed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Now, it's right that you submitted a second witness statement to this Inquiry, and I just want to ask you about a comment you make in general about the lessons learned exercises undertaken, and you say:

"It would be easy for the Inquiry to get the wrong impression about these exercises."

And you say the problem is that:

"... this does not fully reflect the WLGA's view of what happened; indeed, these Welsh Government reviews have in substance, if not exclusively, been undertaken within Welsh Government itself and have not involved key partners including local government."

My question is whether, in your view, there is a better way to conduct lessons learned on behalf of central government?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yes, I think there is. I think that all -- a wider range of partners, wider range of views should contribute to the learning lessons review. I think there are some things that we've discussed today which recognise that things could be improved. And I think we would have like -- we would have both liked and expected to have been more involved in that work than we have been.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can I change topic then and move on to the legislation and regulations and the role played by local authorities. And in respect of this in your statement you say consultation and engagement between Welsh Government officials and local government professionals was inconsistent on consultation, on finalised drafts, was often late, rather than co-produced from an earlier spoken.

Now, was this a problem throughout the course of the pandemic or can you pinpoint a specific time period?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I think it was a problem throughout, and as I've tried to explain, I think it varied according to service area and it improved during the course of the pandemic, but the underlying principle was a source of ongoing concern for us.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can we perhaps pinpoint a specific date: on 5 August 2020 there was an enforcement meeting with the First Minister, and this was in the context of businesses such as cafés, restaurants and clubs re-opening outdoors, and planned to open indoors. The Inquiry understands the First Minister asked for confirmation as to whether existing legislative powers would permit local authorities to act if issues were identified with premises not complying with the regulations.

If we can have on screen, please, INQ000228421, which was a briefing note for that meeting. Do you recognise this document?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do you know who produced it?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I can't recall, does it ...

**Counsel Inquiry**: Was it on the part of the WLGA?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Oh, sorry, yeah, I think it was, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we can please look at the bottom of page 2, into page 3, and it says:

"It cannot be over emphasised that our officers have a depth and knowledge, and we willingly offer this in the spirit of coproduction.

"Unfortunately, during the pandemic this resource has been overlooked in the planning, preparation and drafting of legislation. As a result, significant Public Protection resource across Wales has been ploughed into deciphering and interpreting regulations, instead of being put to better use, on the front line of providing advice and guidance to businesses and the public."

Does this then suggest that even the finalised regulations that were published were not always easy to understand?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yes, it does. This is -- I think the note is relatively clear, this is a complex area. There was experience and capacity with -- within local government, and had it been used at an earlier point then it would have led to better regulations and better guidance and would have probably saved time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The Inquiry understands from your statement that an officer was actually seconded to the Welsh Government in May 2020 to provide an operational and enforcement perspective. Is that something that proved to be beneficial?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: It did. It's the scale and capacity, I think, more of those kinds of secondments would have been very useful, I think.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'd like to then move on, please, to local lockdowns and restrictions. Generally speaking, to what extent were local authorities and the WLGA consulted by the Welsh Government in respect of decisions to impose local restrictions?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Do you -- are you talking about any specific time period?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. This would be just before heading into the firebreak, around the August/September period, when we started to see restrictions in Caerphilly.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Ah, right, yeah. I think as the year progressed, then the engagement improved, engagement with -- between elected members improved, and one of our concerns with -- within the WLGA and within local government was the way -- I think I mentioned earlier -- the data was shared with us, and the available evidence and the most up-to-date evidence was shared. And as local lockdowns and other arrangements of the October firebreak were discussed, increasingly, relevant evidence was shared with local authorities as well so that leaders could be part of an informed decision-making process.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm not going to go to the document in the interests of time, but there was a lessons learned document created about experiences of local --

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- lockdowns, and that's INQ000089884, and one point made is that clarity and consistency is needed around the implementation of local lockdowns and restrictions.

It says "Process -- summary and clarity of who takes what decision/when? What is/should be the role of leaders in process?"

Were those issues that were addressed by the Welsh Government, and did they improve?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: They certainly improved. I'd have to look in more detail at the extent to which they were fully addressed. My sense is that they weren't. But again, I think they're issues -- and I think that paper, it talks about -- I think it goes on to talk about contact tracing as well, and I'd expect that review to have fed into any learning lessons exercise.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I think we just briefly touched upon mention of data, and staying with this document under the heading "Data" it says:

"There has been an issue around the consistency and sharing of data -- chief executives and leaders have not had consistent access to the most recent 7-day figures on cases and testing used by Welsh Government and, until reported in the media, several were not aware their authority areas were in the 'amber' category."

What kinds of problems did that cause?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: There would have been a range of problems. This -- it's a point that I think I highlighted, it was a concern from the outset that -- it's the trust and confidence issue of information being shared as early and in as timely a way as possible.

And that information would have had an impact on all the services provided by local authorities and the considerations and the decisions that they would have made, and the way they would have fed into discussions with the Welsh Government as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can we then discuss, please, the care sector, and this will be explored in more detail in a later module, but in terms of delivery of care in Wales, what is the responsibility of local authorities in respect of care?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: They're set out in the Social Services and Well-being Act, and the local authorities have responsibility for those people who need care and who need support, also responsibilities for the people who provide care and support for them as well.

In addition, there's a wider responsibility for the delivery of social services as well and there's a safeguarding responsibility for children, young people and adults.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we can go back to where we began, in March 2020, please, it's right that the WLGA issued a joint statement with ADSS Cymru, and whilst these will be matters for later modules, can we have that statement, please, INQ000082951, and the statement says:

"Social care staff are undertaking a critical role at this time, like others in the health and care sector. They are keeping ... people and children and young people safe, and providing a range of care and support to others, and I would like to thank them for the work that they have done and will be doing. We need to ensure that they are safe and well enough to work, which means they need to be able to protect themselves with personal protective equipment ... as appropriate. We are calling for an extension of the testing regime as soon as possible to include social care staff so that people who are well enough to work can do so."

Can you outline, please, what led to this.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I think there was a general sense that the needs of social care staff as a whole weren't being taken into account, that the -- you've already heard in some of the evidence sessions this week about testing arrangements and the provision of PPE, I think there was a sense within the workforce that they were being neglected and weren't taken into consideration and account in the same way as other service areas.

And I think it was a feeling both within the workforce but within wider local government as well, that they weren't appreciated as fully as they should have done, that there was an issue of parity of esteem with other healthcare workers. I think everybody knows the rewards in this sector are very modest, and throughout the pandemic I think the social care workforce performed valiantly, brilliantly, incredibly well, above and beyond anything that could have been expected of them, and for a brief period there was a sense that they were appreciated in the same way as their colleagues within the NHS, but there was also the underlying feeling that their needs, both in terms of testing and PPE in particular, weren't being taken -- weren't considered in the same way as other service areas.

**Ms Paisley**: Thank you. I don't have any further questions for you.

My Lady, I understand there are some Rule 10s, and can I apologise for my mispronunciation earlier.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Ms Heaven.

Questions From Ms Heaven

**Ms Heaven**: Good afternoon, Mr Llewelyn.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Good afternoon.

**Ms Heaven**: I represent the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru.

Just a very short question, from paragraph 53 of your witness statement. If we can bring it up, just to assist you, but I will read it to you as well. It's INQ000410950, so it's paragraph 53. Okay?

Here you state that:

"In the view of the [Welsh Local Government Association] the key lesson learnt should be that we need collective and inclusive planning, led by Welsh Government, with a whole-systems approach engaging all partners who have a role to play. Local government is concerned that this learning is being lost, and that we might revert to the situation of inadequate planning and readiness for the next national emergency of the future which was explored in Module 1."

So my first question is this: how do you envisage the whole-system approach looking?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Can you bear with me a moment? It's only just appeared on the screen.

**Ms Heaven**: Okay. Paragraph 53.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Yeah.

**Ms Heaven**: Sorry.

*(Pause)*

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Okay. The -- in our evidence submission to Module 1, and in the supplementary evidence session -- submission to Module 2B, I think we list a number of recommendations as far as going forward and learning lessons, so I'd stand by all of those recommendations. It's a particular problem within emergency planning, the idea of inherited memory, institutional memory, and as there are staff changes, officers move on, it's lost. So it's more important than in many service areas to record that institutional memory, as it were.

As I've mentioned earlier, I would have expected any reflective process of looking at the lessons that were learned from the Covid period to include as many partners as possible. I certainly think that local government should have been included, but other sectors as well, the voluntary sector, and all those who were part of the response phase, I'd expect them to be included in the process as well.

**Ms Heaven**: Okay. Next question, then, please. Do you consider there is an appetite within the Welsh Government to implement the whole-system approach you describe, and if not, what do you consider to be the resistance?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: It isn't, it isn't evident that that appetite is there at the moment. I can't -- I can't really comment on where the resistance is. We have -- since the pandemic we have written to ministers, expressed concern about the capacity within some of the enforcement services, with the environmental health and within Trading Standards, also with -- within emergency planning as well.

I think it's worth bearing in mind that at the start of the pandemic, local government had gone through ten years of austerity. According to ONS figures, the workforce had been cut by 37,000 staff, the budget had been cut in real terms by about £900,000. Inevitably that has an impact on capacity. Some of those areas that were cut were environmental health, Trading Standards and would have been emergency planning.

I think the Covid experience points in the direction of not making similar cuts in those areas going forward. So I'd expect that to be part of the discussion.

**Ms Heaven**: Okay, thank you very much. Those are my questions.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Heaven.

Ms Foubister.

Questions From Ms Foubister

**Ms Foubister**: Good afternoon, Mr Llewelyn, I represent John's Campaign and Care Rights UK.

You say in your witness statement, and I don't think we need to put it up, at paragraph 24 that local authorities were uniquely well placed to be the first port of call for the most vulnerable people. Why do you say that?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: For a variety of reasons. Chief among them is the fact that elected members, councillors, live within the communities that they represent. They have a personal relationship with their ward members, they have a face-to-face relationship, in the way that other tiers of government don't always have. Similarly, officers throughout local government invariably live within their authorities as well and have a close understanding and relationship with the communities and the individuals they represent.

**Ms Foubister**: Do you think that during the pandemic local authorities were able to adequately support the most vulnerable people, including people in care?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I think they did their best. We've discussed the responsibilities of local authorities within the context of the Social Services and Well-being Act. The Coronavirus Act provided some easements in terms of how authorities discharge those responsibilities. To my knowledge, those easements were very rarely, if ever, used. Authorities had to do things in a different way because of the circumstances utilising remote working, I'm also conscious that there was a greater emphasis on using unpaid carers, of using friends and relatives, but in many instances because that was the option that was chosen or was deemed to be more appropriate. So I think authorities faced the challenge of doing things differently. They also had the challenge of the impact of Covid on their own workforce, some of them were shielded, many of them were vulnerable as well, but I think they discharged their responsibilities and -- but that they did do things differently.

**Ms Foubister**: You also refer in your witness statement to concerns raised by the WLGA about care home discharges. What concerns were raised?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: It was -- it was specifically the issue of testing before people were discharged from hospital to care homes. And I'm conscious today that there may be people here who suffered bereavement as a consequence, and I do express my deepest sympathies, and it was something that was discussed on a regular basis in our meetings with ministers. It was raised as a deeply personal concern on the part of leaders. Many of them spoke passionately about people within their community, friends and families who had suffered as a consequence of the policy. Even, I think, the day before the Welsh Government changed the policy, the matter was raised by some of our leaders with ministers.

**Ms Foubister**: And do you recall when the concerns were first being raised by the WLGA?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I could -- I don't remember, but it will have been recorded in our documents, and I think it would have been in one of the early meetings. As soon as leaders would have been alert to the anxiety then they would have raised it.

**Ms Foubister**: And you say that the concerns were raised with ministers; what was the response?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: I think that the -- my recollection -- again, this will be recorded in the documentation, my immediate recollection is that the Welsh Government and ministers were following scientific advice.

**Ms Foubister**: Thank you.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

Dr Llewelyn, it's almost like déjà vu, in Module 1, planning and preparedness, I heard a fair bit about how local authorities weren't sufficiently involved in the planning, and given the whole concept of the civil contingencies system is to have local authorities and others whom you also represent, as first responders and the like, I just find it extraordinary that it seems to be a common theme around the UK, this isn't just Wales, that local authorities aren't sufficiently involved in something that they're going to have to deliver if the worst hits us.

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: Do you want me to respond?

**Lady Hallett**: Yeah -- have I got it right?

**Dr Chris Llewelyn**: No, yeah, I agree with your comments. And I think it didn't crop up in the discussion but I think the Civil Contingencies Act is outdated and is no longer fit for purpose and needs to be reviewed urgently. If you look at the history of emergency planning going back to the Second World War, the days of Dad's Army, the Civil Defence Act in 1948, they respond to the challenges at the time. It was -- during the Second World War it was the threat of invasion, after that it was the threat of nuclear attack and the Cold War.

When the Civil Contingencies Act came in it was because there was a perception that we would have major incidents, one-off events, floods, airline crashes, train crashes and so on. At the time nobody envisaged a global pandemic of the nature and scale of the Covid crisis. I think we need to look at it again, I don't think it is fit for purpose, it isn't appropriate for a crisis of the duration of Covid. And significantly as well, it doesn't give elected members at any level enough of an involvement in the process as an organisation which, as I mentioned earlier, promotes the primacy of politics, of elected members taking decisions and being held to account. The Civil Contingencies Act and those arrangements that sit underneath don't take that into account.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed. I think I might have stirred some passion there, towards the end.

Thank you very much for your help. I know it's the second time we imposed. I'm not sure whether we'll ask you again, but anyway, thank you for all your help so far.

**The Witness**: Thank you.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Paisley.

**Ms Paisley**: My Lady, please can I call Reg Kilpatrick.
