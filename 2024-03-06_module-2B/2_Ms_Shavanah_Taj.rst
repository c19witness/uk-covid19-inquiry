*MS SHAVANAH TAJ (affirmed).*

Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Lady Hallett**: I hope we haven't kept you waiting, Ms Taj.

**Ms Cowen**: Ms Taj, could you please state your full name.

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Shavanah Taj.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you for assisting the Inquiry, both in terms of providing your witness statement and for your attendance here today. Can I please remind you to keep your voice up and to speak slowly and clearly so our stenographer is able to take a record of your evidence.

Your witness statement prepared for this module may be found at INQ000273633. We can see that that statement is signed on 8 September of 2023. Is that statement true to the best of your knowledge and belief?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Ms Taj, you are the general secretary of the Wales Trades Union Congress. You explain in your witness statement that the Trades Union Congress brings together 5.5 million working people that make up its 48 member unions drawn from all parts of the UK.

You go on to note that the Wales TUC is part of the TUC, and that it represents 400,000 workers in Wales through its affiliated unions.

The Wales TUC has devolved responsibility within the TUC for matters which are within the powers of the Welsh Government and the Senedd, matters that are wholly specific to Wales, and developing policy on matters which impact substantially differently on Wales than elsewhere in the UK; is that right?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

In your witness statement, you provide a detailed summary of the general role of the Wales TUC, and the Inquiry will have regard to the matters that you there set out. But is the role of the Wales TUC perhaps best captured in your own words from your statement where you state that the purpose of the Wales TUC is to "improve the economic and social conditions of workers in Wales"?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You explain in your witness statement that throughout the pandemic the Wales TUC had frequent communications and liaison with the Welsh Government. You explain in your statement that the context for that communication was the approach in Wales to social partnership.

Can I please ask you to explain what's meant by the term "social partnership"?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: So social partnership is what we often refer to as the Welsh way of working, it's a long-standing tradition in terms of how the Welsh Government has always operated. The pandemic meant that a Shadow Social Partnership Council was then set up, and that meant that trade union representatives, the Wales TUC leading on behalf of our affiliates, with them there with us as well, employer organisations and the government, were able to be in the same space together, but the pandemic allowed us the opportunity then to expand that tripartite model and bring in others, including many of the commissioners too.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: You speak very quickly, Ms Taj. Sorry, it's a failing I have too. Try to slow down.

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Sorry, it's a Cardiff thing, I'll try and --

**Lady Hallett**: Don't worry.

**Ms Cowen**: You may have touched on this already, but can I just ask you to explain how the approach to social partnership that you have just set out affected the Wales TUC's engagement with the Welsh Government during the pandemic?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Yeah. So in some instances it's probably useful for me to reference some of the things that we were able to do that led to -- directly to decisions which improved conditions for workers during the pandemic. Examples of this can be specifically in relation to some of the tightening up of regulations, workplace regulations in early 2021, the improvement of the administration of the Welsh Government's isolation support payments, and other financial supports as well, and particularly important was the issues around communications with workers on PPE provision and also workplace guidance as well.

In Wales the -- some of the differences here specifically was that the Welsh Government made sure that in their Covid guidance that it was made clear that employers should be consulting with their trade unions when it came to workplace risk assessments.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you very much.

I'm now going to ask you some questions about the engagement that the Wales TUC had with the Welsh Government during the pandemic. I'm going to ask you to outline the specific mechanisms that were in place to facilitate communication between the Wales TUC and the Welsh Government.

If I may begin with the Workforce Partnership Council.

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Yep.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In your witness statement you cite the Workforce Partnership Council as a forum for social partnership. You describe the Workforce Partnership Council as a tripartite social partnership structure that included the trade unions, employers and the Welsh Government; is that correct?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You also explain in your witness statement that the remit of the Workforce Partnership Council was to cover the devolved public services in Wales.

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do you think membership of the Workforce Partnership Council facilitated the Wales TUC's engagement with the Welsh Government during the pandemic, and if so can you say how, please?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Yes, absolutely.

So in terms of the Workforce Partnership Council, there are also a number of different groups that sit beneath it. So we have a health sector forum, we have -- we then established a social care forum as well, because, again, as the pandemic progressed we knew that there were big issues in that area, there's an education forum, but there were some gaps.

So some of the gaps that existed, particularly as things progressed, were in relation to hospitality and retail, and some of the unions that organised workers in those areas, including unions such as Equity, which represents a lot of the creative sector workers, were, we made sure that they equally had a voice and a direct channel into the Welsh Government.

And so the sort of sectoral engagement ended up expanding, and led to some, you know, good decisions being taken. So, for example, there one of the differences here in Wales was the creative sector unions were then able to access a special fund that was set up specifically for them, and individuals, workers sometimes who could kind of fall between the cracks, for example, people such as taxi drivers, we were able to ensure that they also had a voice when decisions were being taken around hospitality. So, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Before I go any further, and I'm sorry to come back to this, I am going to have to ask you to slow down a little bit. I know it's very difficult, but if you can please just try to do your best in that regard, thank you.

I'm now going to ask you about the Shadow Social Partnership Council. In your witness statement, you describe that the first iteration of this council was established in 2019, and that this council served to bring together Welsh ministers, employers and trade union representatives.

The Inquiry understands that membership of the Shadow Social Partnership Council was extended during the pandemic and the First Minister convened fortnightly meetings of the Shadow Social Partnership Council. Is that correct?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In your statement, you say that meetings of the SSPC typically took the form of an update from the First Minister regarding the Covid-19 situation, and then there would be two further updates which were usually from other ministers or the Chief Medical Officer regarding the Welsh Government's response to the pandemic.

You state that the council would typically meet after Cabinet had taken decisions, and this provided an opportunity to advise on how decisions would be implemented.

If it's right that the Shadow Social Partnership Council would typically meet after Cabinet had taken decisions, does that mean that the work of that council didn't actually influence decisions or become involved in decisions?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: The opportunity that we had was whilst those Cabinet meetings had already been taken, those meetings had taken place, the discussions that we would be having through the Shadow Social Partnership Council would take place before any public announcements were being made. And so there was an opportunity then for us to be able to influence some of the messaging, for example, or also to point out where there might be some gaps, particularly around some of the Covid guidance, some of the changes that might be coming up, and the need to make sure that every worker was able to access that guidance in a way that was understandable for that particular sector or for that particular worker.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, thank you.

I'm now going to ask you about the regular briefings that the Wales TUC provided to the Welsh Government.

You explain in your witness statement that early in the pandemic an arrangement was agreed for the TUC to provide regular briefing documents summarising for the Welsh Government the key and current issues being raised by the range of unions.

The Inquiry will have regard to the examples of issues raised by the Wales TUC in these regular briefings which are set out at paragraph 31 of your witness statement.

But can I ask you, do you consider that these briefings were an effective means to communicate the issues that were being raised by your members to the Welsh Government?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: I would say yes. So some of the things that we did do through some of those arrangements was, in real time, raise matters that were being brought to our attention. So from our perspective, you know, we were very clear as the Wales TUC that not -- our responsibility wasn't just to people who were members of a union but was to also make sure that all workers, regardless of whether or not they were in a union or not, were being protected.

So we, for example, set up very quickly a Covid helpline through our website. People who weren't necessarily either directly impacted could feed in. We had examples of where one man contacted us in relation to his wife who was a mental health nurse, and she was in a situation working in a ward where PPE hadn't been provided because the assumption was that everything -- it wasn't necessary at that stage. There wasn't enough understanding. We were able -- and she ended up in an altercation with a patient who ended up having Covid. He was -- she had messaged her husband, her husband then went on to our website, fed this in, and we were able to pass on that information in real time to the minister through the Welsh Government advisers, and through some of the Welsh Government staff, and quite quickly that matter was then dealt with, and the union representative also contacted on site as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I'm now going to ask about the liaison that the Wales TUC had with the Welsh Government in the early period of the pandemic.

You set out in your witness statement that the first significant liaison the Wales TUC had with the Welsh Government was on 12 March 2020, when the minister for health and social care and the Minister for Housing and Local Government held a conference call with the Wales TUC.

In your view, did this engagement take place sufficiently early?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: I think it took place as quickly as it could do at that stage. Of course, you know, when you look back, you think: was Wales actually prepared? Could things have been different? I think, yes, absolutely, things could have been different, but I think some of the difficulties perhaps are around the fact that the Welsh Government, you know, don't have, even now, a direct responsibility for employment rights, they don't have direct responsibility for enforcement, so --

**Lady Hallett**: Could we avoid any trespassing into what might be thought to be constitutional political matters, please, Ms Taj.

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Okay.

**Lady Hallett**: I have a number of terms of reference but they don't go that far.

**Ms Cowen**: I think, Ms Taj, it may be fair to say, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the question was: did this engagement take place sufficiently early, and I think you said that it perhaps took place as soon as it could have done, but it could always have been earlier --

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- should other things have been in place?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can I ask, please, that we bring up document -- I'm so sorry, I can see that it's been anticipated.

Here we have a letter that was sent by you to the First Minister on 14 March of 20. In this letter, we can see the immediate priorities for the Wales TUC in relation to the government's response to the pandemic at this stage.

At page 1 and going into page 2 of the letter, you set out four key concerns that the Wales TUC had at that point. Those concerns were namely the procurement of PPE, the dissemination of workplace safety guidance, the adequacy of sick pay and support for those who were suffering hardship.

To what extent do you think that the Welsh Government took the concerns you raise in this letter into consideration at this point in the pandemic?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: I think that they listened to us, we felt that we did have to keep pressing on some of these issues, particularly in relation to PPE. We -- I think there's a statement as well that we have submitted in our evidence alongside -- it was a public statement that we made with the BMA --

**Counsel Inquiry**: We'll come to that shortly, yes.

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: But it sort of is intertwined with that as well, which gives you a clear understanding that we felt that we had to keep pushing on some of these issues at the beginning.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Just in the interests of completeness, the document that we have brought up is INQ000068458. Thank you.

I'm now going to ask some questions in relation to the Wales TUC's concerns regarding PPE, but at the outset I wish to be clear that PPE will be considered as part of later modules of this Inquiry, so it's not necessary to give a detailed account of any arrangements at this stage.

You do note in your witness statement at paragraph 65 that:

"On 31 March 2020, the Workforce Partnership Council ... health trade unions issued a statement ..."

I'm actually going to ask that this be brought up.

That is INQ000068472.

At page 1 of this document, underneath the heading "PPE", we can see that the concerns raised were as follows: PPE failing to reach frontline workers; the clarity of the Welsh Government's frequently asked questions in relation to PPE; a lack of detail around what the amount of PPE purchased actually means; a gap in provision for those who are not able to access PPE under current guidance but who cannot practice social distancing due to the nature of their roles; and PPE provision in private social care settings."

In your view, were the concerns you raised at this stage of the pandemic in relation to PPE adequately addressed by the Welsh Government?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: This eventually led to the setting up of two different groups. Initially there was one in relation to PPE, trying to get a clearer understanding of where PPE was being distributed, who was actually able to access that. Some of the gaps that still remained really was around PPE -- fitting of PPE. That then moved on to testing as well. So that became a big issue for us. But I do think, as a result of us continuing to raise these issues and these matters being brought to the attention of ministers directly, it did mean that social care workers in particular who had raised concerns, those in private care homes and those who worked in third sector led care homes were then eventually able to get the necessary PPE that they needed at the time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I think this is the statement which you referred to just now, but at paragraph 68 of your witness statement, you referred to a joint statement on PPE in health and social care that was issued by the Wales TUC and the BMA Cymru on 12 April 2020.

Could we please bring this document up. It's INQ000180916, please.

At page 2 of this document, at the third paragraph, the joint statement states:

"While we have maintained regular dialogue with the Welsh Government over PPE ... [Document read] ... reassurance they deserve as they continue to serve the public."

Then the statement goes on to set out the particular areas about which information was sought.

You called for the Welsh Government to be transparent and to give an honest response on stock levels of PPE, where the stock is, where it's being stored, and when they will be delivered. You also call for independent inspectorates to check on supplies.

In your view, to what extent did the Welsh Government have regard to the concerns expressed in this statement?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: I think that they were genuinely concerned, which is why, again going back to the Shadow Social Partnership Council and the various different sectoral arrangements that exist where unions can continue to make the case, and through the channels of communications that we had, then eventually when the national Health and Safety Forum was set up, there was the opportunity to make improvements, and I think that the Welsh Government did do the right thing. Eventually we were able to have more information.

Some of the lack -- some of the areas where we did still struggle with particularly was around fit testing, some of those conversations were better in particular sectors, in others they were not so much. But the -- some of the big stories that we were -- the reason why it's referenced here around appropriate changing facilities, for example, one of the reasons why that was there was because, as health unions continued to hear at this stage from workers in those settings, that they weren't quite sure whether or not they could take their uniforms home to wash, for example.

We had a case where somebody had contacted our helpline and said "I have just finished my shift, I've taken my uniform off, I'm currently standing in the car park, I've put it in a carrier bag and put it in the boot, I'm now going to go home. I'm not sure if I can wash this at home and, if I do, what temperature should I be washing it at". So that's just an example of some of the things that were happening and why it was so important that we opened this detailed dialogue with the Welsh Government.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, thank you.

You explain in your witness statement that the advice given and representations made to the Welsh Government was predominantly based upon the feedback and information provided by the Wales TUC's affiliated unions and its members, and the Inquiry will have regard to what you set out in your witness statement regarding the proportion of Welsh employees that are either members of a union or have union representation in their workplace.

I'd now like to focus on two specific examples of work carried out by the Wales TUC in relation to evidence gathered about the experience of workers in Wales, and the two specific examples I would like to focus on are the experience of black, Asian and minority ethnic workers and the experience of disabled workers.

You explain in your witness statement that from the outset of the pandemic unions were reporting that black, Asian and minority ethnic workers were being discriminated against in a number of ways, for example not getting adequate access to PPE.

In your witness statement you refer to the BAME Covid-19 Advisory Group, which we have heard about already in this Module from Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna.

You state that you attended the majority of meetings of the BAME Covid-19 Advisory Group and that you assisted Professor Ogbonna in the drafting of the advisory group's report.

From the perspective of the Wales TUC, how effective do you think the meetings of the advisory group were?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: I think they were definitely effective because one of the things that then happened was there was a subgroup that was set up specifically to look at the development of individual risk assessments. They were initially developed in -- with healthcare workers in mind, but they were expanded upon. And we were also in a position, because we were looking at the disproportionate impact of Covid-19, again referring back to some of the information that we were picking up from affiliates at the time -- so, for example, there had been an outbreak in two food processing plants. There was a significant number of migrant workers. English was not their first language, Welsh was not their first language, and so they really struggled with Covid guidance. And had it not been for the unions in that space at the time, we would not have been able to, one, find out what exactly had happened, whether or not risk assessments had been conducted, but also some of the information, the intel that we picked up that then assisted this group, but also the Welsh Government more broadly, was the fact that some of these migrant workers were, you know, living in shared accommodation. So they would go to work together and then they were living in accommodation where, you know, transmission became quite difficult to manage.

We -- the reason why I think as well it was important for the Welsh Government to look at the socioeconomic factors was because at that time we were -- as from a Wales TUC perspective, any information that we were gathering, we always made sure that we took a public position, that our information was readily available to anybody.

You know, when you have somebody who looks like me in this position, there are going to be a number of people from those minoritised groups who will directly contact me and ask questions, and we were then able to point them in the direction of various different unions that could support them as well. And as you say, you've referenced the fact that we'd put out a call for evidence as well, particularly for BAME workers, that we fed in.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, thank you.

In your witness statement you also explain that the Wales TUC Equality Committee invited the Deputy Minister and Chief Whip Jane Hutt to two of its meetings, one on 21 April of 2020, and one on 5 May.

Can we please turn to the minutes of the first of those meetings, the meeting of 21 April.

That's INQ000068464.

So the context of this meeting is that prior to this meeting a paper produced by the Wales TUC Equality Committee regarding the equality impact of Covid-19 had been circulated. We don't need to bring that document up yet, but looking at these meetings, at page 2 of the minutes, at paragraph 10, the minutes record that the Deputy Minister and Chief Whip:

"... suggested that an assessment should be made in the near ... [Document read] ... during this crisis period."

As far as you are aware, was such an assessment as is intimated in those minutes ever made?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Well, in addition to the Covid-19 Advisory Group and the reporting to the disproportionate impact of Covid-19, what did happen was that Wales then developed a series of equality action plans, and there's lots of work that has gone on into that, particularly in relation to race, in terms of disability and LGBTQ+ matters as well, so some of the issues that we were raising in these meetings we have then seen action being taken.

I think it's important for me to also sort of say as far as the minister, Jane Hutt, herself is concerned, she was -- you know, she really was a consistent advocate on equality issues and she genuinely worked hard to make sure that any information that she was gathering, particularly through her engagement with the unions and the Wales TUC, that she was feeding that back up at a Cabinet level but also making sure that all departments understood our role, because -- and I can say that because on a regular basis we would hear from an official who would say "Jane has suggested that we talk to you on the following matters".

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Can we please bring up the report to which I earlier referred that was discussed in this meeting. That's a report prepared by the WTUC Equality Committee.

It's INQ000068460.

If I can ask, please, for page 6 going into page 7 to be brought up. There we will find ten issues that it's reported disabled people and carers were facing. These issues included how frightening DNRs (Do Not Resuscitate notices) had become for disabled people, that people with motor neurone disease had not been identified as being extremely vulnerable, and therefore were excluded from automatic inclusion onto the shielding list. There were examples cited of shielding letters being sent to the wrong address, disabled people struggling to receive reasonable adjustments or maintaining their reasonable adjustments due to workplaces being understaffed.

As far as you are aware, were these concerns acted upon by the Welsh Government?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: I think that the -- as far as the shielding letters are concerned, there was some confusion at the start of the pandemic and we raised these matters at the Shadow Social Partnership Council meetings and, in some cases, the sectoral meetings as well.

Employers in Wales and I think in parts of -- maybe some of the Welsh Government officials didn't necessarily understand the detail around the furlough scheme, for example, and the fact that people could request to be furloughed by their employer, even if they were classed at that point as a key worker.

But of course it was always the case that reasonable adjustments could have been made, should have been made and that's why the impact assessments and the individual risk assessments were important.

But we continued to engage on this issue, and when it came to disabled workers, of course, there were a number of jobs -- like, before the pandemic, we always heard from employers who just assumed, "Well, you know, we can't make reasonable adjustments because" -- essentially of somebody being able to work from home, yet actually, as things progressed, lots of workers, including disabled workers, were able to, you know, conduct their duties from home, and that was something that we really pushed for.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Okay.

**Lady Hallett**: Could I just interrupt here. I think the question was: did the Welsh Government act on it? I appreciate you've spoken about a number of meetings and engagement and representations you made, but was any action taken?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: I think that there was some action taken, I couldn't -- on every single point that we've identified here, I would probably need to go through that and provide you some -- with some further information after, if that's okay.

**Ms Cowen**: Yes, thank you.

You explain in your witness statement that a particular value of social partnership in the context of the pandemic was that the Wales TUC was well informed as to how in practice the various approaches adopted to NPIs were being implemented across a range of sectors. I'd like to briefly look at three specific NPIs: firstly, self-isolation and sick pay; secondly, lockdowns and local restrictions; and, thirdly, working from home.

In relation to self-isolation and sick pay, you're clear in your witness statement that the dominant feature of Wales TUC's concern was the extent to which workers were able to self-isolate without significant financial hardship accruing.

Could we, please, turn to document INQ000180894, please.

This is a letter sent by you on behalf of the Wales TUC to Julie Morgan, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services. In the third paragraph of page 1 and the second sentence of that, you state that:

"The fact that many social care staff, who are already low paid, continued to face a financial penalty for taking sickness absence is contributing to the spread of the virus, particularly within care homes, and we would welcome a similar policy commitment in Wales that extends to all social care workers, including agency workers."

Did you feel that this concern was addressed by Ms Morgan and the Welsh Government?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: So, on the -- when we wrote to -- first of all, of course, the GMB raised this issue, and when the GMB raised this issue it is important for me to also flag that the individual who wrote that letter had been a care worker for over a decade before she became an officer representing that workforce, so they were matters that were really close to her, she understood them very clearly, and so when they wrote to Julie Morgan calling for social care workers to receive sick pay, and then we later referred -- referenced the disincentive to comply with infection control measures, and the fact that the -- there had been -- we requested that the consequential from the infection control fund was introduced to a fund sick pay scheme for social care workers, as of late October we still didn't have clarity actually what the -- as to what the delay was.

So I think that the -- for both that scheme but also in relation to the wider -- the sick pay enhancement scheme for social care workers but also the wider self-isolation support scheme, we repeatedly requested data on its uptake, and we failed to get anything robust specifically in relation to the uptake of the social care sick pay scheme, and we are not quite sure why it took some time for that to be introduced. It could well be that there was a funding issue and there were decisions that the government needed to take at the time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

If I can now ask you briefly about local restrictions in Wales and I wish to focus on the circuit-breaker that was implemented in Wales in October of 2020.

Now, you're very clear in your witness statement that the Wales TUC supported the decision to implement to circuit-breaker as it was, in your words, the right call for public health. However, you go on to note that:

"The difficulty is that whilst Wales elected the Welsh Government to make decisions over public health ... [it was] the UK Government [that] was responsible for wage support."

Now, from the TUC's perspective, how problematic was this aspect of devolution regarding the implementation of the firebreak lockdown in October 2020?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Well --

**Lady Hallett**: Be careful here, please. I can't go into the devolution settlement, so if you can answer that question without trespassing too far, Ms Taj, please do, but it is a very tricky one.

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Well, from ...

**Ms Cowen**: I wonder if I might just ask the question a different way. Perhaps if I could ask, from the Wales TUC's perspective, how did funding affect the firebreak lockdown in October 2020?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: The fact that we were going to be going into a firebreak and workers who -- you know, particular sectors were set to be shut down, particularly hospitality and retail, for example, that had just about re-opened, and people -- some of the music venues had started to re-open, if the fact that they were going to be shut down and there was going to be no financial support, how could we ensure that people would comply with the regulations. And so the -- you know, it felt as if the UK Government didn't seem to care that it was putting Welsh Government in an impossible situation, forcing them to decide --

**Lady Hallett**: I think you're now trespassing.

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: Sorry.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Ms Cowen**: If I now may very briefly ask you about working from home, and specifically the development of regulations requiring working from home in December of 2021.

You state in your statement that on 17 December of 2021 the Welsh Government published changes to its work from home regulations, whereby workers in Wales could face fines of up to £60 for leaving a place where they are living for the purposes of work where it's reasonably practicable for the person to work from home.

The Inquiry will have regard to the statement that the Wales TUC issued on 21 December of 2021 where you set out your concern that the worker is not responsible for the place of work, that is the responsibility of the employer.

You also explain in your witness statement that on 22 December of 2021 the First Minister clarified that the focus of any enforcement activity in relation to the regulations pertaining to working from home would be on employers permitting and enabling home working.

Do you feel that the Welsh Government had therefore taken your views into consideration on this issue in the development of this regulation?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: This was ... this was quite a difficult one for -- from our perspective. On 20 December 2021 we'd had -- you know, we'd seen the news reports that the Welsh Government had introduced a working from home regulation. Our concern was that the focus was back on the individual worker rather than the employer.

I think that it felt -- we were quite clear that maybe there was a misunderstanding about the worker/employer relationship and where the power actually lies. If an employer was asking an employee to come into work knowing fully well that they could be ending up facing a fine, and that worker then wasn't doing as they were told, and that worker then was being threatened with potentially not having any more hours, for example -- because the assumption would be that -- you know, not everyone is on a permanent contract, there are lots of people in Wales, a significant number of people, who are on zero-hours contracts -- that somehow they would -- that they would be responsible.

I mean, look --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Ms Taj, I don't mean to interrupt you, and I apologise, I'm just mindful of the time.

Can I just ask, the question was about whether you felt the Welsh Government acknowledged, responded to the concerns that the Wales TUC had expressed on that point. Do you think they did?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: I think that they understood where we were coming from and there was a statement made eventually by the First Minister, making it quite clear that the focus here is on the employer, but there was definitely some confusion.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I'm now going to turn to my final topic, which is public health communications and public confidence. You explain in your statement and the Inquiry will have regard to this, that you consider a major concern to have been what you term an "information deficit" in Wales, where you say that only a relatively small proportion of the population were receiving news about the country, and you state that the news and information deficit was an important factor during the pandemic. You state that the information deficit "added to public confusion, especially when rules were different in Wales to those in England".

You explain in your witness statement that the Welsh Government lacked pre-existing channels with which to communicate their key messages with workers, and this meant that often there was insufficient relevant focus on how key communications supported people in dealing with workplace risks.

Could I just ask, what channels do you think ought to have been in place?

**Ms Shavanah Taj**: So there were the daily sort of press updates that were given, but the -- when it came to information, more often than not the information that people were receiving, the -- you know, they were on one hand watching Welsh news to see what the First Minister was saying and then on the other hand they were watching to see what the Prime Minister at the time, Boris Johnson, was saying. So there was definitely some confusion.

A lot of the media that people receive isn't necessarily Welsh media, and so national media would reference UK regulations, wouldn't necessarily differentiate with what was needed to be understood here in Wales, so I think that the -- that kind of news deficit definitely added to the confusion when, you know, English and Welsh rules ended up diverging.

**Ms Cowen**: Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Ms Taj.

My Lady, that concludes my questions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Cowen.

Thank you very much, Ms Taj. I'm sorry I had to stop you from trespassing. I'm sure you're a very strong advocate for your cause, but please be assured you're not the first person I've had to stop from trespassing into matters that are beyond my remit.

Thank you for your help.

**The Witness**: Thank you.
