3. Submissions on Behalf of Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Ms Mcdermott
====================================================================================================

**Ms McDermott**: Hello, good morning, my Lady. We're just in there, in the morning.

As you know, I am Marie-Claire McDermott and I represent the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, led by Brenda Campbell KC, Peter Wilcock KC, and instructed by PA Duffy Solicitors.

Now, in addition though those bereaved families who are present, there are a number of bereaved family members who are joining us online, particularly from Northern Ireland, and I would like to take the opportunity now to acknowledge their remote attendance.

As has become a familiar practice in this inquiry from the outset, I draw to your attention the joint submissions already filed and referred to with the Inquiry on behalf of the UK and Northern Ireland Bereaved Families for Justice, and on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice I would like to thank you for your careful consideration of these submissions and your deliberation of what flows from them. We very much appreciate it.

Now, I hope you will note from the outset that the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice and those who represent them continue to be committed to participating collaboratively with the Inquiry in order to best assist the Inquiry to meet its objectives.

Now, turning to the Module 4 points and issues under vaccine and therapeutics, the purpose of my submissions today are to highlight the key points to which I'd wish to draw your particular attention as you navigate the issues within this module. The first point being the timing of Module 4, that being Module 4 being heard before Module 3.

Now, it has already been highlighted by my learned friend Ms Stone as a matter of great concern, and whilst I have no intention of rehearsing submissions already made, it would however be remiss of me not to revisit this thorny issue in brief terms, in the hope that I impress upon you the anxiety that the order of the modules brings upon the Northern Ireland families that I represent.

To that, I note and am grateful to the submissions already made and heard this morning by Mr Wald, which has been very informative and very, very helpful.

So, the point I would like to make is that, as night follows day, so too should Module 3 follow Module 2 in the hearing sequence for the Inquiry. The Inquiry, having concluded Module 2, will have delved into the political response to the pandemic, should then immediately turn its mind to focus on the impact that the political decision-making has on the healthcare systems, that being the core for Module 3.

Notwithstanding the helpful explanation of the timing of Module 4 made by Mr Wald this morning, we would ask that you bear in mind the reasons for the concerns of our clients in respect of this issue.

My Lady, you have already heard some evidence about the dire state of the healthcare systems in Northern Ireland from Module 1, and you will recall the lamentations about the failures to implement the Bengoa report recommendations. You know all too well the statistics about decreasing funding and the increasing waiting lists and the continuing impact on the access to healthcare in Northern Ireland. No doubt more will bubble to surface through the length and breadth of Module 2 and Module 2C, however, until we reach Module 3 the Inquiry can never really feel the true texture of the impact of the pandemic on the health and care sectors and, significantly, its inability to withstand the full force of the pandemic in 2020 and the consequential need for even more critical reform in 2023 and 2024.

In short, it can wait no longer. With that in mind, I invite you, my Lady, to reconsider the order of the module hearings as per the natural sequencing.

Moving then to the second topic which I would wish to address before you this morning, my Lady, I'd like to draw your particular attention to a provincial issue, and that's the scope for Module 4. That is wide, but, on behalf of the formidable group whom I represent, I ask that our voices do not become lost and that you continue to hear and include the participation of the regional accent. By the time you reach Module 4 you will already have visited Northern Ireland in M2C and we look forward to that and welcoming you to Northern Ireland.

In M2C we will scrutinise the core decision-making in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, however, the limited timescale allocated to M2C, to put it bluntly, is punishing and is already brimming with issues such that there will be insufficient time allowed to examine the use of vaccines and therapeutics in Northern Ireland.

As such, the only opportunity to address vaccines and therapeutics through the lens of the Northern Ireland group will be in Module 4. Accordingly, I respectfully ask that ample allowance is made for the perspective of Northern Ireland to be meaningfully considered and, to that end, your Ladyship should hear from witnesses who can speak to the Northern Ireland viewpoint.

On this, I invite your Ladyship to consider amending the draft outline of the scope, making specific provision for a comparative across the jurisdictions, scrutinising any differences between them and what any differences may have meant to the relevant jurisdictions.

Our group instructs, as an immediate example of this, that the number of doses of a vaccine which were required to be considered fully vaccinated by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland as compared to England, Wales, differed. This one issue had corresponding ramifications for the rules on contact by family members in those in care homes in and around December 2021, as those who would have been considered fully vaccinated in England and Wales were not deemed fully vaccinated in Northern Ireland.

The impact on those whom I represent, it is critical. Sadly, for many of the Northern Ireland Covid bereaved groups, this was the last Christmas they would have spent with their loved love.

Finally, I would like to turn to the issue of witness evidence, the first-hand accounts of those whom I represent. I rehearse and reiterate the echoes of previous submissions at preliminary hearings regarding the importance of the Inquiry hearing witness evidence from those with lived experience of matters addressed in each module. There can be no room for doubt that the witness evidence from the Covid bereaved is surely as important to you as it is for them. You have already commented that some of the most insightful participants in the impact film came from Northern Ireland, and of course who can forget the extremely moving and poignant evidence of our own Brenda Doherty, who provided a powerful conclusion to the evidence at the end of Module 1.

Whilst reflecting that we continue to request the invitation to give oral testimony to the Inquiry, the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice

will continue to identify such a range of such evidence

that we feel should be heard, and we will work

tirelessly to assist the Inquiry in identifying

a proportionate number of witnesses who are able to

reflect the varied, lived-in experiences of our client

base.

My Lady, unless there's anything you wish me to

address you on or refer you to specifically, those are

the submissions on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid

Bereaved Families for Justice, and I would like to

thank you again for your continued consideration.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms McDermott, and

the point you make about comparative analysis, I was

thinking about that just yesterday, and I agree it's

something that needs careful consideration.

Thank you very much indeed.

**Ms McDermott**: Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Ms Shepherd, are you at the back? You are.

I'm going to move across so I can see you.
