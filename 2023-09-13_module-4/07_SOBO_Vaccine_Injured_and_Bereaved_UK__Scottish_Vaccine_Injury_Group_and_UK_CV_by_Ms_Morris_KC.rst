7. Submissions on Behalf of Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK, Scottish Vaccine Injury Group and UK CV by Ms Morris KC
=====================================================================================================================

**Ms Morris**: My Lady. I'm conscious of the time, my Lady, can I just indicate for your note and for the stenographer's benefit, I will be taking my allocated time of 20 minutes. I note it's 20 to 1. I'm happy to make a start and break over lunch, I'm entirely in the Inquiry's hands.

**Lady Hallett**: If you're going to be 20 minutes, I think we can complete you and then break.

**Ms Morris**: Thank you for that indication. I would be grateful for a lectern if one is available from the hearing staff. Thank you.

Thank you, my Lady. I alongside Mr Bradley and Mr Weaver, who sits beside me, and my instructing solicitor, Mr Wilcox, represent three groups of those who have suffered a Covid vaccine adverse reaction or bereavement. These groups are the UK CV Family, the Scottish Vaccine Injury Group, and the Vaccine Injured and Bereaved. All three groups have been granted core participant status.

With the time allocated to me, I will first introduce you to these groups.

Second, I'll set out why their voices are critical to this Inquiry's examination in Module 4.

Third, I'll amplify our submissions in respect of the provisional scope of Module 4.

My fourth topic will be disclosure to core participants and the instruction of experts.

My fifth will be the Listening Exercise.

My sixth and final topic will be the significant topic of how the Inquiry ensures the effective participation of those who have suffered a vaccine adverse reaction or bereavement in both the preliminary stages and in the oral hearings.

So first, my Lady, may I introduce the three groups, representatives of whom sit in court and many are following proceedings online.

The UK CV Family is the largest support and advocacy group in the UK for those who have lost a loved one or suffered a life-changing adverse reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine. They are run entirely by volunteers, all of whom are vaccine injured or bereaved themselves. They are focused on the needs of UK-based patients, providing help and support and advocacy, and actively raising awareness within the British healthcare system, the media and the government.

As of August this year, the UK CV Family has more than 1,200 members, and approximately 20 people join every week. Membership is about 75% female and 25% male, and ages range from 14 to 76-years old. The most prevalent age range is 45 to 54-years old. Membership is limited to those people who have had an adverse reaction from a vaccine. There are also two other groups specifically focusing on the needs of those bereaved by the Covid-19 vaccine or caring for those living with the ongoing effects of the adverse reaction. This group has a strict criteria for joining. Those simply curious about vaccines or seeking information for their own agenda are not permitted to join.

Vaccine Injured Bereaved UK, or VIBUK, is a group of individuals and families who have either been severely injured or bereaved as a direct and confirmed result of receiving a Covid-19 vaccine in the UK. They are campaigning for the government to reform the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme, because in our submission it is both inadequate and inefficient. They also run a support group offering support, guidance and raising awareness of vaccine injury and bereavement.

The primary causes of these injuries and deaths are: vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or VITT; vaccine induced vasculitis; stoke; cerebral venus sinus thrombosis; and Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Survivors are having to cope with the aftereffects of their injuries, including brain damage and physical disablement, whilst the bereaved are struggling to live without their partners, children or parents. All VIBUK members have a confirmation that their injuries were caused by the Covid-19 vaccine.

The Scottish Vaccine Injury Group is a rapidly growing community of Scottish individuals who have either experienced adverse reactions to or who have been bereaved by the Covid-19 vaccine. In a small number of instances, carers have joined the group on behalf of relatives who are too sick to participate. The group currently has over 200 members and has a core participant status in the Scottish Public Inquiry. All members of the group are screened rigorously to ensure that they are adversely impacted.

Collectively, my Lady, we estimate that these three groups, and allowing for some overlap, represent at least 1,350 Covid vaccine adversely impacted individuals. We have no way of knowing exactly the total numbers that have been adversely impacted but it should be assumed that there are others who have not found a support group yet.

May I now turn to why the voices of these groups are critical to your investigation within this Inquiry. We represent the families of those who have lost their loved ones due to an adverse vaccine reaction. Lisa Shaw, Stephen Ward, Dr Stephen Wright, Vicky Spit's partner Zion, Neal Miller and Lucy Tabererer lost their lives due to vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.

Neal Miller went into hospital on 7 April 2021 with chest pains. He had a heart attack due to a blood clot, but it was noted his heart was otherwise healthy. He was discharged after three days, even though he could not walk properly. The consultants did not connect the occurrence of a blood clot to the vaccine, despite a connection being widely reported in the media. Neal was a healthy 50-year old who played sport and looked after his health. His blood clot should have raised alarm bells. Two days later he collapsed and was diagnosed with numerous further blood clots. Whilst in hospital he became confused and had trouble talking. He underwent an MRI and plasma exchange and was again discharged from hospital. He was at home for only four days before he collapsed and passed away. His family feel that had the connection between the vaccine and his blood clots been made at the first admission, his survival chances would have been greater.

Kenneth Purnell lost his life due to vaccine induced vasculitis. The partner of Michael Cornwell died due to bilateral cerebral venous thrombosis.

Margaret Bailey lost her life from a suppressed immune system due to developing stage 4 lung cancer.

From the UK CV Family, Alexandra Kelly lost her mother, Anthea, a retired palliative care nurse, to pneumonitis caused by the Covid vaccine. Anthea died within four days of her vaccine, and at an inquest that took place over 18 months after her death, a pathologist confirmed that the vaccine had caused it.

Individuals within the three groups have developed a variety of conditions, including VITT and CVST, Guillain-Barré syndrome, mast cell activation syndrome, significant vision Impairment, rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, myocarditis, chronic fatigue syndrome, tinnitus, heart issues, chest pain, brain fog, weakness in their limbs, or have suffered pulmonary embolism or heart attacks. Some have had to undergo amputation.

This is not an exhaustive list, my Lady. Many of our clients have experienced delayed diagnosis, which has resulted in permanent damage.

And within each of these groups there are a number of bereaved families who were denied proper investigations into the deaths of their loved ones because those deaths occurred at home during a national lockdown.

My Lady, Covid vaccine reactions and bereavements have also had a wider impact on society as a whole. Medical professionals who have experienced an adverse reaction have been unable to work since the beginning of the vaccine roll-out as they were the first to be vaccinated.

Our clients can provide case studies of NHS staff who have experienced significant adverse reactions, and in some cases, death.

The Scottish Vaccine Injury Group, for example, have several medical professionals who have suffered life-altering reactions. These are specialist medical staff who selflessly put themselves on the frontline during the early months of the pandemic and were told, like everyone else, that the vaccines were safe and effective. Some were even told that if they didn't take the vaccine they wouldn't be allowed to return to work.

We represent one nurse, who wishes to remain anonymous, she doesn't want her work colleagues to know about her vaccine reaction because she isn't sure of the responses she will encounter. Two years ago, prior to her vaccine, she had a senior position working 12 hours on night shifts. She is a single parent and her family relies on her income. Four days after her second vaccine, she experienced PV bleeding for no apparent reason, and then three days later was diagnosed with bilateral large volume pulmonary embolism, with right heart strain. She has battled for two years and now she is managing one 9-hour shift per week in a different role entirely, but that one shift is still extremely challenging for her, due to ongoing symptoms. Her life has been turned upside-down and she has undergone significant trauma, yet cannot speak about the cause for fear of recrimination.

Another nurse, a specialist theatre nurse, has been diagnosed with vaccine-induced pulmonary fibrosis, a serious and lifelong lung disease that causes permanent lung scarring that progressively worsens over time. There is no cure, only temporary symptomatic relief. She was told she would lose her job if she didn't take the vaccine, so, despite her misgivings, she went ahead because she is a single mother of two children. Now those children are her carers.

My Lady, it's easy to reel off abstract facts and figures, but these are real people, facing insurmountable hardship, who felt coerced into taking a vaccine in the first place and now can't even mention their reactions to their colleagues.

In addition to their injury and bereavement, those we represent have also experienced a second trauma: a lack of medical knowledge and understanding about the risk and presentation of vaccine injury has left injured people undiagnosed and without treatment. Furthermore, the prevailing institutional mindset within medical bodies and the government has been fixated solely on acknowledging the benefits of the vaccine. This has led to those reporting vaccine injury to feel disbelieved, unheard and marginalised.

Censorship is a very real issue, my Lady for the vaccine injured and bereaved. Their support groups have been shut down by social media platforms and their experiences censored by the mainstream media. They have to speak in code online for fear of having their only source of support taken away from them. They face stigma and abuse for sharing their symptoms in the context of the Covid vaccine and even been branded as anti-vax for sharing very real and medically proven vaccine injuries.

Care must be taken in the Inquiry's own examination of the role of social media and ensure that the Inquiry itself doesn't fall into the trap of further disenfranchising those who've experienced vaccine injury.

To be clear, those we represent voluntarily participated in the Covid-19 vaccination programme when called upon. A significant number of them encountered adverse reactions following the first vaccine dose. Nonetheless, they were advised by their doctors to proceed with the second dose, their doctors not suspecting any vaccine-related connection.

My Lady, there is a particular significance to these Module 4 hearings taking place in the autumn. Those we represent are concerned that, given the reported return of Covid-19 variants and the discussion in government and the media of a winter vaccine roll-out, that their experiences will once again be censored and ignored as they don't fit with the government narrative around vaccines.

The Covid vaccine injured and bereaved have been marginalised in the past three years, struggling to have their voices and experiences heard, having gone from being fit and healthy people, leading full and active lives, to being disabled and dependent on benefits. They have suffered additional trauma due to the lack of medical, psychological and financial support available.

These are not people, my Lady, who are dealing with a sore arm or flu-like symptoms, these are people who have had a stroke, a heart attack or lost a limb, people whose bodies are full of clots, people who have had debilitating migraines almost every single day for up to three years, and people who now have allergic reactions to everything they consume, even water, and young women who had hoped to become mothers but whose periods have stopped completely. These are not the normal side effects anybody would reasonable expect from a pharmaceutical product. These are people who have lost their livelihoods, their friends and, in some cases, their families.

In addition, the vaccine injured and bereaved can't process their trauma because they're fighting every step of the way for recognition, validation, care and support. They can't express or record their experiences without being misunderstood, misrepresented or used for somebody else's agenda.

In August of last year the UK CV Family lost its first member to suicide and a survey of their members reported 73% have considered suicide. Both UK CV Family and Scottish Vaccine Impact Group regularly deal with suicidal members. All three groups are extremely concerned that in the absence of psychological support for those who are now dealing with a chronic as well as stigmatised illness, this will not be the last suicide within the injured community.

The treatment of the vaccine injured in this country has historically been a source of shame. Neglect and dissemination has been brought to the light through the Covid-19 vaccination roll-out and is not resulting in serious mistrust of British institutions, of the government and of healthcare systems. Trust is vital in the event of future health crises. In order to rebuild trust from the general public, the UK must urgently develop an effective and compassionate means of medically, practically, financially and emotionally supporting the vaccine injured.

My Lady, I will now move on to some focused submissions on the provisional scope of Module 4. The first point I would make, my Lady, is that those we represent are from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and therefore we press upon you, as others have, the need to analyse all the issues within the Module 4 scope from the perspective of the UK government and the devolved administrations.

Secondly, my Lady, you have indicated that as part of your provisional scope that the Inquiry will examine vaccine safety issues, and Mr Wald King's Counsel has stated this morning that this will form a significant part of the Inquiry's work. Our clients seek an examination into the public awareness of the safety profile approval process for the vaccine and steps that might have been overlooked due to the speed of the vaccine production, and distinctions between this vaccine production and others previously approved.

This is what Mr Wald termed the balance between speed and safety, and we're grateful for the acknowledgement this morning that this is an important topic that the Inquiry will consider.

Our clients also ask the Inquiry, as others have, to conduct a thorough investigation into the decision not to use alternative therapies to treat Covid-19, instead employing emergency regulations to roll out a new vaccine. We note the submissions made by other core participants urging the Inquiry to look carefully at therapeutics and not just vaccines.

My Lady, you have also indicated that you intend to look at post-marketing surveillance of the vaccine, such as the Yellow Card monitoring and reporting system. The reality is that, despite the presence of this system, we still have no idea how many people have actually had an adverse reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine. For example, according to figures updated in April 2023, 53.8 million people in the UK had the first dose of the Covid vaccine and 50.7 million people had the second. Those numbers are reported up until September of last year. That leaves just over 3 million people, or 6% of the UK population, who stopped after the first dose. That is clearly 6% of the population who did not come forward for the second part of what was clearly marketed as a two-part vaccine and, my Lady, you should be concerned about the reasons why that 6% did not take the second dose. One reason may have been that they did not feel able to have the second dose because of how unwell the first dose made them feel.

So in our submission the Inquiry should, as a matter of urgency, investigate firstly the effectiveness of the passive reporting system, such as the Yellow Card scheme, and, secondly, any other ways to determine exactly how many people have been impacted by an adverse reaction.

The Covid-19 vaccine was a novel vaccine on a global scale, so adverse reactions to it must have been expected. The Yellow Card system was not able to cope with a medication response of this magnitude and we submit there should have been a bespoke reporting system for this vaccine which should have collected proper data and have involved follow-up care to ensure the wellbeing of those who report it.

As part of this bespoke scheme, data could have been collected from those who submitted reports, for example on ethnicity, gender, age, medical history and blood type, which could have then indicated relevant factors that could point to why particular groups reacted to the vaccine.

The pandemic provided a one-off opportunity to monitor and record potential adverse reactions, given they must have been expected, but this data has not been collected.

Moving to my next topic, Mr Wald reminded us this morning that the scope of Module 4 is necessarily provisional and we're grateful for that indication. My Lady, we submit that you should include within your scope the issue of support for the vaccine injured and bereaved. In our submission, your Inquiry should include an examination of why those individuals have been discriminated against in the provision of healthcare services, and in particular why they have been denied equal access to appropriate medical testing to help identify relatively common pathologies in post-vaccine patients, and a specialist cohort of medical professional who can contribute to research and inform clinical guidelines and a dedicated research hospital.

My Lady, it should be the concern of this Inquiry that there is currently no appropriate treatment of vaccine-induced illness and injury, or an appropriate level of psychological and emotional support, or adequate financial support for those we represent.

The vaccine injured and bereaved have spent the past three years, both individually and as a collective, asking for help from this country's medical professionals, mainstream media and members of parliament. They have been met with standard responses that promote the vaccine and that completely fail to address the needs of the injured and bereaved. An analogy can be drawn with listening to someone who has been in a serious car accident and then telling them about all the benefits of cars and then how many people haven't been killed by cars. No other medical condition or injury is treated in this way.

Turning then to the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. My Lady, you have stated in your provisional scope that you will examine whether any reforms are necessary. In short, they are, and what is required is both radical and urgent. It's the clear view of those I represent, a large number of whom have made claims under the scheme, that it is no longer fit for purpose.

As of July of this year the scheme has received a total of 6,399 claims, of which 2,352 have been notified of an outcome. Over 500 of those claims have been waiting for more than 12 months, with 166 of them waiting for over 18 months to receive an outcome. 96% of those claims have been refused. Many have been turned down on causation, despite having evidence from multiple consultants that their injuries started following vaccination and despite received exemptions and despite having an adverse reaction recorded in their permanent medical records.

Only 127 claimants have received an award, while 177 claims were unsuccessful solely because they did not meet the 60% disablement criteria, even though causation was accepted. This highlights, my Lady, the inherent shortcomings of the current all or nothing scheme, leaving those claimants without any award. By comparison, before the pandemic, in 2019 to 2020, out of 70 claims made, only one claim was rejected for failing to meet the disability criteria.

VIBUK have been campaigning for the government to reform the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme in particular to improve the time it takes to assess and award claims, to remove the limited eligibility and criteria for causation and amend the one size fits all award and payment, which should have no upper limit.

My Lady, we also ask that as part of your examination you review the care pathway provided to ensure appropriate medical and emotional support to the vaccine injured and bereaved, the lack of a trauma-informed approach to the claiming process from start to finish, and the qualifications and relevant experience of the medical assessors employed to analyse VDPS claims and appeals.

I now turn to my fourth topic, that of disclosure and experts. In our written submissions we made a specific request for cross-disclosure of evidence from Modules 1 and 2A and C on vaccines, and we're grateful for the indication this morning that the Module 4 team is checking requests both in the Rule 9s from other modules, and that disclosure will be reviewed. In our submission this review needs to be thorough and broad.

In respect of experts, my Lady, we ask for early conversations with the Inquiry legal team about those experts under consideration. Those we represent have a deep understanding of those with expertise in the issues that impact on them and can provide meaningful assistance to the Inquiry in this regard. There was nothing identified, however, by Mr Wald this morning about experts who can provide the Inquiry with the expertise on the mechanism of adverse vaccine injury, for example haematologists, cardiologists, immunologists, just to name a few relevant specialisms. So we'd hope that dialogue can continue on that topic.

May I turn now to address the listening exercise. I'm grateful for the confirmation that the Inquiry wants to hear from those who suffered vaccine damage as a result of the vaccine roll-out. However, despite this stated aim, our clients note with concern that none of the key lines of enquiry seek to research the injury and bereavement caused by the Covid-19 vaccine. In our submission, the Inquiry cannot simply ignore the reality of this lived experience for an unknown number of people, and the Inquiry should be targeting research and evidence that allows it to properly understand the number, the nature and the degree of these injuries in order to fully establish the facts surrounding them, which in turn can then inform your findings, my Lady, and any concrete recommendations for future health crises.

My final but important topic, then, my Lady, is how the Inquiry ensures effective participation for those we represent, and we are grateful for recognition by Counsel to the Inquiry that those we represent have relevant evidence to give, and we ask you, my Lady, to consider from the outset how you will hear from those we represent at the oral evidence hearings. They are the only individuals who can give first-hand evidence to you of their experience of vaccine injury, their experience of reporting the injury, and their experience of the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme.

We are grateful for the timetable set out this morning in respect of future hearings, and Mr Wald King's Counsel has indicated that the Inquiry will give as much notice as possible for deadlines. If there is a standardised process of deadlines that can be shared, not just for counsel's convenience but which gives proper time for those of our clients whose injuries impact upon their vision, their concentration, their processing and recall, to consider documents provided by the Inquiry and by their legal team and to give their instructions on them, we would be grateful.

Some of those we represent, my Lady, have gone to considerable effort to be here today, and I urge the Inquiry not to assume that because they are here and because they look well, that they are actually not struggling. They are all living and managing acute and chronic health conditions. Standing or even breathing is a struggle, and we ask the Inquiry and its staff to please bear this in mind. They will need facilities in the hearing centre to be available to them to stand, sit, lie and move in a way of their choosing to enable them to be able to properly follow the evidence and engage with your Inquiry. We are grateful for the welcome they have received this morning from your hearing staff.

In addition, we do echo the submissions made by the bereaved families for the provision of satellite venues for those we represent, which would mean that they could then attend without the arduous travel. For example, a number who sit here today have travelled from Glasgow and there are others across the UK who would want to watch the proceedings but be with others for emotional support, particularly given their difficulties in accessing support outside of their own communities. There may also be barriers to those individuals engaging online because of vision or cognitive impairment.

So, my Lady, in conclusion, and without risking the patience and the stomachs of the stenographer and others, the UK CV Family, the Scottish Vaccine Injury Group and the Vaccine Injured Bereaved, are grateful for designation as core participants and are here to assist you and your Inquiry. This Inquiry is an historic opportunity to properly recognise and record their experiences away from the misinformation and political agendas, to build trust in our medical and public institutions and our medica, and for you to make clear and concrete recommendations that will have a significant impact on their lives and those of millions of others.

Thank you, my Lady, those are my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Morris.

We shall return at 2.10, please.

*(1.10 pm)*
