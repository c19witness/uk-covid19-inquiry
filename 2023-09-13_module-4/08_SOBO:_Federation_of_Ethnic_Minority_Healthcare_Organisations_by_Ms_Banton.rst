8. Submissions on Behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations by Ms Banton
====================================================================================================

**Ms Banton**: My Lady, I am, as you know, Elaine Banton, with a counsel team of Mr Philip Dayle, Mr Ifeanyi Odogwu and Ms Una Morris, represent the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations, FEHMO. We are led by Mr Leslie Thomas KC and are instructed by the firm Saunders Law.

FEMHO is a prominent consortium, giving voice to the concerns of ethnically diverse Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic health and social care professionals. FEHMO's primary goal is to rectify and shine a light on the inequalities these individuals encounter within the health and social care in the United Kingdom.

My Lady, I'm most grateful for the opportunity to address you briefly on five matters: scope or areas for investigation; experts; listening exercise; witnesses; and recommendations.

The FEHMO client base consists of highly skilled and knowledgeable healthcare workers involved at the coalface of the roll-out of vaccines, and so it is helpful to provide some insights from them at this juncture.

It is imperative to probe and examine the systemic failures and inadequacies and socio-economic variables that exacerbated the adverse effects and contributed to the disproportionate impact on minority ethnic healthcare workers. Overlooking this not only perpetuates structural discrimination but also fails to address the underlying causes of the pandemic's disproportionate impact.

From the healthcare worker perspective, the inherent culture of our public health and coronavirus response mechanisms and structures disproportionately affected minority ethnic healthcare workers. These negative impacts encompassed discriminatory practices, biased assignments to high-risk areas, inadequate and insufficient PPE, a dearth of risk assessment, a lack of comprehensive epidemiological data and mapping and more.

It is empirically evident that incorporating diversity into strategy formulation and implementation results will exponentially bring about better outcomes. Equitable representation, diversity and consideration of vulnerability and mitigating measures all act to better protect minority ethnic communities in decision-making regarding vaccines and treatments in the light of known pre-existing factors.

So firstly I'd like to address the issue in relation to scope and possible areas of investigation. So to aid the Inquiry's efforts, FEHMO would like to suggest some key areas or focal points for investigation.

Firstly, issues around vaccine confidence amongst Black, Asian and Ethnic Minority healthcare workers and wider communities, and the role which thematic lack of data on ethnicity played.

Secondly, the role played by government communication and messaging and decisions taken by the Vaccine Taskforce, along with accessibility in terms of language and the absence of clear and accessible official information which led to the spread of disinformation.

Thirdly, the inadequacy of the Yellow Card system and data collection on outcomes and adverse reactions, particularly amongst Ethnic Minority communities. It's a simple but important practical aspect. To improve this would be to develop culturally sensitive and multilingual information or materials about the Yellow Card system and scheme.

Fourthly, the need for reform of the UK Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme to ensure equitable access.

Fifthly, the role FEHMO members played within the community, stepping in to fill the void left by the government's failure to produce effective messaging or engage with ethnically diverse communities in a culturally sensitive fashion.

Sixthly, the lack of investment in research trials and development of therapeutics specifically designed to meet the unique physiological characteristics and health conditions prevalent among minority ethnic populations, thus perpetuating health disparities, the lack of consideration given to tailoring treatment plans in recognition of racial ethnic differences in clinical presentation and response to drug treatment.

And lastly, the systemic lack of diversity and underrepresentation in Covid-19 research and trials, despite the disproportionately high infection rates amongst Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic healthcare workers and communities, which also affected the efficacy and fuelled distrust amongst our members' communities.

These challenges were foreseeable and were known, and with effective preparation the government could and should have anticipated them. They should not have taken the government by surprise had effective planning been in place. These were unprecedented times, undoubtedly, but a lot was known regarding the complexities of vaccine take-up. Adopting an informed, culturally sensitive approach would have undoubtedly equipped us better. There is a body of research and expertise that could and should have been consulted with sooner.

The adoption of a colour blind approach was not fit for purpose and is wholly inconsistent with the Equality Act 2010 and in particular the public sector equality duty to have due regard to the elimination of discrimination.

It's impossible to eliminate discrimination if one is blind to the differences in race or ethnicity; or, in other words, treating everybody the same leads to disparate outcomes.

Concerted engagement with the public sector equality duty, together with enhanced reporting and monitoring of the equality impact assessments may be beneficial here.

My Lady, there's already been comment made on Rule 9 requests. Our position has been noted, so I will not repeat that further.

In respect of experts, FEHMO submits that there's a manifest need for specialists in structural racism and other forms of discriminatory practices, especially considering the trends observed in reports so far.

FEHMO strongly submits that Module 4 warrants expert testimony on racial equality that will address the ingrained systemic challenges related to the equity of therapeutics, vaccine development trials and distribution.

We welcome the indication that the Inquiry will have expert evidence on inequalities on vaccine roll-out and public messaging and hesitancy, misinformation and disinformation, as indicated. However, we also submit that the discrimination experts instructed should be invited to consider these issues against broader root causes of racial disparity and discrimination, which include the disengagement with the issue of race and inequality across the public sector and the lack of diversity and inclusion in senior leadership within key structures such as the NHS.

If we may also suggest, it would be advantageous for experts to adopt, where feasible, an integrated, intersectional approach that accounts for the multiplicity of experiences.

Whilst the Equality Act itself does not take a joined-up approach, section 14 of the Equality Act is not yet in force, so it's not got a joined-up approach in respect of protected characteristics, for that reason. However, the adoption of an intersectional approach mirrors the position experienced in real life. We are a make-up of a collection of protected characteristics. For example, a disabled black woman or a young Muslim man, an elderly man, and so on.

In terms of the listening exercise, FEHMO offers the following suggestions in relation to the KLOEs for the listening exercise:

- Experience of health and social care workers in respect to the proposed VCOD and handling of the same;

- A targeted group using culturally sensitive means to reach minority ethnic health and social care workers.

- Experiences of those who took an active role in their communities in regard to the vaccine and their interaction with public agencies.

My Lady, we also submit that the phrase "vaccine hesitancy" is in itself problematic and perpetuates negative blaming connotations. We invite the Inquiry to consider using "vaccine confidence" or "unconfidence" instead. "Hesitancy", as we say, signals that blame aspect, and potentially the word "caution" might be another word preferred.

In terms of witnesses, we urge the Inquiry to hear evidence from our members who have first-hand lived experience of the impact of decision-making and procurement of Covid-19 vaccines and the pervasive exacerbating effect inequalities had on every aspect of the healthcare system before, during and post-pandemic.

In conclusion, my Lady, FEHMO states, on interim recommendations, this modular nature of the Inquiry presents as a unique opportunity to instigate agile and prompt improvements, and further prevent adverse consequences rather than waiting until the end of the hearings.

Unless I may assist you further, my Lady, those are my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Banton. You make some important points, and obviously I shall bear them all very much in mind. Thank you.

**Ms Banton**: Thank you so much.

**Lady Hallett**: Right, I think -- am I going to have to move again? -- Ms Naik.
