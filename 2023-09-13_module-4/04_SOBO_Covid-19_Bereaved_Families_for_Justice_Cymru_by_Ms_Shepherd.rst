4. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru by Ms Shepherd
========================================================================================

**Ms Shepherd**: Prynhawn da, good afternoon, my Lady.

I represent Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice

Cymru. At the outset, we wish to thank the Chair for

granting the bereaved families core participant status in this module. We feel that we have an important role to play in this module as we have a stake in how pharmaceutical interventions were used or not used by public bodies when responding to the pandemic.

There are four particular areas on which I wish to address you. Firstly, scope. Second, Every Story Matters. Thirdly, evidence in disclosure. Fourthly, expert evidence.

Dealing firstly then with scope, your Ladyship may have gathered from our written submissions that we have limited comments to make in respect of scope, as we consider the provisional scope to be sufficiently broad to encompass the areas which were of concern to those we represent. However, we wish to take this opportunity to briefly set out our stall on the issues which are of those particular concern to those we represent.

Those represented by CBFJ Cymru welcomed the opportunity to have the vaccine and many wished only that it could have been available sooner. Indeed, some members feel that had they been able to receive the vaccine sooner then their family members may not have died.

This is why it is of particular importance to those we represent to understand how decisions were made regarding prioritisation. Audit Wales have already identified one area of concern, and that was the way in which NHS staff received their vaccine ahead of their allotted priority group. Of course, when it comes to a matter such as this, there are many competing views about who should be at the top of the list, however, we submit that it is proper and right to subject the decisions made about prioritisation to sufficient scrutiny.

Further, we consider that the manner in which the vaccine was rolled out should be scrutinised. We note that the Welsh Government in their written submissions ahead of this preliminary hearing have identified that this is an area where regional and local issues sometimes required different approaches. Those who I represent hope that this can be explored in this module. It is their experience that there was a patchy approach with different decisions being taken by local health boards rather than a centrally-run and organised strategy.

In particular, those we represent want to know whether sufficient consideration was given to the inequalities or barriers faced by those living in rural communities and whether the older population and those who had comorbidities had particular difficulties in accessing the vaccine. They had been shielding for many months. For some people, going to have their vaccine may have been the first time that they left their house or went into a room with a large number of people. If they couldn't drive, they may have had to take public transport. We would welcome scrutiny of whether sufficient consideration was given to the challenges that they would have faced when accessing the vaccine.

We also ask the Inquiry to look at decisions made regarding antivirals, particularly in the months before the vaccine became available. CBFJ Cymru are grateful to Mr Wald KC for making clear that therapeutics in practice will fall within the scope of Module 3.

We are, however, concerned about access to antivirals and, therefore, we welcome scrutiny in this module as to how the preceding phases were managed and what steps were taken by public bodies to enable the use of antivirals where appropriate.

Finally, in relation to scope, there is an area where we would invite further thought. At present, the provisional scope does not appear to cover the issues of what is sometimes referred to as vaccine mandates or vaccine passports in the shorthand. In reality, the issue is whether it is right to require people to show proof of vaccination before they are allowed to undertake certain activities. It was the experience of many who live in Wales that they had to show proof of vaccination or, in lieu of that, proof of a negative lateral flow test.

An area which is of concern to those we represent, as I know your Ladyship is aware, is nosocomial infection or hospital-acquired Covid-19. CBFJ Cymru is particularly focused on how matters were dealt with in Wales and how the decisions made by the Welsh Government compare with those made by the other three nations which make up the UK.

This is an area of divergence. There was no requirement for healthcare workers to be vaccinated in Wales as there was elsewhere in the UK. We want to understand the rationale for this decision, particularly as we understand that there was a concern to maintain a four nations approach unless there was good reason to depart from it. We wish to understand what that good reason was.

To that end, my Lady, if I could adopt the submission made by my learned friend Ms McDermott, we would also endorse a comparative approach in this module.

If I could turn then to Every Story Matters. We have been asked to outline the key lines of enquiry and we hope that your Ladyship's Inquiry legal team find it helpful to see our proposals at this early stage. Every Story Matters is an important process for those I represent. CBFJ Cymru members have important information to impart regarding their experiences.

We wish, therefore, to assist the Inquiry in whichever way we can. We ask that our core participants are given the opportunity to give evidence at the public hearings, particularly where their individual stories can speak to systemic issues.

Thirdly, I wish to deal with the issues of evidence and disclosure. We echo the sentiment expressed in the written submission made by the Welsh Government that those who suffered loss deserve no less than complete and candid answers to their questions. We look forward to a process which allows proper reflection on the important subject matter of this Inquiry. We trust that we will receive full and timely disclosure so that core participants have information available when they need it so that all questions that need to be asked can be asked. Regrettably, this was not our experience in Module 1. We did address this in our written submissions at the end of Module 1, so I won't trespass over old ground here today.

Fourthly, expert evidence. It has been a consistent theme that the expert evidence provided to the Inquiry to date has not addressed issues which are specific to Wales. Data has been provided which is either not specific to Wales or simply has not been collected in Wales. We therefore urge the Inquiry to instruct experts who have sufficient experience or knowledge of the system in Wales to be able to enable them to speak to the issues which are particular to Wales. At present, there are three experts listed, and those are in relation to vaccine safety, inequalities in roll-out and vaccine hesitancy.

The second submission, therefore, I wish to make in respect of expert evidence is we ask the Inquiry to consider whether there should be an expert instructed in relation to therapeutics and in particular antiviral medication.

Finally, the procedure for asking questions of witnesses during the public hearings. This is a very important aspect of the process for the bereaved and as such we invite the Inquiry to continue the process which was adopted in Module 1 through to this module, so that we may have input into the questions asked of witnesses.

Unless you require any further assistance, my Lady, that concludes my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Shepherd, very helpful.

Right, Mr McCaffery, I think you're attending remotely.
