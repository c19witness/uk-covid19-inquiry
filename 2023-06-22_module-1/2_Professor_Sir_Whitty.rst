*PROFESSOR SIR CHRIS WHITTY (sworn).*

Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry

**Lady Hallett**: Please sit down.

**Mr Keith**: Sir Chris, thank you for your assistance. My Lady is aware that you have provided a number of witness statements, both to this module and in fact to Module 2. Whilst I ask questions, could you please remember to keep your voice up so that we may hear you properly, and also so that your evidence may be recorded by the stenographer. If I ask you a question which is not clear, please don't refrain from asking me to repeat it.

Sir Chris, you are, as is very well known, an infectious disease epidemiology and acute medicine clinician. You are and you have been now for some time the Chief Medical Officer for England.

You were appointed on 2 October 2019 as Chief Medical Officer for England and, in essence, that is the Chief Medical Adviser to His Majesty's Government. Is that correct?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: (Witness nods)

**Lead Inquiry**: Was your predecessor Professor Dame Sally Davies and have your deputies been, at one time, Professor Sir Jonathan Van-Tam, until 2022, and Professor Dame Jenny Harries, until 2021, when she became chief executive of the United Kingdom Health Security Agency?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Those are all correct. The one thing just to -- a minor amendment, is that I stopped doing acute medicine when I took up the role of Chief Medical Officer in 2019, but I still do infectious diseases and, indeed, over the Covid period did 12 weeks' rota on the words for Covid over that period. So I saw it firsthand and I can say to the families who are here I saw the extraordinary impact and devastation that had for individuals and the families.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you. Before that, before you were appointed Chief Medical Officer, were you the Chief Scientific Adviser for the Department of Health and Social Care between 2016 and 2021, so there was an overlap in fact?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Were you also formerly head of the National Institute for Health Research, NIHR?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: I believe that you were interim Government Chief Scientific Adviser between 2017 and 2018?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: You were the Chief Scientific Adviser at DfID. You were until very recently a member of the executive board of the World Health Organisation, and you remain, I believe, a member of the Department of Health and Social Care's Executive Committee, ExCo.

There are, if I may say, too many honorifics, qualifications and fellowships with a huge range of august bodies for me to list them, but you are, by training, a professor of public and international health and you were a professor of public and international health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and, perhaps primarily, a fellow of the Royal Society, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Royal College of Physicians and an honorary fellow at a number of other organisations?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: For the particular purposes of addressing the issue of preparedness, were you involved in the response to many United Kingdom and global medical and wider emergencies?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I was, over quite a period of time.

**Lead Inquiry**: Were you concerned, therefore, with the response to the HIV emergency, health emergency, to the Ebola emergency, and the emergencies connected to the Zika outbreak abroad and the Novichok poisonings in Salisbury and Amesbury?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes to all of those, and the HIV was as a clinician rather than as a member of government.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you.

Have you also been at various times a chair or a member of a number of the important advisory disease committees which exist within the United Kingdom?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. Well, we'll come back to the detail of those in due course.

Also, and it's relevant again to this module, together with the Chief Medical Officers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Government Chief Scientific Adviser and the NHS National Medical Director and a number of other people including relevant Deputy Chief Medical Officers in the United Kingdom, did you write what is known as the Technical report on the Covid-19 pandemic in the [United Kingdom]?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I did. This was aimed specifically at our successors, so it's in places quite technical, as the title implies, but it is, I hope, helpful to this Inquiry and indeed more generally to lay out some of the scientific and medical issues.

**Lead Inquiry**: So that we may get our bearings, is it a report, a very considerable report, addressing the questions of disparities, research, situational awareness, modelling, testing, contact tracing, NPIs, care homes, pharmaceutical interventions, improvements in the care of Covid and communications. So traversing, in fact, the whole scope of the response to Covid and the preparedness for Covid with which you were directly personally and professionally concerned?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

I don't propose, Sir Chris, to ask you about matters which more properly fall within the scope of Module 2, so let me make it absolutely plain, there will be no questions today about the government's response to the pandemic. Those are matters for the future.

I'd like you instead to focus, please, firstly on some of the structures which play a very important role in the emergency preparedness resilience and response system in the United Kingdom.

As the Chief Medical Officer, are you assisted by a body known as the Office of the Chief Medical Officer? If so, what is that?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So I am and am very fortunate to have a very able but small group, as Dame Sally said in her evidence. Normally this runs as it does at the moment at around 12 people, which includes myself and the Deputy Chief Medical Officers, and then some private secretaries and medical -- public health registrars.

**Lead Inquiry**: With the benefit of the hindsight that comes with responding to the Covid pandemic, is there anything that you would wish to say about the size of that office or the degree of assistance or the resources associated with it? Did it stand the test of time in light of the terrible demands of the pandemic?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: My view is that the size, which expanded up to about 19 people at peak during the pandemic, was the right one for the job we were asked to do, which was advisory. There were others who helped me with some of my more executive functions because I was still, in the early stages, running the National Institute for Health Research. That was a significant, slightly different body of work. But my general view is a small, very, very good group is easier to provide clear advice to people than a much larger and often more unwieldy group.

**Lead Inquiry**: Turning then to some of the other bodies concerned in the EPRR system, is it important to distinguish between those bodies which provide on a permanent basis scientific advice and those bodies which are, to use a terrible modern colloquialism, stood up to deal with the response to civil emergencies? Does that divide exist, and why does it matter?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So that divide does exist. There are a number of bodies which give advice irrespective of whether there's an emergency or not. Some of those are relevant in emergencies, if they happen in their area of work. So, for example, the group NERVTAG, which we may come back to either now or in later modules, I know you've had previous evidence on it, was very important in this emergency and it also runs between emergencies. But there's an apparatus that stands up particularly around SAGE for major emergencies which acts both as a way of funneling information to central government in a coherent way, but also, and I think this is important in the way we think about it, as a co-ordination mechanism for how to prioritise the advice that's given.

So I actually think during emergencies there is better co-ordination of scientific advice than there is outwith emergencies, and I think that actually may be a weakness between emergencies.

**Lead Inquiry**: In your witness statement, you state that the United Kingdom science advisory system, and we are concerned only now with the particular committees and the particular groups that give specific advice, is a complex one and not perfect but is considered to be one of the stronger ones internationally.

Is it your view that whilst changes could be debated and recommended perhaps to some of the individual committees and their remit, their diversity and their constitution, in a general sense there is no systemic weakness in the system by which scientific advice is provided pre-emergency?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think that there is -- there are no structural problems that I think need to be changed. There can be issues as you say of detail. I'm always quite cautious of changing structures as a way of trying to fix problems. However, I think what this did demonstrate was that whilst the system can be extremely fast-moving during an emergency, I think it is sometimes less well co-ordinated between emergencies, and I think from that some problems actually arose.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that a problem which emanates from the way in which committees may be brought up to speed at great speed in the face of an emergency, and therefore placed under very considerable pressure by contrast to their normal operating procedures?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think it's more that it is very clear they're operating around a single aim and all feed into that single aim, whereas the danger in between issues -- and I think Dame Sally has raised the issue of, were we imaginative enough, were we radical enough in our thinking, for example, about prevention, I think it is quite difficult to be radical when you've got a very diffuse system, it's much easier to do that, actually, when you've got the whole system operating together. So the SAGE mechanism allowed for much faster decision-making and much more focused and, in my view, more radical thinking than occurred between emergencies.

**Lead Inquiry**: But SAGE is of course a response body?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Exactly.

**Lead Inquiry**: We will come back to the issue of groupthink, as it's been described, a little later. But in terms, again, of the structures, that is to say the existence of the various committees, putting aside the detail perhaps of their composition and scope, would, in your view, any significant change in the structures lead to an appreciable improvement?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Not in my view. You need to have people who are similar enough that they can have a serious conversation and difficult enough that they can challenge one another and bring different perspectives, and I think the structure is probably a reasonable point between the two extremes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is there any better international system used by other countries which is worth emulating or not?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: We've looked around the world. I mean, there are bits of other systems, certainly in the global west and north, which we've learnt from. But I think generally the UK is seen to be a very strong system.

I think what we don't probably have as much sight of is, for example, systems in China or some of the other countries in Asia, and I think it is an opportunity to rethink: are there things we could learn from those parts of the world? But certainly in Europe, in North America and other countries we normally deal with, I think most people would see the UK as having a strong system.

**Lead Inquiry**: May I ask you about two generic risks that you identify in your second witness statement concerning the personal composition of these advisory groups, that is to say the members of the groups.

Firstly, do you identify that going forward there is a growing risk in relation to the availability of the requisitely qualified and expert members to take part in this committee work? Is there a problem developing in relation to the ability of such experts to make themselves available for potentially quite lengthy periods of time?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I mean, I think we have been extraordinarily lucky in the UK of having a tradition of the best people doing this, and this has happened over very many years. I think there are two potential threats that we need to be very alive to, the first of which is the university system has got more hawkish, if I can put it that way, about recovery of time and what are the people that they're paying spending their time doing. I see this as a very major part of the contribution of science to society, but obviously for individual institutions that's an issue. So that's a kind of mechanistic one.

Then I do think that what occurred during Covid, where the level of abuse and, in some cases, threat to people who volunteered their time is an extremely concerning one, and one we should be very firm in saying that the society very much appreciates the work of these people, who put in enormous amounts of time, usually at no recompense.

**Lead Inquiry**: You would no doubt have given some considerable thought to that issue, because of course you were, I'm very sorry to say, a recipient of some of that disgraceful behaviour.

Is there anything that can be done other than calling it out and making it absolutely plain that the inevitable consequence of such sort of abuse will be a diminution in the co-operation and assistance that's given by people such as yourself?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think the main thing is to make sure that people who do this understand that their work is very thoroughly appreciated by the great majority of the population, which I think it is.

**Lead Inquiry**: Again, still at quite a high level, may I ask you to consider, please, the departmental Chief Scientific Adviser system to which you refer in your witness statement.

Is this the system under which, as my Lady has heard, each major government department has or should have in place a senior scientist to provide advice, to co-ordinate with other Chief Medical Officers across government in a cross-governmental way, to give advice to each department, and also to ensure that there is a consistency of approach across government?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes. I think that most of the Chief Scientific Advisers, not absolutely all, are seconded in from academia, either part-time or full-time. The advantage of this is it brings some degree of independence, it brings some degree of external challenge, but it also brings in different expertise, and I think this was seen during Covid. So many of the Chief Scientific Advisers, were doing roles in the Covid response which were relevant to their particular skills, although it wasn't the thing for which they had been brought in. So, for example, Professor Watts, in the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, is a specialist in social -- some aspects of social science, as well as mathematical sciences, she was very influential. Dame Angela McLean, now the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, was then at MoD, the defence department, but she was an academic epidemiologist and modeller of great reknown and so on. So people brought their personal skills alongside their departmental skills, and I think this was a very useful part of our response.

**Lead Inquiry**: Does the close working network between departmental Chief Scientific Advisers in each department allow for rapid transmission of technical information to each department?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes, and it allows for a degree of essentially technical discussion between who know one another and then they can disseminate in their department in the way that is best suited for that department.

**Lead Inquiry**: Does the fact that Chief Scientific Advisers come from different professions and different parts of the scientific world assist in any way in the ability to challenge orthodoxy, to ensure that the thinking is sufficiently lateral and open to challenge?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think it helps, but I think we should all acknowledge that the wider you can go in terms of external challenge the better, because science works best when you have external challenge from multiple directions.

**Lead Inquiry**: Again, before we look at SAGE in detail, and again at quite a high level of generality, do you have any views as to whether or not there is sufficient diversity within the scientific world, in terms of the composition of these various committees and advisory groups, to ensure that essentially the advice that's been given to government is sufficiently broad?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Well, I think you've always got a tension: the more you broaden things out, the wider the range of experiences and skills and diversity of thinking you get, and the more unwieldy the committee becomes. I think what you've got to do is get a balance between those two. What you don't want is everybody going round the table saying a single thing, no ability to challenge because it's too big. So it's getting the balance between those two, but I think on the whole the system works reasonable well. But, the big but is, of course, it also depends on an enormous amount of science underpinning it, and it should depend on people being able to challenge what's said from the external environment as well, because that provides some of the additional challenge into the system.

**Lead Inquiry**: Turning then just to four of the particular groups to which you made reference in your witness statement. Firstly, NERVTAG, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, of which my Lady has heard much in the last two weeks. Is this an expert committee, in fact, of the DHSC? Is it a committee which advises the Chief Medical Officer and, through you, ministers and the DHSC and other government departments in relation to, as it says on the tin, new and emerging respiratory viral threats?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: A point made by Professor Whitworth and Dr Hammer in their report, which I'm sure you've seen, is that one potential weakness with NERVTAG is, as it says, it only considers respiratory viruses and not the whole range of emerging infections. Is there a case for a tweak in the scope of any of these committees or groups, particularly NERVTAG, to ensure that nothing does fall between two stools?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think there is a potential weakness on this actually. As I laid out in my written witness statement, there are broadly five routes by which infections which could become epidemics or pandemics can go through. NERVTAG covers respiratory but it doesn't cover the others, for example touch or sexual transmission. I mean, you've got to remember that the last very big pandemic we had affecting the UK was HIV, which is completely different, it's a sexually transmitted, intravenously transmitted infection, completely different route of transmission, completely different disease.

There was a body called the National Expert Panel on New and Emerging Infections, bit of a mouthful, NEPNEI, which did have that wider role but that was, for reasons I'm not actually sure of, I wasn't involved in this decision, stopped. I was previously chair of it so I knew its work, and --

**Lead Inquiry**: You knew it had stopped, presumably?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: No, I had ceased to be chair before it stopped, yes, and I think there is an argument for saying we need to cover these other areas because risks do come from multiple directions.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did NEPNEI provide expert advice directly to the CMO on the public health risks associated from new and emerging infections generally, so not respiratory viruses?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: That was their job.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was it in fact disbanded about ten years ago, does that sound about right?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: That's about right, yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: One of the points, going back to NERVTAG, made by a number of witnesses, in particular your colleague Professor Sir Jonathan Van-Tam, was that NERVTAG, because it is concerned with new and emerging respiratory viral threats, was in his view and -- and is not in his view asked to predict threats that might emerge in the future, that there is obviously a lack of prospective examination because it's not concerned with, on its -- in terms of its terms of reference, with anything other than a present continuing emerging viral threat.

Is that a weakness in the scope?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think it -- realistically the danger is you can end up with almost infinite numbers of theoretical threats. The sensible thing is to concentrate on threats which may look small at the moment but could expand very significantly, so, for example, MERS virus, another coronavirus, currently has relatively small numbers of cases every year, but it could expand very rapidly. We definitely need to have information about that, just to give an example.

I think thinking about theoretical ones is much more difficult, but you do need to understand the range -- not you need to, but we all need to understand the range of possible scenarios, ranging from very, very high mortality, very low mortality, different routes of transmission, different forces of transmission, different age structures of disease, and that doesn't -- you can't ask a single committee to cover all of that waterfront. What you do need to do is to allow for the possibility that they could come from almost any place.

**Lead Inquiry**: Does NERVTAG sit continuously or at least peripatetically, it sits from time to time, to consider constantly new and emerging threats, or does it respond to and act upon specific commissions from the government? So might a government department say of NERVTAG, "Could you please look at this particular issue", or is it open to NERVTAG to raise of its own volition a matter which it believes is of concern or should be of concern to the government?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So certainly -- it's certainly able to. I mean, when I've chaired scientific advisory committees or equivalents, my kind of view has always been about a 80/20 rule, which is if you spend all of your time considering things that only the committee is interested in and the government is not, then you're probably not going to get much traction. Equally, if you're only restricting yourself to the things which the government has raised, you may be missing either important things which the experts spot or, occasionally, issues which are inconvenient to government but need to be aired.

So I think that most of the time should be spent on things the government is asked about but a significant minority should be spent on things the government has not asked about, for whatever reason.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is the drawing of that difficult dividing line a matter that should, in your view, be left to the expertise and good sense of the members of the group as opposed to the application of some sort of prescriptive system?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes, I mean, the number that I made was a made-up number but I'm illustrating the kind of rough divisions I think there should be. This really should be in the hands of the independent chair. They're selected to be one of the experts in the country, they're usually a very senior academic, and they can discuss with the secretariat and say, "This is what I want to do", but my view is there should be some latitude, otherwise the committees can become the creatures of government, which is not the right approach.

**Lead Inquiry**: Professor Whitworth and Dr Hammer referred to a second group, the Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance group, HAIRS, which is a multi-agency cross-government horizon scanning and risk assessment group with, I think, a number of representatives from across government on it.

Is its scope, despite the fact -- well, as it says, animal infections, it considers only potentially zoonotic infections, that is to say animal infections, and not the whole range of emerging infections?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: That is correct. But there is a very large overlap, in fact, but again it starts from zoo -- it starts from animal diseases and works out which of those have zoonotic potential, that is to say have the potential to jump from animals to humans. That's really what its principal aim is. It's got a slightly wider aim but that's its principal aim.

**Lead Inquiry**: But there is no question, is there, of there being a gap between two stools? Whether or not the infection is zoonotic or otherwise, there is in existence a group or committee which will be looking at the issue of an emerging threat?

Sir Chris, could I -- I apologise -- just ask you to keep your answers -- to make your answers a little bit slower. Whilst, if I may say so, your evidence is wonderfully clear, it's very difficult to transcribe.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: My enthusiasm is running away with me.

**Lead Inquiry**: So my question is whether or not an emerging threat is zoonotic or not, there is at least in existence a committee or a group that will be keeping its eye firmly fixed on the nature of the emerging threat?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: There should be, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

The last committee I wanted to ask you about is the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, ACDP. This is a DHSC committee. To what extent does that committee, concerned as it is with dangerous pathogens, overlap with those committees that deal with zoonotic and other emerging infections?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So that committee, which I very briefly chaired, again when I was outside government, when I -- sorry -- is principally aimed at infections we know about and which, if they were introduced into a laboratory, for example, could be a risk to the people who are dealing with it, or could be a risk to people in hospital or people who come into contact with someone. They tend to be the diseases that have got very high mortality, so something like Ebola where, untreated, maybe 70% of people who catch it would die. So those very high consequence infections will be the most common, but a variety of other infections which have to be handled particularly carefully in terms of either their clinical or their laboratory management.

**Lead Inquiry**: So, standing back, is it your view that the broad range of advice compendiously provided by the various groups and committees is right: there is no significant issue in relation to omission or too great a degree of overlap or of ministers in the government not receiving the advice, in a general sense, that it requires?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think that in terms of identifying risks I think that the waterfront is quite well covered. There are some gaps which -- but they are not huge ones, in my view. I think in terms of what the response should be, I think that's a much more -- I'm much less certain that that is covered well by the current system.

**Lead Inquiry**: Let us then look at that, please. Are you in fact really referring to SAGE, to which you referred earlier, which is the primary response body stood up, to use that phrase, in the event of an emergency to provide, of course, scientific advice on emergencies?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: If I may just go back one step from that.

**Lead Inquiry**: Please.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: You know, I think central to a lot of the debate that you've had over the last several weeks, and in the excellent written statements to the Inquiry, has been the point that we should have had a more imaginative approach to how we would respond to a major pandemic, whether it was influenza, something like influenza, or indeed something else. But this would require quite radical changes in the way people think.

Now, I don't think the current committee system, which is excellent, is designed to inject radicalism of that size into the situation. It's very good at responding, it's very good at horizon scanning, in my view, relative to what is realistic.

So I think that is potentially the big weakness in the system: how do you inject radicalism into the system, rather than how do you respond to expertise.

**Lead Inquiry**: The issue of how to inject radicalism or, to put it another way, how to challenge groupthink effectively, or to put it another way, to increase the diversity of view in a committee, is a different issue, is it not, to the question of whether or not structurally this is an important and valuable committee to have?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes, exactly, and my point is simply I think the system is very good at what it does, but we should recognise that there is a gap in the system.

**Lead Inquiry**: Could we look firstly, then, at the structure and then we'll return, please, to the groupthink issue or the radicalism issue.

You have vast experience of SAGE, because you attended SAGE in your previous life as an interim governmental Chief Scientific Adviser, also as a departmental Chief Scientific Adviser, and of course now currently as the CMO, and I think as an observer for DfID when you were the Chief Scientific Adviser there.

Does SAGE sit permanently, or is it brought together in the event of an emergency?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So SAGE is brought together only in an emergency. The way in which it's brought together has changed over the last decade. So it used to be that it would only meet if it was asked to by Cabinet Office because COBR mechanism, which you were hearing about in your last session, was brought together. That's changed now, and that changed actually as a result of the Ebola crisis in West Africa. We recognised that SAGE had to be possible to bring together irrespective of whether a COBR had been called if something looked big enough to need multi-departmental and multi-scientific views.

It's called by the Government Chief Scientific Adviser -- I know you're hearing from Sir Patrick Vallance later -- but it also can be requested by other Government Chief Scientific Advisers, in terms of departmental scientific advisers or the CMO.

**Lead Inquiry**: Because it's convened by the governmental Chief Scientific Adviser, does that person also chair SAGE in all eventualities but not in the event of a health emergency?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: The Government Chief Scientific Adviser will always either chair or co-chair SAGE. If you have a SAGE, it means you've got a very big problem, and therefore that would clearly be a priority for the Government Chief Scientific Adviser of the day, and they might have to delegate it from time to time, but that would be the principle.

For health emergencies, there's usually an assumption that the Chief Medical Officer would co-chair, and in previous emergencies I have co-chaired with previous GCSAs where it was seen that my expertise was such that that would be helpful.

**Lead Inquiry**: In the event of a health emergency, as of course Covid was, you therefore chaired SAGE along with Sir Patrick Vallance?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes. I mean, I think that realistically he chaired most of the time, he is an excellent chair, but I was the co-chair and would stand in for him and would agree the agenda and sign off the minutes.

**Lead Inquiry**: The benefit, of course, of having the Chief Medical Officer co-chair SAGE in a health emergency is that the Chief Medical Officer will bring his or her medical, clinical, epidemiological experience, whatever it may be, to the table.

To what extent can SAGE call upon the expertise of experts outside the membership of SAGE? So, for example, from some of the other committees and groups to which we've referred, or individual experts and scientists outwith any of those groups.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So SAGE is set up to answer the problem that it was actually originally -- you know, if, for example, you have a volcano, you will bring in the best volcano experts from the UK, and potentially internationally if that's the right thing to do. For the Covid emergency this involved many scientists who were on the expert groups but it also involved other people who were not on those groups but were seen to have national or international expertise.

The membership shifts. There's no permanent membership of SAGE. The only person who is permanent in SAGE is the chair, the Government Chief Scientific Adviser. The other members are entirely to deal with the problems that are in front of the committee. This is to make sure you've got the right people in the room but not a large group of people, making it impossible to get to final decisions.

**Lead Inquiry**: If, Sir Christopher, the membership shifts per SAGE and if SAGE has the ability to call upon the experience of individual members of that committee with vast professional scientific experience and it can call upon the expertise of the various other committees to which you have referred and it may call upon the advice and assistance of individual experts, why is there an issue about the diversity of opinion or the absence of perhaps sufficient challenge or the absence of necessary radicalism?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Well, I think I would -- here I'd like to clearly separate between during an emergency and the period leading up to an emergency.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Actually my view was during an emergency the SAGE mechanism stood up as essentially the conductor of the orchestra. You've got around that lots of expert committees and, feeding into them, many, many scientists, the major academies and so on. So the mechanism can be fast-moving and it can pull science from multiple directions. I actually think it works pretty well. I don't really think, despite what a few people have said, that there was any weakness in the radicalism or change in opinion of SAGE once the emergency was under way. I think where things have -- and I'm happy to go through details of this -- where I think there is an issue is between emergencies there is no SAGE and therefore what you have is large numbers of expert committees doing a perfectly good job on their own, but what you don't have is an overall structure and the only situation in which they would end up in a radical place, in my view, is if they were challenged, usually by political leaders, who said, "This is a very big problem, I want you to think really widely about this".

**Lead Inquiry**: Or perhaps by an external body or agency or resilience institute or whatever it might be?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Possibly, but let us take, and I think I'm going to give a longer answer, because I think this is so central to all the evidence you've had so far.

**Lead Inquiry**: Sir Christopher, could I interrupt you very rudely to say, given the importance of the answer, please keep it as slow as you can make it.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I apologise.

The question about should we move beyond the individual components of what were termed, in Covid, NPIs, non-pharmaceutical interventions, rather a clumsy term, essentially meaning social measures, many of which are long-standing, quarantine, individual isolation, closing schools, many of these go back to the Middle Ages or beyond, these are not new ideas. However, the very big new idea was the idea of a lockdown. This is often -- all the NPIs are sometimes called lockdown by some commentators, but I'm talking here very, very specifically about the state saying people have to go home and stay at home except under very limited circumstances. A very radical thing to do.

**Lead Inquiry**: Mandatory quarantine?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Mandatory. Really big thing.

I would have thought it would be very surprising, without this being requested by a senior politician, or similar, that a scientific committee would venture, in between emergencies, into that kind of extraordinarily major social intervention, with huge economic and social ramifications.

So that's my point, is that it is very difficult for the committees to go beyond a certain level unless they are asked to do so externally.

**Lead Inquiry**: Of course Module 2 will return to the issue of the merits of mandatory quarantining, and I emphasise that's a very helpful introduction to the topic, but we really can't go further into that now.

Coming back to the central point that you make, which is that between emergencies because there is an absence of common aim, a common imperative to address all aspects of the instant emergency, there is a risk that all the various committees will fail to address sufficiently or think deeply enough about the possible ramifications or the consequences or the steps that have to be taken in relation to a prospective future emergency.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: That is --

**Lead Inquiry**: That is the point about mandatory quarantine?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: That is exactly right. If I could just add one important rider to that. The idea that the UK alone is thinking about this of course is incorrect. This is an international scientific effort and the situation we found ourselves going into Covid, the UK was in the middle, in my view, of the mainstream of world scientific opinion, so it wasn't that we were, on our own, isolated in a particular position, we had a position that was identical to virtually all other nations I'm aware of.

**Lead Inquiry**: We'll return to this issue later, but you are aware, of course, of -- although it was before your time as CMO -- Exercise Alice, which was the MERS-related exercise. My Lady has heard evidence that amongst the many recommendations and learnings from Exercise Alice were actions relating to the development of a MERS coronavirus, a MERS-CoV serology assay procedure for scaling up capacity, the production of a briefing paper on the South Korean outbreak concerning MERS with details of how to deal with port of entry screening, option plans for using evidence and cost-benefits for quarantine versus self-isolation, so mandatory quarantining/lockdowns versus self-isolation, and the development of plans for community sampling and also for mass contact tracing.

So all those issues to which you've referred, Sir Christopher, were all potential ramifications or consequences of a future prospective emergency as at 2016, but they were all flagged up in one way or another -- admittedly not in the highest profile way -- in 2016 as a result of Exercise Alice.

So why were they not taken further within or perhaps outwith the various committees which were constantly sitting to consider such issues?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So I thought the report on Exercise Alice and the exercise itself actually were very good and very useful. I don't think -- and I also think that it was sensible to do all of the recommendations that were put into it. So I thought they were all sensible. But actually they were incremental re-statements of existing thought. In fact, they weren't a new approach, they were essentially a bringing together and saying we've got to be more systematic about something we were already thinking about, aiming at the kinds of things that were seen with MERS and SARS, which were relatively modest size scale outbreaks compared to Covid, but still very significant infectious outbreaks. So Operation Alice was aimed at that problem, it wasn't aimed at a pandemic problem. I think the other very good report that goes alongside it is Dame Deirdre Hine's report after the pan flu -- sorry, the H1N1 2009 flu pandemic. That also has a number of very sensible recommendations.

Both of those I think would have helped us, but I don't think either of those would have led to the completely different approach to a pandemic which developed during the first few weeks of Covid.

**Lead Inquiry**: MERS is, as it says on the tin, a coronavirus. There was undoubtedly debate about these important steps, important plans, important policies. Were they not -- let me start again.

If they were not pursued further or at least to full fruition and put into place by way of planning for a pandemic, was that because it wasn't sufficiently recognised that a high-consequence infectious disease, perhaps a viral disease, could have the necessary characteristics and variables that would make it into a full-blown pandemic like an influenza pandemic, or because, administratively, the processes and the workstreams were simply not pursued sufficiently by the government, or both?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I wasn't involved in any of the decisions around this, I think I simply just can't answer that in a useful way.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

You've given evidence about the need for diversity and radicalism and challenge in relation to the standing committee and group structures, but we deliberately don't come on to SAGE, the response body.

Without going too far into the issue, because it is for Module 2, but to close off this matter, is there an issue about the diversity of composition of contribution in SAGE in the context of a health emergency? So, to be blunt, is there an issue -- which I'm not asking you to resolve today -- for future consideration about whether or not the outstanding experts, professionals and scientists who were on the committee were sufficiently diverse themselves, perhaps too weighted towards biomedical expertise as opposed to economic and social?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Well, I think that wraps up several quite important issues. Can I take it as two different chunks?

**Lead Inquiry**: Please.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: The first is the issue about: was there enough diversity in the group? I mean, you know, if you ask that in an objective way, the answer, to almost any group, will be no. But in terms of what is manageable, given that you have to have a committee that covers as much of the ground as possible and has to move very fast -- so just in Covid, we often had to have a meeting that finished half an hour before the COBR meeting or an equivalent, so you have to be able to do things quickly -- there is -- my view is it is a reasonable balance between coherence and challenge.

However, there is undoubtedly a lot of benefit from getting external challenge. So the challenge doesn't all have to be within the committee. I think there would be strong arguments for having mechanisms for actually essentially putting an antithesis to the thesis that's put forward by a body like SAGE. People talk about red teams, whatever, there are lots of ways of describing it, but the principles, I think, are perfectly reasonable, actually. But I think that may be a more efficient way to do it than to try and have every single aspect of every opinion represented in the one committee. I think that would be tricky.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that, to take it from another angle, because some or all of you are, as described I think by your colleague Sir Patrick Vallance, licensed dissidents? It is in the nature of being an expert, and of being particularly a scientific expert, that there is a tendency to challenge orthodoxy, it's part of the nature of the job you perform?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think that some scientists overemphasise their own unorthodoxy. There is a scientific orthodoxy at any point, and in fact the job of SAGE, and I think this is something which I'm sure will be very central to our discussions in the next module, is not, in my view, to provide radical ideas, it is to say this is the central position of science in the world at this moment in time, accepting the science may move on. So it's not actually designed to be a radical body as such, it's designed to be an expert body. Those two are not necessarily contradictory, but they -- certainly the aim of it is to provide a central view.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So --

**Lead Inquiry**: You had a second part --

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes, so the second part is you asked very specifically on economics, and I think this is a very important question. The problem you've got is that the people around SAGE tables are not best placed to provide challenge to one another or to an economist coming in. If you had two economists on SAGE, you would not be in a situation where SAGE would suddenly become an economically extraordinarily competent body. It would be a competent scientific body with two economists on it. Which does not strike me as actually answering any terrible useful question.

The very, very narrow bit where I think that SAGE in the health emergencies can have a role is in health economics, which is a very specific bit of microeconomics which is generally in medical schools, and alongside them rather than to one side. Doctors know how to understand health economics, but that's -- the big macroeconomic questions, the fiscal questions which were central to the debates not just in Covid but in most other emergencies I've seen, that requires a completely different skill set, and I don't think SAGE people, including myself, have the competence to assure government that they've considered the economic problem and they can now give a central view on it. I think that would have to be done separately.

**Lead Inquiry**: May I say thank you very much, because that is obviously of great assistance in terms of alerting us to some of the issues which will need to be explored in greater detail in module 2 in the context of the actual response by SAGE to the particular emergency.

Can I then come on to the issue of planning assumptions and the issue of the 2011 pandemic influenza strategy -- of course, again, before your time as CMO -- and some of the doctrinal thinking which has been open to criticism by a number of witnesses, both in writing and orally before the Inquiry.

The 2011 United Kingdom Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy, you yourself say in your witness statement that in November 2018 it was recognised that there was a need to refresh that strategy and the work was to be led by the DHSC with oversight from the Chief Medical Officer and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer. But the work on the update ceased in March 2019 as a result of reasons with which the Inquiry is now very familiar, namely the reallocation of necessary resources or the necessary reallocation of resources towards EU exit preparations.

To what extent was it recognised generally, either in the Office of the Chief Medical Officer, although that was before your time, so perhaps in the Office of the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, and the DHSC or the Cabinet Office, that there was a need to refresh the strategy, that it was a single strategy dealing with pandemic influenza and it was by then self-evidently a little out of date, and there was no other strategy for non-influenza pandemic in existence?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So I'm going to just go into one bit of Sir Humphrey-like language differential. In government, "refresh" generally means update but it doesn't mean any major shift. When you read this document now, with the benefit of having been through the thought processes that unfortunately we've had to be faced with during Covid, it clearly needs a complete re-think. It doesn't need just a refresh. Had there been a refresh, to use that term, which is not one I particularly like but I'm just using the term that was used, it would not, in my view, have significantly changed of its philosophical approach. It might have updated some bits around legislation and bodies and so on, but it would not, I think, have been materially different to what it is now, and I think what it needs is a re-think and I also think alongside it, and I've discussed this with colleagues already, I've said we need to do this, there needs to be a separate equivalent thing for non-influenza pandemic, so I think essentially there need to be two documents.

**Lead Inquiry**: That's a point, of course, which has been put to those who actually are responsible for the drafting of the strategy within the DHSC and the Cabinet Office.

On the first point that you make, Sir Christopher, does it follow that even had the refresh been -- and again I baulk at using the word -- carried through, it wouldn't have led to a significant difference in the United Kingdom's ability to prepare for the pandemic that in fact ensued, because it wouldn't have led to the necessary radical change of thinking that would have had a practical impact on our preparedness arrangements?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: That is my view.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

Can we come, then, to the doctrinal flaw to which you've just referred in that strategy, the one that might not have been picked up in any event, even had there been a refresh.

Would you agree with the following propositions: firstly, that there was in that strategy and generally across government a long-standing bias in behaviour of influenza?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So I -- that statement is true for good reason. I don't think that means that other things were not considered. The reason for this is simply that we've had many more influenza pandemics, anyone who was born after 1950 will have lived through three of them, and therefore we do have to think about influenza separately. I do actually think that is -- in terms of predictable risks, it's the biggest single predictable risk. But what most people think is the most likely thing is something we have not predicted, what WHO calls Disease X. And it's thinking around the ability to respond to the unexpected, the unpredicted, that I think that the separate strand of thinking needs to occur.

**Lead Inquiry**: I think the phrase comes from your predecessor, Professor Dame Sally Davies, that there is a long-standing bias. Bias is a state of fact or is a state of affairs. It may well be that there was good reason for that state of affairs insofar as the policy and the guidance and the strategy correctly recognised other risks, it just happened to determine that they were of lesser probability or lesser likelihood, and therefore they received less attention. But there was, was there not, administratively, a general taking of the eye off the ball in terms of focusing on those other risks, less probable, less likely, as they were, and a general trend towards focusing on influenza, disproportionately to the -- with the consequence that other areas, other risks, other matters, were not sufficiently catered for?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think I would differentiate here between having documents and having thinking. If you think about NERVTAG, which you've already talked about, NERVTAG was explicitly designed to cover non-influenza risks. Certainly my own thinking is not in any way limited to influenza. I think I submitted as evidence a talk I gave in Gresham College in 2018 just to prove it was not a post hoc rationalisation, there have been a number of those, and to make the point that most of what I was talking about was not influenza.

So I don't think it would be correct to say that no one was thinking about anything other than influenza. There were only documents about influenza. That's slightly different. And in reality, when I looked at this document at the beginning of the Covid pandemic, I did not feel the document gave me much that was of any great use. So the document and the thinking are, in reality, separate things.

**Lead Inquiry**: The question was predicated in fact on this aspect, that was there a tendency administratively to become overly focused on influenza, so in fact it wasn't designed to elicit the answer that there was a bias in terms of your or the expert thinking in this area, but the system and preparedness as a system began to display a long-standing bias, as Professor Dame Sally Davies says in favour of influenza?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think that is true, but I think this goes back to a general point which I think has been made by a lot of witnesses, that because every pandemic is very different and sometimes massively different from its predecessors, having plans and documents of this sort is actually not generally the most useful way to deal with it. What you need to have is capabilities and flexible capabilities which are backed up by resource sufficient to be able to scale them up. I think in a sense the danger in government is that people feel the document is written and therefore the problem is solved. I absolutely do not think that's the case. I think it's to do with: do you have a range of capabilities properly resourced with people who know how to operate them and have the mandate to do so?

**Lead Inquiry**: That brings me on to the doctrinal issues -- well, the flaws, strategic flaws 2 and 3.

In the plans, but most notably the risk assessment procedures and policies, was there, in your view, a failure to appreciate properly, firstly, that because of the variables inherent in any respiratory viral disease outbreak, such as levels of transmission, high, or stuttering, or transmission rate, whether short or long incubation periods, whether or not the virus would be asymptomatic or not, there was a failure to appreciate the risk sufficiently of a less likely but no less catastrophic pathogenic outbreak? The plans simply didn't openly address such issues, transmission, incubation period, symptomatic infection.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I don't think it was -- essentially my view is there are two separate issues that were missing. The first, in a way, the one that I think we really absolutely should have done, taken much more seriously, was the capability to scale up. That is useful in virtually everything. The ability -- you know, every pandemic, every epidemic, the ability to diagnose, for example, is essential, and we had a very good capacity to do a very small amount of diagnosis really quickly and we did not have the ability to scale up, and I could repeat that across multiple other domains.

**Lead Inquiry**: I'm going to bring you back, most importantly, to this issue of scaling up and capability?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Okay, fine, but just to lodge that I think that is very important. Then I think there was a strong intellectual appreciation that you could have multiple other conditions, and if you'd asked any of the excellent public health experts in UKHSA and PHE, as it then was, what are all the different things that could happen, most of them would have said there's a very wide range.

What we didn't then do is go down to say: okay, well, what are the building blocks you're going to need for different sorts of pandemic, with different variable levels of both route of transmission and mortality in particular?

If I can illustrate that, and I am going to use lockdown, because I think it is so central to the thinking of lots of people who are thinking about this Inquiry, if you look back over the last several pandemics you certainly wouldn't have used it in H1N1 in 2009, because it was not a large enough impact on society in any way to justify it --

**Lead Inquiry**: Well, you have just made plain, because it was a mild influenza pandemic?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Correct. Then, going back to the next one, HIV, a very serious thing, you would never have used it, because it would have not worked at all. That whole route of transmission was different. It wouldn't have worked against plague, it wouldn't have worked against cholera. It might have worked against the H1N1 1918 pandemic possibly, and that might have therefore been justified.

But I'm just making the point that actually you have to be extremely adaptable to the problem you deal with, but you also have to say, well, if you go to the top range of mortality, how can we actually get that down and is society prepared to pay the price to get that down. I think that was, in a sense, the leap of imagination, not just the UK but just internationally I think we had not fully made, because the UK position was identical to almost all of our neighbours, to the WHO and so on, it wasn't a uniquely UK position.

**Lead Inquiry**: But, Sir Christopher, your answer, of course, refers quite understandably to capability, to the need to scale up and of course to that foundational doctrinal observation which is that any plan for a pandemic must be able to cater flexibly for unexpected consequences or unexpected pandemics, and obviously mandatory quarantining doesn't always work, it all depends on the nature of transmission of the pathogenic outbreak.

But my questions were designed to ask you about whether or not there was a failure in the planning, in the risk assessment process, the actual systems that we have in place in this country to deal with a pandemic, the planning, the EPRR structures. There was no open or extensive consideration of these issues, about transmission and the variable -- inherently variable aspects of a pandemic or -- asymptomatic infection or high transmission rates turning a high-consequence infectious disease into a full blown global pandemic, they're just not apparent on the face of all this planning documentation.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I think this illustrates a failure in the way we generally operate in government to deal with emergencies, which is to say we need to have a plan for every eventuality and if you can just pull off the plan, you can tick off all the things you've got to do, that's going to work. Problem is -- and pandemics is just one example, but a very, very extreme one, Covid demonstrated this -- actually what nature is going to give you, to talk about the hazards -- and threats are different, hazards -- is going to be completely different every time.

So what you need to have is the building blocks of lots of different capabilities and you need to say, "Actually, we don't know what problem we're going to face, but what we do know is we've got the capabilities to face a whole range of different possible outcomes". I think it's this -- the system design is designed to focus in on a plan based around a scenario rather than to, say, multiple capabilities that can be flexed to almost any emergency in biological or a geophysical or whatever space.

**Lead Inquiry**: But, thirdly, there does now need to be, and there is now, a consideration of multiple scenarios in a way which there wasn't formerly in all this planning material following the Royal Academy of Engineering review in particular, which with which you're familiar, which specifically recommended that for each risk a range of scenarios should be generated to explore uncertainty, and possible additional planning requirements. So it's in essence the point you make: a proper plan must have within it the identification of a broader range of scenarios to alert the system that additional planning may be required and additional steps may need to be taken. That was the third strategic error, if you like, wasn't it?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes, in my view. Then I think I'd add to that a fourth, which is to expose really clearly to political leaders that there is a choice in terms of resource, and that: here is a one in 50-year event, do you wish to buy the insurance for that one in 50-year event, this is how much it's going to cost.

I think that is really central to this, because I think the danger is we respond to a threat, a new perceived threat with a new plan, but no new resource, and that very seldom tends to end in a good way.

**Lead Inquiry**: May we park resource at the end of the list. That's obviously a political issue.

Focusing -- continuing to focus on the system, is a fourth strategic error that -- and it's one that I know you know that Mr Hancock particularly has made reference in his witness evidence to this Inquiry, is that because the reasonable worst-case scenario approach focused on the worst that could realistically happen, and because everyone's minds were therefore focused on trying to deal with the worst that could realistically happen, insufficient thought was given to in, practice -- until obviously Covid was upon you -- trying to prevent the worst from happening at all?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I half agree with the distinguished previous Secretary of State. I'd certainly agree that we did not give sufficient thought to what we could do to stop in its tracks a pandemic on the scale of Covid or indeed any other pathogen that could realistically go there. I do think, on the other hand, it is sensible to have a plan for if everything fails what are we going to do. We do still need to be able to say, "Let's go to the top of the range, actually we could end up with 750,000 people dying, where are we going to bury bodies? Where are we going to ..."

These are important -- they may seem morbid but they are practically important planning things, and in this sense I do think a plan is important. But where I would completely agree is that we do need to actually start off, and I think this was brought out in Mr Hunt's evidence yesterday, and also Mr Letwin's, all of them essentially said: we saw this huge problem and we didn't say to the system, "Well, how are we going to stop it?"

And actually it is senior ministers who have the capacity to say to the system: actually, are you absolutely right we can't go any better than that? We need to actually address that.

So I think this is about the interaction between the political, "We've really got to do something serious here, I want to be absolutely assured we can't do any better", and the scientific and technical, "Okay, well, in response to that challenge, here is your range of options, but they are going to cost something", and you need to understand what that trade-off is and then you can -- and that I think is where we have not been successful.

**Lady Hallett**: Could we just pause, I'm afraid, Mr Keith. I think it may be that it's been --

**Mr Keith**: Too much.

**Lady Hallett**: -- quite a morning.

**Mr Keith**: I have out of the corner of my eye tried to keep an eye upon the travails of our wonderful stenographer.

**The Witness**: I apologise for my fast speaking.

**Lady Hallett**: Sir Chris, as a said to another witness, it's a tendency I have too, so I understand. It's very difficult to change your patterns of speech.

Can we break there?

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, may I just put one final thought to Sir Christopher?

**Lady Hallett**: Provided you speak slowly.

**Mr Keith**: I hope I speak a little slower.

Sir Christopher, you have then identified four broad, I would suggest, strategic errors or flaws in the system, none of these are personal, they are all of course to do with the way in which the system readied itself for a prospective pandemic. The fifth is a matter that you touched upon earlier and to which you made reference: was there a general strategic failure to learn from the experiences of certain East Asian countries who had dealt with SARS and MERS, and to learn from their responses to the particular characteristics of those coronaviral outbreaks, the learning to which you referred earlier of course relating to mass testing, mass contact tracing, mass self-isolation, and mandatory quarantine?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Well, I think certainly if we're talking about the pre-pandemic Covid period.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I certainly think that we should do more to learn from approaches which are not the standard European, North American, if I can simplify, approaches to things which tend to dominate a lot of our thinking. So I certainly think we should be communicating as much as we can with other countries, including in South East Asia and East Asia which have outstandingly good scientists, who often come at things with a very different perspective. However, some of the very specific learnings that people raise are, in my view, technically incorrect. I don't want to go through them in great detail, but for example, you know, I've spoken to my colleagues in South Korea about MERS. Their principal problem was an issue of hospital transmission, that's where most of the transmission -- well, the large part of the transmission -- force of transmission came from. What that did though is it made them think they had simply under-invested in, both intellectually and financially, public health, and they did so. They completely changed the way -- they were much more systematic. The same was true in Canada, for example, after

**Sars**: exactly the same issue, a lot of the transmission was in hospitals, the numbers were small but the impact was very substantial, they changed what they did and they re-thought their whole approach and they reinvested in public health. That is a very, very generic learning. It wasn't the "This is a coronavirus and therefore we can learn from a coronavirus". I think -- for a variety of reasons I don't think it's -- probably this is the right place to go into, it's a very, very long chain of logic but it is -- I'm reasonably solid about it -- I think that it was much more the generic "We need to strengthen public health responses to infections and take them very seriously at the earliest possible stage and scale", rather than "These particular learnings we took away from this particular virus".

**Lead Inquiry**: So the generic, the systemic improvements rather than specific countermeasures, for example?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes, there are some exceptions, but broadly that is my view.

**Mr Keith**: All right.

My Lady, may we leave it there?

**Lady Hallett**: Certainly. Quarter to, please.

*(12.46 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(1.45 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: I'm sorry if there was some confusion about whether I was taking a short break or lunch.

**Mr Keith**: My Lady.

Professor, may we turn, please, now to the issue of maintaining capability.

In your witness statement, you make these points: that as soon as the danger of a pandemic or an epidemic has passed, it's in the nature of things that countries start to dismantle whatever capacity they put into place, probably at great speed and under extreme pressure, and you make the further point that it's simply not possible for any reasonable or proper system to maintain a full standing capacity to deal with a pandemic or prospective pandemic. But also that the risk of a future pandemic is an enduring one, it doesn't go away.

So you make the concluding point that, in order to respond in a measured, reasonable, proportionate way to future challenges, there has to be the maintenance of some basic capability that must be scaled up in an emergency.

How is that line to be drawn? Where does one draw the line in terms of what those basic capacities are? How can any government have a clear understanding of what capacities it must keep by way of a minimum standing ability?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Well, I think that there are, firstly, a group of technical capacities that we have to keep at a potentially quite low level, but we need to have them. So, for example, we must have people who are what's called entomologists, who look at insect and other vector-borne diseases for humans. They happen rarely, except for things like Lyme, which happen not as an epidemic, but we need to have that capacity because were we to have such an outbreak in the UK, we need to be able to respond to it.

So there are specific skills we need to maintain across a whole range of the disciplines.

Then we need to have the ability to scale up in the predictable areas, which would include things I've mentioned already, like diagnostic skills, it might include PPE, protective equipment, and a variety of other areas.

It's this scaling up which, in my view, was the weakness that was demonstrated during the early phase in Covid, and I laid out a kind of five-stage -- in the witness statement, I'm not going to go through it in full, a five-stage process, but the first three stages were an initial technical response to the small number of early cases, which I think was done well and I think the UK is well set up for, then a scale-up phase, and then the point where the full capacity of the state is in play, which is a political decision essentially.

But that scale-up between them needs to be possible and that requires investment. Now, how much investment is a political question, but I think what we need to do is put to political leaders, who absolutely have to make this decision: what is the level of risk that you think we should be insuring for? And this should be explicit.

I think we've not necessarily always done that, and said to our political leaders, who speak for society and must have the last word: this much additional risk mitigation, held in some form of another, will reduce the risk of a future pandemic or other emergency, but it will cost this much and do you essentially wish to take that insurance?

That I think we have not done and I think we need to be a lot more explicit about this.

**Lead Inquiry**: In effect, the choice for future politicians or current or future politicians for society and the public must be plainly identified so that that choice is available to be exercised?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Exactly. It may be exercised through holding dual use facilities, maybe by holding contracts with private sector, a variety of ways it could be done, but it will have some implications and that resource will have to come from somewhere else.

**Lead Inquiry**: Of course.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So there will be a choice for people between having an insurance against future events and, for example, investing in immediate emergencies, pressures in the NHS during winter and so on. That is a choice and I think it has to be made explicit.

**Lead Inquiry**: The first of the two areas of which you have spoken, the technical disciplines, is it in fact the position that in this country we were blessed and remain blessed by the major scientific capacity, particularly in the area of infectious diseases, which exists? So in terms of the acknowledged experts in the field, the strong academic centres, the expertise in government, the technical capacity in Public Health England and the NHS, now UKHSA, and the basic applied research, our scientific structures were, as these things go, relatively strong?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes, I think -- I don't think that's a kind of jingoistic position. I think most international observers would say the UK scientific response, particularly on research but in other areas as well was very strongly by international standards. There are other areas people might be more critical of, but that, I think, is seen to be not perfect by any means but certainly strong by international standards. And it is essential that we keep that, to be clear.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was that evident at the time of the pandemic, or at least on the advent of the pandemic, by the speed with which diagnostic testing was able to be developed, by the various studies and the scientific work which was put into place, the SIREN study, the Vivaldi study in relation to care homes, the Covid-19 infection survey, the recovery trials in relation to dexamethasone and so on; on the scientific side of the response to the pandemic, the United Kingdom was in a relatively good position?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes, that's my judgment and I don't think that's a particularly controversial judgment.

**Lead Inquiry**: So the issue, then, for this Inquiry is the scaling up, the operational and necessarily the political decision-making which has to underpin it for the future?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Exactly.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

Is it important, therefore, to state openly that, as a system, the country must maintain a strong and established clinical public health and biomedical research base so that in the event of the next pandemic that scientific support will continue to be available?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: That is absolutely my view, and I think people exaggerate the degree to which we can predict what the next threat will be, and therefore we need to have an ability to make a full spectrum response to a whole variety of different effects.

**Lead Inquiry**: That includes, therefore, scientific workforce, scientific research infrastructure, the flexibility, through studies, through proper scientific resource and so on, to be able to respond to the next pandemic?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Exactly.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

Now, finally, just two aspects of your technical report, please. You've covered many of the areas in the course of your evidence, and I'm sure you -- well, you've referred to your technical report already. I want to address two threads in the report.

One, firstly, why is data and the provision of data so important to preparedness?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: If you think about the decisions that were being taken both early in the pandemic and subsequently, all of them rested on having fast and reliable data, and if you don't have that data and you don't have it from around the country with a representative group of the population, you're essentially driving in the dark, it's very, very difficult to work out what the right decisions are. As I'm sure we will come on to in the next module, this caused us some significant problems in the first part of the response.

It also -- the more data you have, the more exact your decisions can be, the nearer, in a sense, to what's the optimal outcome, because you're always trading off different very significant risks between things, political leaders need to be given data, and you can also on that base research studies on which you can then devise the countermeasures, the medical countermeasures which will be the way out of the pandemic in the end.

One of the key themes of the technical report and, indeed, a lot of what I've said elsewhere is that you move from societal interventions, which are by definition crude and damaging, but they're all you have initially, because you don't have drugs, you don't have vaccines, you don't have diagnostics, and so on, you move over to a medical intervention, but that depends on research, and research depends on data. So they are linked together.

**Lead Inquiry**: As you observe, the Inquiry in Module 2 will be looking, of course, at the provision of data that was in place on the eve of the pandemic, and what was available to decision-makers when they responded particularly in February and March of 2020.

But the point goes beyond that. There had plainly been changes in the supply and provision of data in the United Kingdom. Undoubtedly government processes for the assembly of data have changed and improved as a result of the pandemic.

Is therefore the point to be taken that it is vital to ensure that those systems do not degrade in the future, that the higher levels at which data provision is being maintained now must be continued?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So I think there are two elements to that. I completely agree with the basis of the question. The first is a technical one: do we actually have the ability to collect the data and then to knit it together from different directions to make an overall picture? That's absolutely essential. That's largely a resource and skillset question.

Then it is very important that we take the general public with us, whose data this is at the end of the day, to make sure that they feel comfortable that the way that we've brought data together to support decisions, to support medical science, is in line with what they would be expecting from their own data. I think those two have to be kept in balance.

But occasionally I think we have allowed ourselves to get overly concerned with the risks of this and therefore not make -- not actually bring together data that would be hugely in the public interest to bring together, both to allow us to provide services now and to provide science that will improve public health and medicine in the future.

**Lead Inquiry**: A second, perhaps even more important, aspect of your technical report, because it comes in chapter 2, is the issue of disparities. Why are disparities in health relevant to the issue of preparedness?

The evidence, Sir Christopher, shows that the government systems on preparedness and the policy and the guidance and the structures paid absolutely no regard to disparities in health other than insofar as it was an obvious reflection of the fact that, clinically, some sectors of the population, because of comorbidities, would be worse off in the event of a pandemic.

Your report focuses to a very large extent on the need to ensure that disparities in health and in society are addressed. Why must they be addressed in the context of preparedness?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: One of the things that is striking and repeated in every pandemic and epidemic is that people living in areas of disparity suffer most from them. The reasons for that, however, vary. So, you know, the reasons that people in cholera epidemics died in higher numbers is because of the provision of poor water. The reason that people in some of the respiratory pandemics of history died was because they were in crowded housing conditions. And so on.

I'm making that point because you both need to think about disparity as a whole, but you also need to think about what the causal pathway is for each route of transmission and for each pandemic as it goes through.

But I think there is one final point I would like to make, which is the best way you can deal with reducing the risk of a pandemic to people living in areas of disparity or living with particular risks is to get on top of the pandemic. Essentially that is the most sure way of doing so, and I think we have to always remember that that's the central plank on which everything else is based.

**Lead Inquiry**: Finally, in a particularly self-deprecating manner, Sir Oliver Letwin stated in evidence that politicians were in some significant regards amateurs, and that there was a case for training of ministers and officials in crisis management. Is there anything that you would like to say on that topic?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I would absolutely not want to venture to suggest any particular training for our political leaders. I think much of what they bring is the ability to ask questions, which, in a sense, people bring because they're new to a field. I think one of the dangers in all areas of expertise is you become snow-blind, you don't realise the obvious question, and actually having political leaders who come in from outside is one of the ways in which they can produce radicalism. I think Sir Oliver, sparing his blushes because he's not here, was a very good example of that. He did, in my view, a superb job, for example, during the West African Ebola crisis in knitting things together, absolutely picked up on all the issues.

I think, however, what is helpful is for people to realise the range of capabilities they have at their disposal, and therefore whilst I -- you know, whilst that's entirely optional for certainly political leaders, that's their choice, I do think within government there's sometimes a lack of understanding of science between emergencies.

This goes back to this between emergencies and in an emergency. In an emergency everybody is clamouring for science advice. I've seen this in every emergency I've ever seen. They are desperate to get the scientists in the room. Between emergencies you have to kind of elbow your way in. So it's the ability to actually engage all the way through the system between emergencies, that I think is the big risk.

People can pick things up very quickly when they need to. A very large proportion of the British population now know a lot more epidemiology than many doctors probably did three years ago. So, you know, people can pick stuff up very quickly when they need to. What I think they need to do is think about the range of issues between emergencies which may, in due course, lead us into problems.

**Lead Inquiry**: Between emergencies, Sir Christopher, you are sadly prophets in your own land.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I wouldn't go that far.

**Mr Keith**: Thank you very much.

My Lady, there are a number of questions under Rule 10 from Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Group.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Ms Munroe.

Questions From Ms Munroe KC

**Ms Munroe**: Thank you, my Lady.

Good afternoon, Sir Christopher. My name is Allison Munroe and I ask questions this afternoon on behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice. The questions arise out of a guidance document that you may or may not be familiar with.

Sir Mark Walport provided the Inquiry with a draft guidance for SAGE on emerging infections, diseases, which was produced between 2013 and 2017.

Perhaps if we could bring that guidance up, please.

It's INQ000142139. Thank you.

If we go to page 2, we can see there the contents of the document, and then at page 3 -- thank you -- at page 3, the purpose.

So:

"This document is intended to assist the Government Chief Scientific Adviser and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) to provide timely, relevant scientific advice to the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBR) in the event of an emergency involving a non-influenza emerging or unidentified infectious disease which might affect the UK."

Now, I don't need to take you through the rest of that document for the purposes of the questions, but suffice to say, Sir Christopher, within that document there are definitions of risk, definitions of emergent infectious diseases and, at pages, for reference, 6, 7 and 8, the guidance sets out issues in terms of the impact or potential impact of emerging diseases on public or on civil society and on the economy.

First question, Sir Christopher -- a rather long introduction -- did you know about this guidance at the time that we're concerned with in this Inquiry?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I didn't recall this guidance during the short period between becoming CMO and the outbreak of the pandemic, but I suspect I may well have contributed in a very -- in several previous iterations in my role to the development of this draft guidance. I recognise kind of phrases I probably would have put into it. So I think I am aware broadly, but it's a while since I've seen anything like this, and it's not -- I certainly hadn't seen the final version. In fact I'm not sure there has been a final version of this.

**Ms Munroe KC**: Yes, because the authorship and the date of the document, I've said, between 2013 and 2017, so, as you said, there are a number of different versions of it, perhaps, iterations of it?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: There were two sorts of document, if I can just clarify.

**Ms Munroe KC**: Please.

**Professor Sir Whitty**: There were documents like this, which were to help guide the SAGE process and make it rapidly respond to a problem, and then when I was an interim -- just interim Government Chief Scientific Adviser between Sir Mark Walport, who you heard from yesterday, and Sir Patrick Vallance, who you will hear from subsequently, I helped to add to that something we call golden hour documents, which were documents which allowed someone to deal with the bones of a problem even before SAGE had met, where you actually look at the key issues scientifically so you can actually inform discussions with ministers.

**Ms Munroe KC**: Yes, because in the guidance, and again we don't need to take you to the document or have it up on the screen, but pages 8, 9 and 10 set out a series of questions for COBR and certain responses or advice that could and should be given.

Are you able to tell us, then, Sir Christopher, in terms of this particular guidance, how would it have been used by yourself and what considerations to this guidance would you have given, particularly in terms of informing any pandemic planning and educating frontline workers in health or social care, for example?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So this document, to be clear, had a pretty narrow specific purpose and this was to help guide the set-up for a SAGE were there to be an emergency in this situation. So it was not designed for frontline workers. It wasn't, in fact, designed to have a wider utility. This kind of document was, very narrowly, to help the Government Office for Science to have the most focused and effective first few SAGE meetings.

This would be particularly important if the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, for example, was working in an area outside his or her own area of expertise. I think the more they're in their area of expertise, the more they would have felt comfortable, in a sense, setting the agenda themselves.

**Ms Munroe KC**: But as a guidance document, as its name suggests, it provides you with some advice and perhaps almost a starting point for further discussion and further thinking?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Exactly, it's designed as guidance, but guidance to guide the SAGE meeting, not guidance for the wider generality.

**Ms Munroe KC**: You've mentioned the golden hour documents. Again, turning back to Sir Mark Walport, who said of this draft guidance that it morphed into the current set of golden hour documents used by GO-Science.

Firstly, can you just explain what that is, when you talk about it and when Sir Mark talks about the golden hour documents?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So the slightly clumsy phrasing actually, unfortunately, is from me, because it comes from sort of classic medical emergency procedures, where you say there is a golden hour in which you can intervene very rapidly and in that time you can have a very big impact. The lacuna, the gap that I perceived and others perceived was there was a period between the point an emergency arose and a point a SAGE had met, when a Government Chief Scientific Adviser, departmental Chief Scientific Adviser, CMO or whatever, would be asked legitimate and important questions by political leaders and others, to which they would have to give answers at that time, but in advance of the SAGE.

So the idea of it was to give basically a kind of crash course in a subject, let us say a major earthquake, so that someone could actually go to their first meetings with some degree of confidence that they had the various areas covered.

**Ms Munroe KC**: Thank you.

In addition, how were these golden hour documents used within your specific role as Chief Medical Officer? Is there anything else that you want to say about that and how you would use it?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: No, except I think to pay tribute to the SAGE secretariat from GO-Science who not only managed the SAGE meetings, but essentially provided the horizon scanning and the apparatus that underpins what the Government Chief Scientific Adviser can do in an emergency, particularly in the earliest stages.

**Ms Munroe KC**: Thank you.

Sir Christopher, my next question is about emerging infectious diseases. Am I right in saying that high-consequence infectious diseases fall within the emerging infectious disease category on the National Risk Register? So, for example, Ebola, SARS, MERS, avian flu are all examples of high-consequence infectious diseases, HCIDs?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Some high-consequence infectious diseases are emerging diseases, a few are not, and many emerging diseases are not high-consequence infectious diseases, so they're not synonymous, but there is a lot of overlap in some of the more severe ones like the ones you mention.

**Ms Munroe KC**: So my question is this, Sir Christopher, in the guidance, and this is at page 5, it says that an emerging infectious disease could potentially become pandemic, and that must be correct, mustn't it?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Very rarely.

**Ms Munroe KC**: Very rarely. The author then goes on, or authors rather go on at page 6 of the guidance to outline, firstly, the most likely scenario and then the reasonable worst-case scenario.

If we could perhaps have the document back up and go to page 6 to look at what's actually said there.

*(Pause)*

**Ms Munroe KC**: So just looking at that box at the top of page 6, Sir Christopher, are you familiar with what's written there?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: I am.

**Ms Munroe KC**: Yes. So they're starting -- again, it's a starting point for thinking and discussion in this document, looking at scenarios and what potential action could potentially be taken, and also looking at behavioural aspects as well.

So you would accept, would you not, that in relation to emerging infectious diseases such as SARS, or a SARS-like disease, that was the "most likely scenario"?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Within the narrow, narrowish definition of emerging infectious diseases that were important enough that they could have an impact on UK. That's a lot of caveats. Because -- but in that environment, something like SARS would be a very good example. But if I can -- just to explain why I've made that distinction, another emerging infectious disease of very considerable significance was Zika virus. We considered this roughly over this time period. We thought this was a very serious emerging infectious disease but because the mosquito species that could pass this on are not able to maintain themselves for long periods in the UK, at least at this point in time, we thought this was a significant risk globally, in this particular case in Brazil, and this was in an Olympic year, but it was not a significant risk in the UK, nor was it likely to become so.

It is quite important when you look at a risk or a hazard that you make a judgment: is this a risk or a hazard in one place or is this a risk or a hazard that's likely to come to the UK? This was an example where actually the risk or -- the risk in this case was not likely to come to the UK and we made an important professional judgment we did not need to go beyond a certain point in our planning on this because that would have been inappropriate given the relatively low risk, in fact almost zero risk, of a significant epidemic of this infection in the UK.

**Ms Munroe KC**: Well, my final question is about where the emphasis lay in UK planning. And just to put this in context, with HCIDs there would need to be, in terms of the response, an enhanced response?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: There needs to be quite a specific response which notice -- is based on the fact that these infections can have a very significant mortality if someone catches them, in terms of high numbers.

**Ms Munroe KC**: In your evidence earlier this afternoon, it was just after 12.30, I think, you were discussing the long-standing bias for pandemic flu planning, and you said:

"I think that's true, having documents and plans are separate things, you need to have capabilities backed up by resources with capabilities to scale up."

Now, with HCIDs, and I think this again, hopefully you'll agree with this, in terms of :outline:`airborne` HCIDs and responding to them, there have been some exercises such as an Ebola exercise, wasn't there?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: Yes, I mean, Ebola, just to be clear, is actually a touch-based disease, it's not :outline:`airborne` or respiratory by route. That's an important point. So were I sitting next to someone who had Ebola, I would be much less concerned than if it was an :outline:`airborne` or respiratory infection.

**Ms Munroe KC**: Well, as an HCID --

**Professor Sir Whitty**: It is an HCID, yes.

**Ms Munroe KC**: So there was an Ebola preparedness surge capacity exercise, wasn't there?

**Professor Sir Whitty**: If you tell me so, I'm sure that is true. I can't recall it but I'm sure that is true.

**Ms Munroe KC**: Again, we don't need to bring it up, but for reference it is in the documents at INQ000090428.

The outcome of that surge capacity exercise for this HCID showed that there wasn't, in fact, capacity to surge, it was a small amount of five cases, which would result in the loss of 80 infectious beds. So even on a small scale, for HCIDs, it was going to be difficult, wasn't it, to scale up and --

**Professor Sir Whitty**: So the way that I would conceptualise this, if I may, is that you have two extremely specialist centres in the UK, one in London, one in Newcastle, which can manage the most infectious and dangerous cases, including diseases we may never have come across before. Around that there is a larger group of centres that are specialist in HCIDs which are, in a sense, still dealing with very high risk infections but are a slightly lower level of risk. But if you ran out of beds with the first two, then you would move into the next area round. Then around that are a group of specialist infectious disease -- what's called negative pressure rooms, where the air is sucked into the room, and that's a much larger number but these are still specialist beds. Then around that is side rooms which are not specialist or don't have the right equipment.

What you would do in an emergency is essentially you go out from the centre. If you had an HCID that was expanding in numbers, at a certain point you'd then move into what's called cohorting, where you take over an entire ward -- and we did this during Covid -- and you say everyone on this ward is going to have this disease and no one who hasn't got this disease goes on to this ward.

So there is a kind of -- there's a mechanism for scaling out. Each one of those is at a slightly lower level of expertise and at a slightly lower level of protection, potentially, maybe the first two are very high levels of expertise, but in all of those cases you always have to see there is an opportunity to scale. This is one of the things we have come back to repeatedly: you have to have plans to scale and you have to work out how you're going to do it.

**Lady Hallett**: We're going to have to leave it there, I am afraid, Ms Munroe, we've got an awful lot to get through this afternoon.

**Ms Munroe**: My Lady, yes, I think, in fact, Sir Christopher has answered my last question, about scaling out, yes.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

**Ms Munroe**: Thank you very much, my Lady.

Thank you, Sir Christopher.

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, that concludes the evidence of Sir Christopher Whitty.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Sir Christopher, extremely grateful for your help.

I was astonished and sorry to hear about the abuse of you and other colleagues. It's wrong for so many reasons, but I do know how distressing it can be, so I hope that people will think twice, but of course they never do, do they, before --

**The Witness**: Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: -- committing themselves to distressing acts unnecessarily. There are so many different ways to express different opinions, why do we have to have personal abuse?

**The Witness**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you so much.

**The Witness**: Thank you very much.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: Ms Blackwell.

**Ms Blackwell**: My Lady, may I call Sir Patrick Vallance, please.
