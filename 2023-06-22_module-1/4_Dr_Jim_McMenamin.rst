Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you.

Dr McMenamin, thank you for the assistance that you have given to the Inquiry so far. You've provided a witness statement, and I know that you are familiar with the corporate witness statement as well from Public Health Scotland, and thank you for coming to give your evidence to the Inquiry today.

Please keep your voice up, speak into the microphone so that the stenographer can hear you for the transcript. If you need a break at any time, just ask.

I'm going to begin by setting out your career history so far as it's relevant to the Inquiry.

You are a medical doctor with a master's in public health and honorary clinical senior lecturer at the School of Health & Wellbeing at the University of Glasgow.

You were appointed as a consultant epidemiologist to the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health in 2003.

You were then interim clinical director and strategic lead for the respiratory viral team within HPS, and you are now the head of Infections Service and the strategic incident director for Covid-19 at Public Health Scotland.

Is that all right?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Thank you, and one extra thing, that I was the chair for the three years of the National Incident Management Team in Scotland.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. For the three years involving Covid-19?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you very much.

Well, it's your evidence prior to that that we're interested in today in Module 1, and I'm going to begin, if I may, by using you to set out the history and structure of Scotland's public health bodies.

As you tell us in your statement, Dr McMenamin, Public Health Scotland works to protect and improve the health of people in Scotland and to reduce health inequalities. It became a legal entity on 7 December of 2019 and came into operation on 1 April 2020, and we'll come back to that in a moment. But that means that in relation to the time to which this module relates, the national leadership for protecting the Scottish public from infectious diseases and environmental hazards was the remit of Health Protection Scotland, or HPS, which was part of the NHS National Services Scotland; is that right?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes, that's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: HPS led on preparing for high-consequence infectious diseases, epidemics and pandemics, and National Services Scotland led on preparation for general civil emergencies and whole-system civil emergencies; is that right?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes, that's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

You explain in your witness statement that Public Health Scotland brought together three legacy bodies, Health Protection Scotland, Information Services Division, and NHS Health Scotland; so taking those three bodies in turn, if we may.

HPS can trace its history back to 1969 and the creation of the Communicable Diseases (Scotland) Unit, which was a specialist unit tasked with conducting surveillance of communicable infections; is that right?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, and the Communicable Diseases (Scotland) Unit then evolved, absorbing and expanding its remit to include helping protect the public from non-infectious environmental threats to health, and at one point the unit was renamed the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health, and it then became Health Protection Scotland in 2005.

That's a whistle-stop tour of the history of public health in Scotland.

But Health Protection Scotland was responsible for providing health information, together with the Information Services Division, and National Health Service Health Scotland was Scotland's national health improvement agency.

We have additional information about this in the Public Health Scotland corporate statement, my Lady, explaining that the work of National Health Scotland focused on what could be done to improve public health in Scotland and to reduce what was seen as unfair and avoidable health inequalities.

Is that work still very much in progress?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Certainly very much so, it's at the centre of everything that our organisation Public Health Scotland has been set up to address.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Public Health Scotland was created through the programme of public health reform that began, in 2015, with the public health review and, as we've already made mention, was delivered up to and including 2020 through the public health reform programme.

Are you able, please, Dr McMenamin, to explain why it was concluded that Public Health Scotland ought to be created and was created when that happened?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Thank you.

Over time there had certainly been a very significant number of infection challenges and information challenges in the community, from the perspective of inequalities. Earlier in proceedings we've heard testimony from experts on just what the impact has been of those inequalities.

The purposeful bringing together of the three organisations was to try and put inequalities at the centre of everything that we do, to improve healthy wellbeing in the population, and that that very purposeful attempt then was to bring together the relative strengths of each of those organisations to try and assist in that process. If you like, to have some synergy between each of those to make sure that nothing was falling between the stones.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So do you see there being a benefit of having a single unified public health agency?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Very much so.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What about the timing of it, Dr McMenamin? Why was Public Health Scotland made operational in April of 2020, given as we know that that was really a month or two after the Covid-19 pandemic had hit?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: It's certainly unfortunate timing, but nonetheless something which had been well scheduled and was very supported by all of the territorial NHS boards and the other boards in Scotland and by Scottish Government, and also by COSLA, because this new organisation was to be one in which it was jointly sponsored by the chief officers of each of the local authorities and by Scottish Government. So this signalled approach where we were going to be coming into being became part of the legal framework in December 2019, and then we came into being on that April 2020.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: That was a smooth -- as smooth as we could make it -- transition where our NSS, National Services Scotland, colleagues assisted us all the way through and, as we became this new organisation, rather than the 100 or so people that we might have had at the start of this to try and deal with things, we now had access to more than 1,000 personnel to be able to help us in dealing with that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So in terms of the timing of it, it was something that had been in the planning for several years.

You mentioned COSLA, that's the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, isn't it? What was the rationale for and the effect of Public Health Scotland's accountability to both national and local government?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Well, this again was a new bit of innovative thinking where we were trying to ensure that no matter what we did it was to enable the health of the population at a local level, to be best assisted within the combined efforts of the new organisation.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right, thank you.

Some questions now about funding. You tell us in your witness statement that Public Health Scotland's opening budget and staffing levels were, in your view, not sufficient for the organisation to be able to deliver health protection in a response that was required when the pandemic hit.

Does that remain your view, and explain to us, please, Dr McMenamin, why you hold that view?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes. In this instance, the particular thrust that we had here was that we had to have a funding that was adequate, but flexible. How do we make sure that any ringfencing that we have didn't get in the way of what we needed to do within the new organisation? Now, I understand that financial rules and regulations are essential within our National Health Service organisation to make sure that we demonstrate value for money in everything that we do --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: -- but nonetheless it becomes important that we're able to have flexibility in how we can best utilise that funding available to us.

But there's one important caveat to that, that for that funding -- which was, you know, you will see from our statement submissions, was funding in a pre-pandemic setting -- was something which was felt to be adequate for a pandemic as we move into that, that flexibility that we then would like to have is something which becomes much, much more attractive to allow a speed of response.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Thank you.

May we have on screen, please, INQ000101052. This is a document that we can see from the bottom right-hand corner was created in December of 2006, and it's Health Protection Scotland's health protection framework for the response to an influenza pandemic in Scotland.

We can see from the first two paragraphs that this is indeed a document devoted to pandemic influenza rather than any other type of pandemic.

Dr McMenamin, why did this framework focus only on influenza as opposed to any other type of pandemic, and how, if you can explain to us, did that in any way hamper the situation?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: This document was produced before what has been called the swine flu pandemic of 2009.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, 2009, yes.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: It was, at the time, what we could say was the likeliest issue to come and challenge us. So from that perspective, it was very deliberately focused on a response to pandemic influenza in which we, on a UK basis, were working collaboratively to deal with that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

Let's look, please, if we can at page 7 of this document, and we can see that the aims of the health protection framework is to provide a tactical framework for health protection response, to put the health protection framework for the response to an influenza pandemic in Scotland in the context of the overarching national arrangements laid out in the UK health departments' influenza pandemic contingency plan, the Health Protection Agency pandemic influenza plan and the HPS emergency response plan.

Just pausing there, this of course pre-dated the United Kingdom influenza pandemic strategy which we know was created in 2011, and the Inquiry has heard from several sources that, despite certainly best efforts at a time close to the pandemic hitting, it was never updated.

Are you able to tell us whether this older document, created as it was in 2006, was ever updated to attempt to give more timely advice to Scotland on pandemic influenza?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Thank you.

It was never updated, but the reason why that was never updated was that, as you've outlined, we then had a pandemic of swine influenza. There was a UK discussion about how we would best learn the lessons and adopt recommendations from the learning lessons that we collectively had. That meant that there was a deliberate attempt to have a co-ordinated UK approach to how we deal with things.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: And although at the time that we did ask our Scottish Government colleagues about whether they would like this to be revisited, the clear indication that we had at the time was that we would be using a UK approach to deal with this.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right. So moving ahead from 2006, swine flu hits in 2009, the UK government commissioned the Hine review, which indeed led to the strategy being created in 2011. Once that was in place, did the UK strategy replace this older document, or did they sit alongside each other?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: That's right, it replaced things, because we were then working to a UK approach that was co-ordinated.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Can we take that down, please, and replace it with document INQ000147859, which is an interim report from the Health Protection Stocktake Working Group. We see that the date of that is July of 2011.

Do you know as a matter of fact whether or not this came into force before or after the UK strategy?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: I'm not quite sure because of the relative dates of when things were produced. I can't recall whether the reports were synchronous or not.

**Counsel Inquiry**: This was a working group established to examine the arrangements put in place in 2005, which I think had led to the 2006 strategy that we've just looked at, and to ensure that they were still fit for purpose; is that right?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And this interim report contains a series of recommendations. Could we go to page 46, please. Thank you. We can move through this quite quickly, but the recommendations relate firstly to capacity and resilience -- if we can scroll down, please -- roles and responsibilities, priorities and outcomes, governance, and consistency. Thank you.

This was an interim report. The final report which we can put up, please, at INQ000147828. Thank you. Can we go to page 44, please. Thank you very much. It sets out -- in fact can we go up to the previous page so that we can see what the columns ... there we are.

On the left-hand side I think we have the recommendations set out, and then the next column along, going from left to right, we can see whether the recommendation has made it into the final report from the interim report.

At the bottom, at number 34, page 42, we can see:

"Interchange should be arranged between staff of HPS and NHS boards and other activities considered to strengthen relationships and engender mutual respect and to help soften existing boundaries. This should include a wide range of activities including joint learning sessions; joint training and web-based initiatives."

If we move across we only see that that recommendation was in the interim report, but then in the right-hand column we have these words:

"MHPN, with the support of NHS boards and HPS ..."

Can you explain to us firstly, if you know, why this recommendation didn't make it into the final report, and what is meant by the bodies in the final column?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Perhaps in reverse order.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Okay.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: The MHPN I guess here is a managed health protection network. What ultimately came out of that was the Scottish Health Protection Network, an obligant network of stakeholders coming together who were mutually working with each other, including local authorities, to ensure that we had addressed all of the challenges presented within health protection.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So Managed Health Protection Network, yes, and that -- this tells us that that organisation was working with the support of the NHS boards and HPS.

So does that mean that, because those systems were already in place, that recommendation didn't need to be taken forward to the final report? Is that how it worked?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Well, for many of these things, that we were taking them beyond that --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: -- because, as I just suggested, that local authorities were now to become part and parcel of what we were trying to do, to make sure that local delivery was addressed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Can we go to page 44, please, and highlight the entry under "Roles and responsibilities". Here we can see:

"There is a need to improve communication between HPS and NHS boards. Interchange should be arranged between staff in both directions, and other activities considered to strengthen relationships and engender mutual respect and to help soften existing boundaries. This should include a wide range of activities including joint learning sessions, joint training and web-based initiatives."

We can see on the right-hand side the assessment is that:

"The [Managed Health Protection Network] is of course designed to help achieve a sense of integration between all parts of a service and should therefore be expected to serve a function of improving relationships and communication. However, our recommendation on interchange and other activities should stand."

So this is how it appears in the table.

Is the impression being created, Dr McMenamin, that there was a difficulty perceived in terms of relationships between these bodies and, if so, how was that manifesting itself and what was the proposed solution in order to engender better relationships?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: I think that the principal thing here that we were trying to address was a levelling up --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: -- to try and ensure that experience at a national level and at a local level was interchangeable, that we could then see and learn from each other. The Scottish Health Protection Network began to have that purpose by having that sharing of learning and experience across all of the health protection functions within Scotland.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And would you say that, following on from this final report, things did begin to improve?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: I think that it's certainly true that they were much improved as a consequence of the success of the Scottish Health Protection Network. That's not to say there are not continuing issues that we have had further effort to try and overcome.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right, thank you very much. We can take that down now.

Concentrating for a moment on the wider programme of health protection reform in Scotland, you tell us in your witness statement that the creation of Public Health Scotland was indeed part of a wider programme of public health reform, and you go on to note that HPS colleagues, yourself included, advocated throughout the reform period for recognition of the importance of actions to protect the public from outbreaks of communicable disease and incidents involving non-communicable environmental hazards to public health.

Why was HPS required to advocate in that way?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: I can offer you two potential answers to that, one which is a corporate one, and perhaps one a personal one.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, please do.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: So from a corporate perspective, I think that what was important here was that we were trying to ensure that there was health protection having its place at a table when the key objectives that were then listed were not immediately ones that jumped out saying health protection was at the centre of things. We had a further discussion on an ongoing basis about this, and that health protection we were assured was at the centre of everything that we were doing.

On a personal note, that I can see that, yes, that was important that we continued to advocate for clinical and scientific leadership for health protection being important because we were mindful of the importance of instance outbreaks and, regrettably, pandemics.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right, thank you.

May we look briefly, please, at INQ000102990, because moving forwards -- thank you very much -- this is the 2015 review of public health in Scotland. It was, as we can see, strengthening the function and refocusing action for a healthier Scotland, it had as its basis.

Can you provide a summary of this document, please? We can see that at the bottom, although it's headed 2015, it was actually produced finally in February of 2016.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Tell us what this is about, please, Dr McMenamin.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: So here, and coming back to our central rationale for what we were trying to do, it was important that we were trying to put health inequalities at the centre of everything that we were doing. You've heard already testimony from Bambra and Marmot about the stalling in life expectancy as one indicator of the health of the population. This was then occurring against this backdrop where we were very aware of the need to try and come together to address those health inequalities and hopefully to then have an increase in the healthy life expectancy of individuals.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

Was there anything within this review about the involvement of public health in terms of laboratories?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes, this is -- and it's important, I think, here that there is an important distinction that I have to offer about what you may have already heard in testimony about, for the Health Protection Agency --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: -- for Public Health England, and then the UK Health Security Agency. Unlike the situation for all of those successor organisations, Public Health Scotland's role in the laboratory services management was in a commissioning role only.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: So our opportunity then to have a great effort and discourse about that was certainly not something that was addressed in the main by this kind of document.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What role did HPS, and then later PHS, play in commissioning national microbiological reference laboratories? What role did it play?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: So right up until the end of the time period for which we are discussing, this pre-pandemic --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: -- period, our role was limited in the main to this commissioning role for the national laboratories that would be doing reference work. That's unlike the situation then where much of the routine work might be offered through either a combination of UKHSA laboratories in England and the NHS service laboratories.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Is it correct that the sponsors, the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, or COSLA, were engaged in developing an annual operation plan for PHS?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes, and we've continued -- and I know it goes beyond the timeframe of the examination today --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: -- but we're certainly very much encouraged by the ongoing work which has developed following on from the beginning of the pandemic, and that we are currently involved in for some of the commissioning work, going beyond that into what is the needs assessment that we have for laboratory services across all of Scotland.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I would like to ask you now about the provision of expert advice to the Scottish and the United Kingdom government and the extent of HPS's involvement in scientific advisory groups such as NERVTAG and SAGE.

What was the role of the Scottish public health service in the NERVTAG advisory group? Was it a member, to start off with?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: So NERVTAG -- and I'm sure that you've heard already quite a bit about this -- is an organisation which has been set up which has taken through a robust appointment process experts in individual areas. It just so happens that I was successful in application to that on a personal basis --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: -- rather than it being Public Health Scotland which are represented --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: -- at that type of meeting.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right, okay. And were there other representatives from other devolved nations also present when you were there?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: At its inception -- and it's changed over time -- then it's certainly been important to have opportunity for other colleagues to be co-opted into that process, and Professor Peter Horby in the most recent past then has been instrumental in trying to ensure that, dependent on the setting that we're considering, that there's an appropriate scientific representation across the whole of the country.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right.

In terms of the subject matter that NERVTAG considered during your time there, do you have a view as to whether or not that was more limited than it might have been? And, if it was, were there other aspects that you think as an organisation, as an advisory group, they would have benefitted from including in the matters that they considered and discussed?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yeah, I'm very much struck by both the testimony that I've heard from witnesses here but also from looking at the witness statements that have been provided both by Wendy Barclay and by Peter Horby.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: They give a good account, I think, of, that there is always this balance, a balance about: we have set questions that we're trying to address, because the government of the day have key things that they would like us to address, but that the scientific curiosity of many of these individuals in the same room is extraordinary, that these experts are often bringing complex issues that they have noted would be important for the group to begin to consider, and there's opportunity through that network to then encourage one or other of the administrations or the Department of Health to then put that down as a significant item for discussion at a next meeting.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. You may be aware of the evidence given earlier today by Sir Chris Whitty on this subject; he landed on an arbitrary percentage of 80/20.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: 80/20.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. But that, I think, accords with the evidence that you've just given --

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- that there needs to be a two-way street, which is another phrase taken from Sir Mark Walport's evidence.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Absolutely. I don't quite know what the percentage is, and as an epidemiologist you'd probably get an hour discourse from me about that. But, yes, I agree.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right, thank you very much.

We know from your witness statement that you also sat on SAGE representing HPS, as it then was, PHS as is now is, and tell us about your time there, please, Dr McMenamin, and whether you think that there are improvements that can be made in terms of the way that that advisory group conducts itself.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: My time as an observer in all of the proceedings, getting to as many of those as I possibly could, along with many colleagues, was it was an extraordinary examination, forensically at times, of the key challenges presented of the day. Those individuals who were coming, who were giving of their time freely, were truly incredible and I have nothing but respect for everything that they were able to say and do.

My role there was limited, perhaps, if there were key things that we were providing either as validation of observations that were occurring south of the border or in the other administrations, or for the first time being able to present interesting observations, particularly in the early days of the estimation of vaccine effectiveness, where we were able to say, using the EVE collaboration data that had been set up as a consequence of the hibernation projects set up after the swine flu pandemic, important observations there about early insight to what we might see in the population, an early light of a path potentially out of the lockdowns and social restrictions that we had in the population.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Whilst you were present at SAGE meetings, were you convinced that there were mechanisms in place to promote challenge and to ensure a range of views, as we've just discussed is so important in these advisory groups?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yeah, I think that all of the SAGE meetings were ably led by either of Sir Patrick Vallance or Chris Whitty or others who might be deputising on the day. There were great opportunities for colleagues to be able to say without reservation what their own views were about particular challenges, and to challenge mindset about any key things that were being discussed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

A different topic, now. I'd like to ask you about HPS's status as a Category 2 responder under the Civil Contingencies Act of 2004.

What is your view of it being assessed as a Category 2 responder? Do you think there is merit in its categorisation being raised to a Category 1 responder, or do you foresee difficulties if that were to happen?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: If I may, if I can present two things there.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, please.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Both a corporate thing and a personal thing.

From a corporate perspective, I can see that it is really important that we have a Category 1 response labelling, because we are at the heart of the assessment of risk, we are important in all of that.

On a personal basis, I can't understand why our organisation should not be designated as a Category 1 on the basis of the guidance and response function that we have in supporting major incidents and pandemics.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Becoming a Category 1 responder carries with it additional responsibilities and duties. Do you consider, Dr McMenamin, that Public Health Scotland is able to provide those and is the right organisation dealing with public health to be able to carry out those additional duties and responsibilities?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Absolutely, with one caveat, and that is obviously resource.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Funding, yes. All right, thank you.

Finally I'd like to take you through a series of scenario testing exercises and to ask your expert opinion on what you think worked well and what might be capable of being improved.

There are some names here that the Inquiry has not yet heard about, because they are Scottish specific. One back in April of 2009, an exercise called Cauld Craw. What was that all about, Dr McMenamin?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: So, as you might imagine, it would be something to do with a crow or the likes. Of course that avian influenza and influenza immediately spring to mind, and that's exactly what it was about.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

You note in your statement that the plans for this exercise were in fact overtaken by the swine flu pandemic and although it was well planned, the tabletop exercise itself did not take place. Was it rescheduled?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: I beg your pardon?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Was it rescheduled?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Which, sorry?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Cauld Craw.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yeah, I think that it was not rescheduled, particularly because we suddenly had a natural event that was presenting not too long afterwards with the swine influenza pandemic. So my understanding, at least of my own recollection, or of others at the time was that we had a natural challenge that immediately followed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Do you know whether any of the preparations for the exercise were able to be drawn upon when swine flu hit?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Certainly much of the constant evolution of thinking that we had in any of our preparedness was to address many aspects of what were to be covered by that kind of exercise. In particular, for the avian influenza database that ultimately became what you will I'm sure hear more about this the response to Module 2 with the first few 100s approach that we had for gathering clear, concise information about the first cases of any new infection.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Also known as FF100, isn't it?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The next exercise on my list is Castle Rock in September of 2010. I'm not going to ask you about the details of that because it simulated a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incident, so far from the topic of this Inquiry.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But I would like to ask you about the fact that this was an exercise led by both the UK and Scottish governments.

Do you have a view as to how well a joint operation such as that -- and we're going to come in a moment to talk about Exercise Cygnus -- but how something created by governments in two separate nations are capable of providing benefit to both of those nations? Is that something that you would promote, or do you think that the Scottish-only exercises, designed and focused as they were on Scotland, are better in the long run?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: I think the truth of it is that you need to have both. We need to have that local exercise capability to see what we can focus on. What sometimes is forgotten is every exercise can only focus on a few key things, it can't necessarily encompass everything. So having that opportunity to focus on that local issue becomes really important, particularly for the local authorities who might be dealing with that.

Whereas on a UK basis, having an understanding about how to relate to each of those constituent parts of the UK, where we will get key information from becomes important.

And one important thing that I should say about that is that for some aspects of environmental public health, Scotland is entirely reliant through a service-level agreement with the Health Protection Agency, Public Health England and the UK Health Security Agency, and that's reserved issues like radio, nuclear issues, et cetera.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Silver Swan took place over the latter part of 2015 and its aim was to assess the preparedness and response of Scotland's local and national arrangements for an influenza pandemic over a prolonged period.

This, I'm going to describe it as a rather successful exercise, focused on four areas: health and social care, excess deaths, business continuity and overall strategic co-ordination nationally. But of importance you say in your witness statement was what came out of that exercise concerning PPE.

Tell us about that, please, Dr McMenamin.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: So inevitably there are key things that come out of every exercise. You hope that you're challenging perceptions, identifying issues, in the expectation that you'll be able to address them in subsequent work.

Part of our organisation at the time within Health Protection Scotland was our Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection team, that's shorthanded to ARHAI. It's with much personal regret and corporately regret that we saw this part of our organisation didn't come with us into Public Health Scotland, it remained within National Services Scotland. It was, however, the most painless divorce, I'm sure, of medical and nursing teams --

**Counsel Inquiry**: That's good to hear.

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: -- because we continued, and continue to this day, to work very closely with our ARHAI colleagues who were an essential part of the pandemic response.

The reason why I'm focusing on that as background first is that it's this ARHAI team who have become pivotal to us in addressing everything to do with personal protection equipment, and although I can offer my own understanding of that from representing Public Health Scotland and HPS at the time, it might well be that a separate issue that you may wish to consider asking our ARHAI colleagues who remain within National Services Scotland.

The question that you asked, though, was: what happened? The key thing that we can see is that there are issues of interpreting what the safe use of personal protection equipment should be within the NHS. That becomes really important for us to make sure that we can have all of that sharing with the infection prevention and control teams in any of our hospital or secondary care settings, but also across the NHS estate.

That key learning was something that continues to be part of our discussions on an ongoing basis, including what we do for high-consequence infectious disease, and that our ARHAI colleagues are right up the middle of all of that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The fact that the provision of PPE and the stockpiling of it and the use of it across the whole of the health system in Scotland had been raised in the latter part of 2015 must have meant that, by the time Exercise Cygnus took part in October of 2016, that knowledge and those concerns could be carried forwards. Because you I think personally attended Exercise Cygnus, did you not, on behalf of HPS? And we know that the aim of that exercise was to assess preparedness and response across the whole of the United Kingdom for pandemic influenza. Did you in fact take to Exercise Cygnus the information and the knowledge that you had gained through Silver Swan?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Yes, indeed, not just me but many of my colleagues who were joining on behalf of either Health Protection Scotland or other parts of the NHS in Scotland.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And how did you find Exercise Cygnus? It was a huge undertaking, wasn't it? This Inquiry has heard that it involved 950 participants. As a matter of interest, did you travel down to England in order to attend, or were you attending remotely from Scotland? How did it work?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: My memory of that was attending remotely, I think, for that particular one.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right. We know it took place over the course of two days and that the initial scenario was that the influenza pandemic had just hit and then the further day was some time beyond that, once systems had been up and running for some time.

When you came away from Exercise Cygnus, did you believe that public health in Scotland was well prepared for the outbreak of a pandemic influenza, or did you appreciate that there were significant lessons that had been learned and preparations that needed to be put into place in order to get that level of preparation to an acceptable degree?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: I think the latter. Despite any great work by any number of very industrious colleagues working in the background, my own team included, but yes, there continued to be very significant things that we needed to continue to work on.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What actions did Public Health Scotland take away from Cygnus and are you able to tell us whether or not, by using a couple of examples, those were carried through and indeed were in place by the time the pandemic hit?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: Earlier I spoke about the Scottish Health Protection Network being used as an important vehicle to make sure that we and all of our colleagues then were sharing our own experience and learning. I think that the key thing that we were then coming back to was for personal protection equipment, as you've already highlighted, it is an essential bit of what we needed to do, and our ARHAI colleagues in particular were very, very focused on this, but also some other thinking then about high-consequence infectious disease and what we should be doing about that.

You may or may not know that Scotland does not have a high-consequence infectious disease unit. We rely then on, and through service level agreements, the excellent service that's offered through colleagues in England, where we then have to transfer patients that might require that high-consequence infectious disease management.

That's part of our reignited discussion that we're having north of the border currently about what should be the case in the new world that we are living in, where we are learning as much as we can about pandemic preparedness for the future.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And do you believe, either personally or corporately, that Scotland should have its own HCID system?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: I think certainly at the moment corporately that we wish to see what the balance is. We understand that of course there should be value for money in everything that we do. Is there a good enough case in this instance that there should be? My own personal perspective is that I'll be influenced by our infectious disease clinicians -- you spoke to just one of those earlier in the day with Professor Sir Chris Whitty -- south of the border, but it will be important that we have a view expressed by all of those colleagues about whether it would be important to have that capability locally or whether we continue to rely on the good grace of our UK colleagues to support us.

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you, Dr McMenamin.

Would you excuse my back, please, my Lady?

*(Pause)*

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you. My Lady, I can confirm there were no Rule 10 requests in relation to this witness, and so that completes Dr McMenamin's evidence.

**Lady Hallett**: Just one question from me, Dr.

You mentioned in your witness statement that you were doing a lessons learned report, and it would be available by April 2023; was it available by April 2023?

**Dr Jim McMenamin**: My Lady, my apologies, my understanding is that it was near completion but it's not yet completed. I can certainly ask my colleagues in the background and try and make that available as soon as possible.

**Lady Hallett**: That would really helpful, thank you very much indeed.

Well, thank you. I'm sorry we've kept you so long, I hope it hasn't mucked up your arrangements for returning home.

**The Witness**: Not at all.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: Very well, we'll finish there today, and I am sitting again at 10.30 on Monday.

**Ms Blackwell**: Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you all very much indeed.

*(4.30 pm)*

*(The hearing adjourned until 10.30 am on Monday, 26 June 2023)*
