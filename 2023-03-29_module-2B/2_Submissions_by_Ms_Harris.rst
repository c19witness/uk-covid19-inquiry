2. Submissions by Ms Harris
===========================

**Ms Harris**: Good morning. Bore da.

**Baroness Hallett**: Bore da.

**Ms Harris**: I appear to make submissions on behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru and I will confirm straightaway that I won't be going over the time that has been allocated to me and if my Lady is content I propose to speak in Welsh initially and then to translate the Welsh language part of my submissions into English and then to continue in English. Thank you.

Fel y gwyr y cadeirydd, grwp ydy Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru gyda ffocws yn gyfangwbl ar ymgyrchu dros, a rhoi llais i rai sydd mewn profedigaeth oherwydd Covid-19 yng Nghymru.

Byddaf yn delio a'r testunnau canlynnol â€“ Rhestr o faterion, Ceisiadau Rheol 9, tystiolaeth arbenigol, ac yn fyr -- y broses o ddatgelu a trefniadau ar gyfer gwrandawiadau a delio a tystiolaeth. Bydd hyn yn rhannol drwy gyfrwng y Gymraeg at wedyn yn Saesneg.

Rhestr o faterion

1. Diolch I'r CTI y bore ma am y wybodaeth mai'r bwriad you darparu rhestr o faterion erbyn dyddiad penodol.

2. Mae hi wedi bod o gymorth mawr i gael y rhestr dros dro o faterion are gyfer modiwl 1 -- mae hon yn ddogfen gynhwysfawr a defnyddiol.

3. Mae yna fantais mewn cynhyrchu rhestr or faterion dros dro cyn gynteg ag sy'n bosib.

Unwaith bod gan y cyfranogwyr craidd y rhestr materion bydd yn bosib paratoi yn fwy effeithiol.

Rheswm arall pan mae'n bwysig I gael y rhestr o faterion yw bod modiwlau'n cydberthyn au gilydd, a dim ond pan gawn weld rhestri materion i'r modiwlau sydd a testunnau sydd berthnasol a'u gilydd y gallem eu rhoi ochr wrth ochr a sicrhau bod materion sydd yn ymwneud a Chymru ddim wedi syrthio i fwlch rhwng modiwlau gwahannol.

I droi at beth dylsid cynnwys yn y rhestr o faterion ar gyfer Modiwl 2B.

4. Yn ein cyflwyniadau ysgrifenedig rydym wedi nodi rhai o'r materion my CBFJ Cymru o'r farn sy'n bwysig i'w cynnwys ym Modiwl 2B, sef yn arbennig:

(i) Sut ac i ba raddau wnaeth Llywodreath Cymru a llywodreath y Deyrnas Unedig ryngwethio a chyfarthrebu a rhannu gwybodaeth hefo eu gilydd -- yn arbennig gwybodaeth wyddonol ac arbenigol

(ii) Beth wneath Llywodreath Cymru yn wahannol -- camau a gymerwyd neu a na gymerwyd -- a oedd yn wahannol i'r rheiny a gymerodd llywodraeth y deyrnas unedig. Rydym wedi gweld yr awgrymiad synhwyrol a wnaed yng nghyflwyniadau ysgrifenedig y Mudiadau am Bobl Anabl -- sef i arbenigwr i greu nodyn dros dro yn crynhoi gwahaniaethau allweddol rhwng rheolau a penderfyniadiau a wnaethpwyd gan y naill lywodreath, ac mae'r grwp dwy i'n ei gynrychioli yn cytuno byddai maintais mewn cael dogfen o'r math, a fyddai'n darparu man cychwyn i'r tystiolaeth a dadansoddiad i'r rhan yma o fodiwl 2B.

As my Lady is aware, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru are a Wales-focused group dedicated solely to campaigning for and giving voice to those bereaved due to Covid-19 in Wales.

I propose to address you on the scope, the Rule 9 requests, expert witnesses and then briefly on disclosure and arrangements for evidence and hearings.

First with regards to scope, we have heard the helpful submissions from counsel to the Inquiry this morning and the aim that a list of issues will be made available by 12 May. We welcome bringing forward the provision of the list of issues and the provisional list of issues for comments that would be as soon as possible and we note that the provisional list of issues that is being made available in relation to Module 1 is a very comprehensive and helpful document.

We note also that, by having such a document, it enables progress to be made much more quickly in preparation for the main hearing and, inevitably, modules are inter-related and it is only when we have the list of issues for closely related modules, so that we can look at them together and compare them, that we can be sure that issues concerning Wales have not fallen between the gaps. This is the subject upon which we have also made submissions in relation to Module 3.

As to what the issues should include to be on that list, in the written submission, on behalf of the Covid Bereaved Families, we have highlighted some of the matters that the group consider are important to include in this Module 2B and these are, in particular, how and to what extent the Government of Wales and the UK Government interacted and communicated and shared information with each other, in particular scientific and expert knowledge and what the Welsh Government did differently, steps taken or not taken, that differ from those of the UK Government.

We have seen the helpful suggestion in the written submissions on behalf of the disabled people's organisations that there should be a provisional note summarising the key differences in regulations and decisions and those whom I represent endorse having such a document which, as regards this aspect of Module 2B, would be a good starting point for the evidence and analysis.

Turning now to Rule 9 requests. The main submission on behalf of the bereaved families is as to the importance of including vulnerable and at-risk groups to whom Rule 9 requests are made and to include, within those groups, groups representing older people in Wales.

Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru very much welcome that a corporate statement has been requested from the Older People's Commissioner for Wales and think this would be an important document but the group wishes to make the point that it is, of course, important that there are different perspectives as well that are sought from a wider group of organisations working on the ground.

As regards Rule 9 requests, we, of course, have seen the monthly updates from the CTI and they provide very helpful information about the groups upon whom Rule 9 requests have been served and we have heard also the very reassuring submissions that have been made this morning as to the further service of Rule 9 requests and the attention that is given to vulnerable and at-risk groups.

Our concern is that, as has been mentioned, that groups that speak on a nationwide basis may not be able to pay sufficient focus to Wales and we know that the CTI has heard that point and taken it on board.

We are also concerned as to whether there are sufficient groups upon whom Rule 9 requests have been served within Wales, that are Wales-specific groups, that are focused on older people. We ask that consideration is given, as I know it will be, having heard the reassurance from the Inquiry this morning -- that consideration will be given to the list that we have suggested which includes at least one group relating to older people in Wales.

I wish to make some further points about the position of older people in Wales, in order to highlight the importance of bringing forward evidence about this group of the population in Wales. The numbers of older people, as a proportion of the population, are relatively high in Wales, the group over-65 being over one fifth of the population and those over 90 being higher relatively than other parts in the UK, being 1 per cent of the population.

The pandemic had, and the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru believes continues to have, a disproportionate impact on older people, in particular those living in the relatively deprived areas in Wales. A particular concern of the Covid Bereaved Families group is the extent of the hospital acquired Covid-19 in Wales and recent data shows that a high percentage of Covid-19 infection in Wales continues to be hospital-acquired infection. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru are of a view that it is likely that older people feature heavily in that percentage of Covid-19 infections that are acquired in hospitals.

For all these reasons, the bereaved families are concerned that the Inquiry should have a complete picture of the impact of the pandemic on older people in Wales.

I would like to touch on that matter again when I deal with expert evidence and, turning now to expert evidence, there are two matters upon which I would like to address the Inquiry. We call on the Inquiry to instruct an expert to report specifically on the devolved decision making structures in Wales and how they interrelate, including in an emergency situation, and we have heard what the CTI submissions have said this morning and that they are considering such a report to be brought forward, and we are very reassured by that consideration and we endorse it.

The Welsh perspective and the impact of devolution on the competency and resilience of the Welsh Government does need to be properly explored, in our submission, and properly understood in this Inquiry. This report would provide an essential evidential foundation from which the issues of concern to the Inquiry can be explored and developed in relation to Wales. This is particularly so, given that there will inevitably be limited time for the oral hearing. Put simply, it saves time to have such a report.

There is a need, we submit, for detailed expert evidence such as this focusing specifically on the Welsh perspective, as regards devolved institutions. We have drawn attention in our written submissions as to how, when matters are dealt with at a national level, there does tend to be an emphasis on UK-wide institutions and English institutions, rather than those of the devolved nations.

I would like to mention the expert evidence that is to be brought forward in relation to structural discrimination and Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru welcomes your Ladyship's rulings on reporting on structural racism and for the exploration of expert evidence on discrimination on other grounds and on intersectional issues and endorses the invitation that was made this morning in submissions to the Inquiry for there to be a Wales-specific reporting on these issues, in relation to structural racism and other forms of discrimination.

I would like to address the Inquiry specifically with regards to the importance of bringing forward expert evidence with regards to the impact of the pandemic on older people in Wales. This is necessary in my submission in order to understand the characteristics of this at-risk cohort and it is also necessary in order to have a clear evidential foundation as to the impact of the pandemic on this group.

Again, it will save time at the hearing where time will inevitably be tight. It will contribute towards ensuring that matters concerning Wales are properly scrutinised, do not get lost and not properly looked at in the great amount of material that there is to be considered in this UK-wide Inquiry and so that the best time can be made out of the time that there is for the focus on Wales.

Again, we would like the opportunity as a group to communicate with the Inquiry with regards to suggestions for a suitable expert to deal specifically with the older people dimension.

Turning briefly to disclosure. We have heard that the Inquiry team is, of course, doing its best to deal with disclosure as quickly as possible and we encourage them, of course, to continue to do so and we are very grateful for those efforts.

With regards to the hearing timetable, we have heard this morning that it is proposed that the length of the hearing will be three weeks. That, of course, is a positive development. Nevertheless, there is concern amongst those in the group whom I represent about there being sufficient time for the scrutiny that is required as a result of this hearing in Module 2B.

There is a deep concern on the part of the group that it's proposed to cover the impact and handling of the pandemic within what was two weeks but even now three weeks. The group is concerned that this may not allow for adequate scrutiny nevertheless, even with the extra time. There is no other Inquiry for Wales, the First Minister having, of course, refused a Wales-specific Inquiry akin to the Scottish Public Inquiry in reliance on this Inquiry. The concern is that the devolved Welsh Government will escape full scrutiny and we invite consideration of a further extension of the time allocated to this module.

We once again would like to endorse and reiterate the suggestion which has been made by the TUC that a short hearing be listed after all the Module 2 submodule hearings are completed in order to take account of the lessons learned across all the modules.

Finally, with regards to hearings, we hear that it is the intention that the Inquiry will provide translation facilities into Welsh and, of course, we welcome this.

With regards to the evidence proposal and Rule 10, we welcome the process of providing for an informal approach in order to be able to speak to the Inquiry team in relation to the evidence proposals and proposed questions and we note the confirmation that this informal process does not, in any way, impede the rights under Rule 10.4 to apply to the Chair for permission to ask questions or CPs to be able to ask such questions of witnesses in their own right and we submit that this is an important right which serves to increase public confidence in the Inquiry.

Finally, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru welcomes the work on commemoration and Every Story Matters and wishes to reiterate its commitment to assisting with the development of this project.

Thank you. Those are my submissions.

**Baroness Hallett**: Diolch, Ms Harris. Very grateful to you, both for your helpful submissions and for the extremely helpful co-operation members of Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru have been giving to the listening exercise and commemoration project. I hope that those who participated in the filming, which is obviously so important for us, didn't find it too distressing but you have been giving us great co-operation and we are really, really grateful. Thank you.

**Ms Harris**: Thank you.

**Baroness Hallett**: Mr Straw, I think, next.

**Mr Straw**: Good morning. Can you hear me, my Lady?

**Baroness Hallett**: I can Mr Straw, thank you.
