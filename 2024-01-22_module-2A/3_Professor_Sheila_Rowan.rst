Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry you have been kept waiting for so long.

**The Witness**: It's okay.

**Ms Arlidge**: You're Professor Sheila Rowan?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: I am.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm going to ask you, please -- sorry, I'm not going to ask you to turn to it. I'm going to ask for your witness statement dated 14 November. Someone's already ahead of me. It's INQ000274012. Hopefully that comes up on your screen.

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: It does.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Is that a familiar document to you?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: It is.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You, between 2016 and June 2021, were the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Scottish Government; is that correct?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And you were -- your successor in that role was Julie Fitzpatrick from the date of you leaving.

I should say, my Lady, that there is a witness statement from Ms Fitzpatrick, Professor Fitzpatrick, which is INQ000352847. I'm not going to bring it up on screen, but that's for reference.

You were seconded, Professor Rowan, from the University of Glasgow for three days a week to carry out the Chief Scientific Adviser role for Scottish Government; is that right?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You hold the chair of, I think still do, natural philosophy at that university?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: I do.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And in fact during your time of secondment you remained an employee of the University of Glasgow rather than an employee of the Scottish Government; is that right?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's correct, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just in terms of clarifying the position, is it right that your role -- it's not a criticism -- as chair of philosophy doesn't have any direct relevance in terms of scientific knowledge about the pandemic, for instance?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So, my professional background is that indeed I'm a professor of physics. However, I would add that I bring with that 20 years of experience in working in and leading interdisciplinary teams to solve difficult scientific challenges and, importantly for the CSA role, a very wide range of professional networks across all scientific areas.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Because your role is to bring together, as the Chief Scientific Adviser, is to bring in knowledge from different sources and act as a sort of central figurehead point to bring those matters together; is that right?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Yes, as Chief Scientific Adviser one of the prerequisites for the role is to be able to access scientific expertise across all domains in science, so coming in with a very wide network of contacts enables ministers and officials to use the CSA across cross-cutting science areas.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And it's about effectively knowing the right people to ask the right questions of, at the right time, because of your expertise in that cross-cutting role?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Absolutely, utilising those wide networks.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And presumably those wide networks are across the research world, it's not simply limited to, for instance, the University of Glasgow or whichever university you happen to be employed with at that particular time?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: No, indeed, they're very wide networks. They cross, as I say, all scientific disciplines, certainly not institution specific nor discipline specific, so a very, very wide range of areas.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And it's not a dissimilar role in that respect to the Chief Scientific Adviser in Westminster, in terms of -- the Inquiry's already heard evidence about his particular expertise, but that was simply he happened to be that person in the role at that particular time, he's not appointed to be the scientific adviser who gives all of the advice about everything, he brings that thing together, he brings that data together and the expertise together; so in that respect your role is not dissimilar from the UK Chief Scientific Adviser?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So there are both similarities and differences to the role, and the similarities are certainly -- and I think this is quite important -- that there is no requirement for either of the UK Government Chief Science Adviser or the Scottish Government Chief Science Adviser to come from a particular discipline. They can be from any discipline, and in both nations historically have come from a wide variety of backgrounds.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You mentioned the cross-cutting role that you play. By that do you mean that it's part of your role to have eyes on the science across Scottish Government and across the country and your areas of science across the system, rather than focusing and drilling into one specific area every day?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So it's about being there to be a resource who can be consulted on any particular science area and then knowing where to access the expertise to draw out the evidence, to draw out the information such that government can use that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Now, one difference is you -- your secondment is three days a week.

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: It was three days a week. Was that the case throughout the pandemic as well as in normal times?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So, it was formally the case throughout the pandemic, although obviously during that time I prioritised matters for Scottish Government and reorganised my time accordingly. So although that was formally the case, I did during that time spend more time on pandemic matters than other things.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Because the reality is that it was a fast-moving situation and --

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- asking the right questions at the right time of the right people was no doubt a full-time job?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Correct. It was of course a fast-moving time, and I prioritised my efforts accordingly.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Your role as the Chief Scientific Adviser sat, at the time of your role, I understand, within the directorate for education, communities and justice, and then subsequently the director education and justice; is that right?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: It was subsequently, I think, transferred to the directorate of economy. Do you have any insight into why the role sat where it did and why it was moved?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So I think there's a certain -- so I don't know, first of all, the reasons why the CSA role or who made the decision to position it in Education and Justice during my tenure, that was a decision made before I took up the role. I would say there's a certain logic to having it there in that it's adjacent to the higher education and science part of Scottish Government. Understandably that science and research area is one in which the CSA has interest. But I don't know if there are specific reasons for why it was there, nor why it was moved.

**Counsel Inquiry**: When you took up the role -- dealing very briefly, appreciating you took up the role in 2016 -- but when you took up the role at that time, I think you say in your statement that the post had been vacant for about 18 months beforehand; is that right?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I think you accept that, as a result, that did mean there were gaps in the advisory system that existed and was set up. Of course by the time the pandemic came along you'd been in post for some time. You've set up, I think, a scientific advisory -- advice framework as well to sort of -- is that -- is it right to say that it's sort of codifying how science should be accessed across Scottish Government?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's so. When I took up the role, I did indeed work with colleagues in my support team, and indeed reached out across to government to understand its scientific advisory needs, and together we put together as framework, as you say, which gave a guide to the principles that policy officials can use to access scientific advice in government.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Because if there's already a source of science within government, for instance, there's already a scientist dealing with a particular issue, it probably doesn't require so much outside engagement or outside research if there's already a framework in place, but equally there will be elements that are not covered by, effectively, embedded scientists in various departments?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's right. So what the principles of that framework say are: if there is a domain specific need and there is a domain expert, a topic expert in Scottish Government, they would be a good first port of call to refer to. In addition to that, they also say, quite clearly, where there is no expert in an area in Scottish Government, you can use the CSA to help source scientific advice based on the cross-cutting nature of the CSA role and its ability to reach out widely across topic areas.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In doing so, was part of your role to advise on the right questions to ask when people were coming to you for: where do I go and ask this question? Was it also part and parcel of the role to help formulate the questions that were being put?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: I would say less to help formulate the questions being put, but to help people understand what a constructive question looks like in terms of scientific advice, so that they could get useful answers back.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And then did your role also involve interpreting the answers that came back as necessary?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Can I check, do you mean answers back ...?

**Counsel Inquiry**: So when the questions had been given to whichever adviser, whichever scientist, whichever group --

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Sure.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- and a paper comes back, were you involved in the interpretation, assisting in the interpretation of that paper where necessary?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: When necessary, again, that -- and specifically during the pandemic, I would say as CSA I had two key roles, one of which was indeed in attending SAGE, potentially being a point of contact between the Scottish system and SAGE, in terms of SAGE advice and how that might feed into the Scottish system and have the Scottish lines applied to it, and the other one was again the ability to, if needed, identify who an expert might be to help.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Turning to sort of more specific experience of the pandemic and your role therein, we learn from your witness statement, paragraph 36 on page 11, that you were brought into the room, as it were, in terms of Covid-19, January 2020, as a result of that SAGE meeting in January 2022 -- sorry, 22 January 2020. Too many 2s. And you attended that meeting, you were invited to that meeting, as CSA for Scotland?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: No, that's not correct. So the meeting on 22 January 2020 was a precautionary SAGE meeting with a very small, limited number of attendees, and that pre-dated my attendance at SAGE.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So is it right, then, to say that you went to the first formal SAGE meeting, as it were, rather than the precautionary SAGE meeting?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: No, there were a series of SAGE meetings between January, throughout February, March onwards, and the first SAGE meeting at which I was a formal attendee was in April.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Why the gap?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Sure. So, as we've discussed, the role of -- the framework for science advice in Scottish Government indicates that when there is a topic relevant need -- in this case, associated with the pandemic, that would be for public health advice, medical and clinical advice -- the first port of call, the person who would take the lead on that advice would be the Chief Medical Officer, not the Chief Scientific Adviser. So I did have a role during that time, but it was not to lead on the public health advice.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Did that run the risk, at least, of you not having sufficient eyes across that cross-cutting element in the early days of the pandemic in terms of emerging knowledge and the fast-moving pace and the various threads that had to be pulled together?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So I would say no, what -- the way the system works is that the SAGE advice formally comes to the Chief Scientific Adviser, as I was then, and my office, so we're sighted on each of the SAGE minutes, the minutes formed the advice, so that sight was there, and my role was to ensure that those were passed quickly to SGoRR, the Scottish Government Resilience Room, who have the formal responsibility of co-ordinating emergency response, so that they could access the relevant topic experts, which in this case, as I say, would be the Chief Medical Officer and colleagues in Health Resilience.

So -- and during that time, the predominant need was for public health advice during the January, February, March period. I would say, having seen and indeed reviewed the SAGE minutes, it was only by sort of March and then into April that it became clear that the scale and kind of response needed was going to be wider than strictly public health, virology, epidemiology, and that wider expertise could be needed, and that's the point at which I started to attend SAGE.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So March/April time was the first time that the sort of cross-cutting element of your role came to the fore; is that fair?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's correct. And, again, to help understand that, if you look at the SAGE attendees, I think in April Professor Cath Noakes started as a SAGE attendee, she's a mechanical engineer. That's a topic that might not naturally come to mind when considering pandemic response, but the recognition was surfacing that wider expertise, cross-cutting expertise could well be important in the response, and so that's where my role can serve.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Because Professor Noakes was a mechanical engineer, was talking about like aerosolisation or the risk of particles and what -- how matters -- how the virus might be spread through the air, and obviously others were talking about how the virus might be spread through touchpoints and the like, and that brings together -- that's a good example, is it, of a mechanical engineer being able to look at it from a slightly different angle, perhaps?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Bring her expertise in fluid dynamics in the built environment, in the engineering of buildings, to bring that expertise to bear, and she played an important role.

**Counsel Inquiry**: When you became more involved in the cross-cutting role, March/April time, what discussions were you having, both at that time and before that, with the then Chief Medical Officer about the focus, what could be brought to bear from other aspects in Scottish Government away from just the pure CMO approach?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So I would say up until March/April the response was very focused on, you know, clinical, medical, epidemiological needs, and so I did discuss with the then CMO, Catherine Calderwood, the expertise that she wished to draw on in putting together the Covid-19 Advisory Group, which through its terms of reference is constituted -- it's still mostly in that response space, because that was still, the primary need was the public health response and associated areas, but she requested that I attend the, and was a member of the Covid-19 Advisory Group, and that brought that ability to reach out further if needed. But the terms of reference of that group were still mostly in the public health area; I performed the link to wider expertise.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And when -- I think in your statement, paragraph 24, you talk about this being set up even before the pandemic, but you also had this -- had CSA, four nations CSA discussions and meetings and ... when did they start to ramp up in the context of pandemic matters?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So the CSAs met weekly actually throughout the entire tenure of my time as CSA, so that pre-dated anything to do with the pandemic, and those particular four nations CSA meetings -- so that's the CSAs of the UK Government departments, plus the UK Government CSA, plus the -- me as the Scottish, and also the Welsh CSA -- the topic of those meetings was wide. That's the ability to have cross-cutting discussions, not actually necessarily about pandemic response, those could be about cross-cutting topics. So they were not focused on developing advice for the pandemic.

The CSAs could receive updates on the progress of the pandemic, but they served a different purpose, and I would say were extremely effective in building and maintaining contacts between the CSAs across, again, a wide range of backgrounds and formed one of the networks of expertise that we could all access.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of -- so you spoke about SCAG, and setting that up, and your role in that. You attended SCAG, didn't you?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: I did.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And you then also attended a series of subgroups. The Inquiry's heard and will hear, continue to hear, lots of evidence about SCAG more broadly. So what I would like to do right now is very briefly drill down into some of the detail of the subgroups that you were on.

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Sure.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You were on the education and children's Issues subgroup?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And you were also on the university and colleges subgroup?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's correct, very briefly. It formed only shortly before I came to the end of my time as CSA.

**Counsel Inquiry**: That's exactly the sort of question I was going to come to. It formed May 2021, somewhere around then. The Inquiry has heard and will no doubt continue to hear evidence about issues surrounding university students in late 2020 and the concern that the return of students to university and close quarters in university halls of residence and the like were driving pandemic figures in late 2020 as the term returned, students returned to school -- to university.

If the universities subgroup wasn't set up until May 2021, who was giving advice to the Scottish Government about those sorts of very specific but quite high profile matters that were feeding into Scottish Government decision-making?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So I think it's an important point to realise that SAGE performs an advisory role for the whole of the UK, and throughout the pandemic SAGE remained the core source of scientific advice for all of the nations. The Scottish Government Covid Advisory Group was not re-doing SAGE's work, not duplicating SAGE's work, it was simply applying a Scottish lens to the advice that was coming from SAGE and adding in local information to help advise Scottish Government. So even without the formation of an education -- universities and further education subgroup, SAGE could provide a core source of scientific advice for all the nations.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So what then prompted the subgroup to be set up in May 2021?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So I'm afraid the setting up of the subgroup would really be a matter for the CMO to answer, because each of these subgroups, when they formed, fed in through the Scottish Government Covid Advisory Group to then provide a source of advice for the CMO.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You also attended the schools and education group, so were you the only person to be on all three -- attending SCAG main -- the main SCAG and those two subgroups?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: No, I think Professor Carol Tannahill, who chaired the education subgroup, and I think subsequently originally the university subgroup, also then attended the main Scottish Government Covid Advisory Group to maintain links between those entities. I was, however, the only attendee on the education and children's subgroup who also attended SAGE.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So, again, was this an example of your cross-cutting function as well and the links that you can build up in your role?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Exactly. So, again, this is an area where the CSA can act to perform a role in linking different science areas, in attending SAGE, then be able to help that subgroup access the underlying evidence from SAGE, or indeed elsewhere in my network, to inform the discussions of the subject experts on that group.

**Counsel Inquiry**: A different element of your cross-cutting role, I think, the chiefs group from May 20 -- from mid-2020.

If we can have your statement up, please, at page 3. It might even be page 4, because it's paragraph 10.13, my apologies.

*(Pause)*

**Counsel Inquiry**: We can do it without the statement, don't worry.

There comes a point in mid-2020 --

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- when you say it was recognised that there was no -- although there were all these different groups available, what there wasn't necessarily was a single area or single forum for the Scottish Government advisers to collectively come together and communicate each of their own individual expertise in a small group setting. Is that right?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And is that what sort of prompted the institution of what's known as the chiefs group?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: Yes. So there were fora in which combinations of the chief advisers would be present, be understanding the different roles that one another were performing and discuss that. There was no forum, no one forum where all the chief advisers met and could share information about ongoing commissions, take a strategic look at what future advice might be needed, and then collectively have that understanding of what one another were doing.

So, you know, science advice certainly was proceeding strongly. I would say the most useful role of that group was simply information sharing so that each adviser then could go off and do their own job.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Was there a concern or potential concern that effectively, because different groups were meeting separately, that there was a risk that information might fall between the gaps, as it were, because of the fast-moving nature of the pandemic?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So I'd no reason to believe that anything was falling between the gaps. However, you can always make things better, and so putting that group in place just put in place an additional forum in which we could all be sighted on one another's activity, and the utility of that exercise was such that I believe some form of that group continues.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we just very briefly have up on screen INQ000321345, I think this is the original proposal, as it were, for setting up the chiefs group.

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So this is a document that I have not seen in preparation.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm not going to ask you any detail of the granularity about it, and I can apologise -- I apologise for that.

Can I just -- if we look at page 3, this is, I think, sort of summing up what you've just said in many ways, but paragraph 10: bringing together small body of groups of advisers to lead the forward planning to ensure that advice can be delivered, liaising with colleagues in the government as appropriate, and this would help to identify where new thematic sectoral subgroups should be established and advise on their membership.

Is it right that, as time moved on, this ended up -- instead of it being a body that the idea of ministers coming to the group and sort of commissioning further advice, commissioning further investigations or studies or policy papers to be provided, is it right that in fact what happened in reality was it just gave a more focal point, a visibility? I think you say in your statement that it created a sort of -- it helped to increase the visibility of the sources of information across Scottish Government, rather than being a direct sort of advisory body in itself; is that fair?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So the group could have been commissioned to directly provide advice to ministers. It did not, in my time, operate in that way. As I've said, essentially it allowed internal visibility and information sharing of the activities of the different chief advisers with one another.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Would it have improved the group, would it have improved access to information across government had it had more of a commissioning -- had more involved in the role that it could have had?

**Professor Sheila Rowan**: So I'm afraid that that's a question I don't have the insight to answer for you.

**Ms Arlidge**: Fair enough. Then I have nothing further for you. Let me just bend over and see if there's anything.

My Lady, do you have anything further?

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Arlidge.

Thank you very much, Professor. I hope you have a safe journey back to Glasgow. I hope the trains are running again, are they?

**The Witness**: I hope so too.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much. 10 o'clock tomorrow, please.

**Ms Arlidge**: I'm grateful, thank you, my Lady.

*(4.40 pm)*

*(The hearing adjourned until 10 am on Tuesday, 23 January 2024)*
