7. Submissions on Behalf of Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK, Scottish Vaccine Injury Group and UK CV Family by Ms Morris KC
===========================================================================================================================

**Ms Morris**: Thank you, my Lady.

My Lady, alongside Mr Bradley and Mr Weaver of counsel, instructed by Mr Wilcox of Hudgell Solicitors, I represent three core participant groups: the Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK, the Scottish Vaccine Injury Group and the UK CV Family. You have our written submissions and I'm grateful that they have been considered carefully by Counsel to the Inquiry and for the responses provided this morning. We have in turn listened carefully to Mr Keith King's Counsel's submissions this morning and I would like to emphasise a few key points.

I will deal with the most practical point first, my Lady, the timetabling of hearings, because for those I represent the delay in substantive oral hearings from July this year to January next year has a significant impact. It may be seen as modest in the Inquiry's timings but it's significant to those I represent. The delays only serve to further exacerbate the feelings of marginalisation within the groups and has caused considerable stress to people who have also already faced significant challenges.

There are several significant implications. Members of our groups have serious degenerative conditions and will face deterioration in their health over the next six months. Others are still enduring a long wait for treatment that is being denied to them, meaning that their conditions will increasingly impact on their ability to participate and engage. And I ask my Lady to bear in mind that the fact that the hearings will now be in the middle of winter also means that those with respiratory conditions will find travelling difficult or impossible.

The delay in the substantive hearings and the establishment of a clear factual narrative around the Covid-19 vaccines maintains a large lacuna in the public understanding within which important questions continue to go unanswered and within which further serious mistrust of government and healthcare institutions may grow.

The delay in the Inquiry recording a clear factual narrative also undermines its ability to make meaningful recommendations for change, which we know are important to you, my Lady. We have impressed on you before the sheer number of people in the UK likely to have been injured by the Covid-19 vaccines. As of 10 May 2024 we understand the Yellow Card system to have received 2,688 reports of fatalities and 486,250 individual reports, over 300,000 of which were reported as serious.

These weren't just injuries reported in relation to vaccines that have now been withdrawn from the UK, and it's important to note that the Covid-19 vaccine programme continues in the UK for some cohorts.

The groups that I represent have urged you, my Lady, to make critical recommendations in key areas that significantly impact their lives. These include the need for medical, financial, emotional and cultural support. A pressing example of this is the need for reform of the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. And without reform, thousands of people are being left without proper recourse to compensation or financial support, and are exposed to ongoing disbelief and a continued lack of medical and emotional support for their injuries and online abuse.

Therefore, my Lady, given the delay as the Inquiry receives and considers evidence, we are urging you to consider making interim recommendations, particularly focused on the provision of medical, emotional and financial support for the vaccine injured and bereaved.

In addition to the concerns I've set out regarding delay, we echo the concerns raised by others in relation to the duration of the oral hearings. Even on the scope now proposed in the recent CTI note and outlined by Mr Keith this morning, we submit that a thorough and adequate investigation cannot be achieved within 11 or 12 days. The Inquiry has currently requested statements from over 120 witnesses. We simply ask: how is it possible to hear that significant evidence in that timescale?

May I then turn to the issue of scope, my Lady, and this will be the main focus of my oral submissions.

Dealing first, please, with vaccine safety, we of course are pleased to hear that the Inquiry considers the issue of vaccine safety as a hugely important issue. We agree.

Mr Keith has reiterated this morning that it will not be possible to examine matters in the level of a single-issue inquiry, but, my Lady, it's important to note at the outset that over 100,000 members of the public, via parliamentary petition, called for such a single-issue inquiry regarding the safety of the Covid-19 vaccines. The government has to date refused to establish such an inquiry, citing the fact that my Lady's Inquiry would examine the Covid-19 pandemic.

It was said by Counsel to the Inquiry in their written note and this morning again that they want to focus on systems, processes and outcomes and how they can be improved. Our first submission, and it may simply be a use of language but it bears stating, is that any focus on outcomes of the vaccine must acknowledge and record the facts that, for many people, those outcomes were injury or bereavement from the vaccine.

The Inquiry states that it will examine the nature and efficacy of the regulatory regime for the approval of vaccines, but we have raised the question: how can the Inquiry assess regulation without understanding and scrutinising the underlying data before the regulators? And Mr Keith agrees that this is a necessary examination within the Inquiry's approach.

But we urge the Inquiry to approach with a forensic and critical mind to the data it's presented with. Who was presenting the data to the regulators? Was it accurate? Was it adequate? Did the regulators properly explore or test that data in making their determinations on vaccine safety?

In their written note, Counsel to the Inquiry also stated that it would address the safety-related debate over vaccines but will not reach a concluded view on the safety of specific vaccines or attempt to quantify the precise risk of vaccination.

My Lady, I make the simple point that this is not a debate for those I represent; the vaccine was not safe for them and it has caused physical injury and/or bereavement. In our submission, the role of this Inquiry is not to address the safety debate, it is to find facts and record an accurate narrative of vaccine safety. The Inquiry states it is concerned with specific vaccine-related issues such as misinformation and disinformation. However, if the Inquiry does not record an accurate public narrative of vaccine safety, then a vacuum remains with a lot of probing, unsettling and unanswered questions within which further misinformation and disinformation can be spread.

The Inquiry also wants to understand vaccine hesitancy and how to improve vaccine confidence. However, without an accurate narrative of vaccine safety, the Inquiry will not be able to understand what the factors impacting on confidence might have been in the past, which are highly likely to include concerns around safety. In our submission, any analysis of vaccine confidence is fundamentally flawed without understanding the true impact and risk of the vaccine and what was known about that risk at the time of the roll-out as well as how that risk was perceived.

The groups that I represent are concerned that throughout the pandemic there was a persistent narrative that vaccines were safe and that the benefits outweighed the risks. In our submission, the Inquiry should examine what is meant by a vaccine having a "favourable safety profile" and how these safety profiles are assessed and, for example, what criteria were used.

Moreover, a genuine concern arises regarding what we perceive as a significant deficiency in the dissemination of vaccine risk information, both generally but in particular among individuals from minoritised backgrounds, potentially attributed to structural discrimination.

This discrimination, potentially evidenced by factors such as access to healthcare resources, language barriers and distrust in medical institutions, may have hindered some communities' understanding of the risks associated with the vaccine.

I now turn to my second issue in relation to scope, that is the vaccine as a condition of deployment, for which we include employment and enrolment, and we're grateful to the Inquiry for ruling that this issue is something that Module 4 will explore.

We have raised that there are many groups for whom work was a reason to get vaccinated, as they're employed within the care sector, and I represent those who were healthcare workers within the NHS, some worked in schools and other public institutions. All were made aware that their job would be at risk if they did not have the vaccine. They were asked to do so and asked to put their own health at risk and the health of others before their own.

We are concerned that there were methods used by the government, the NHS and private companies to ensure that all employees were vaccinated, and this may have had the desired effect for some people, who responded to the campaigns by getting vaccinated, but we ask at what cost to the individual, to the employer's work environment and to society as a whole?

It's crucial for the Inquiry to explore how VCOD, its causal impacts, affected individual decisions, potentially causing them to prioritise external pressures over their own health needs. It will also be important for the Inquiry to examine the degree to which the Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish and Westminster governments differed in their position and messaging to their populations around whether vaccines were mandatory.

Within our groups there are also numerous doctors within the NHS who had concerns about the vaccine but were instructed to keep those concerns from the public, including their own patients. This form of censorship, which we will term "cultural censorship", is deeply troubling. It has forced doctors to hide their own injuries even now. These doctors, who are often responsible for administering the vaccine to others, faced immense pressure to receive it themselves and, despite their enhanced understanding of their own bodies and the potential impact of the vaccine, they very often felt compelled to prioritise external pressures.

And this leads to my third issue, that of reporting of vaccine injury.

The Inquiry's consistently stated that the operation of post-approval monitoring system and how relevant bodies identified and responded to reports is within its scope and we're grateful for that reiteratation this morning. But in our submission the scope of the Inquiry so also include whether the healthcare system was adequately prepared to properly identify, monitor and report vaccine injury.

Medical professionals should have been provided with information and treatment protocols about possible suspicious side effects to look out for before the first vaccines were administered. Side effects were anticipated. Medical staff should have been given directives which required them to identify any conditions which appeared following vaccinations and to immediately report these for best treatment protocols and for data collection of emerging side effects, for example via the Yellow Card scheme.

Those we represent also express genuine concern that vaccine injuries among individuals from minority communities may have gone unreported due to structural discrimination. This is likely to translate into an incomplete understanding of national vaccine injury incidents, any relevant data analysis by ethnicity or other protected characteristic, and this undermines any proper understanding of risks for future mass vaccination programmes.

In our submission, any effort to address vaccine safety remains incomplete without consideration of factors such as discrimination hindered certain groups from effectively reporting vaccine-related injuries.

The bereaved that we represent also have serious concerns about how the deaths of their loved ones following a vaccine injury were investigated and recorded. Hospitals, GPs and coroners were not adequately prepared to fully investigate deaths where bereaved raised concerns about a connection with the vaccine, in our submission.

This is vital. Given the importance of accurate reporting of deaths caused by the vaccine by the ONS and other data and statistical bodies, the Inquiry should, in our submission, examine these post-death processes carefully, with a view to making recommendations that will ensure a more robust and compassionate reporting system for the future.

Compassion must be something, in our submission, the Inquiry takes seriously, which leads me on to my fourth topic on scope: the provision of medical, psychological and financial support to the vaccine injured and bereaved.

Mr Keith has said this morning that the treatment of the vaccine injured is not something that Module 4 is looking at and that it would represent a massive expansion in terms of reference, and that its treatment is only tangentially connected to the broader issues which lie at the heart of this module.

We respectfully disagree.

It's clear, in our submission, that rapid diagnosis is important for accurate vaccine safety tracking, which benefits the whole of society and not just the individual patient. If there is no care diagnostic pathway, there is no efficient reporting. It is not tangential, in our submission.

Proper diagnosis and treatment of the vaccine injured should be at the heart of the reporting of vaccine injury, and also part of the examination of the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. Put simply, my Lady, if people do not believe there is adequate care in place for the vaccine injured, it will impact on their confidence in reporting vaccine injury and it will impact on their confidence in having future vaccines. The Yellow Card system and other reporting systems are intertwined with diagnosis and care by doctors.

In our submission, the Inquiry should investigate why the government did not adequately plan for clear diagnostic pathways to ensure people were treated quickly and that appropriate medical and emotional support was provided promptly across the country to all those who needed it.

As part of the risk assessment, what were the known risks? Was that risk assessment adequate? And if there were known risks of injury or death, what were the risk mitigations put into place? That mitigation, a horrible word as it may sound, should have taken the form of proper diagnosis and treatment for those who were vaccine injured.

Mr Keith has said this morning that the Inquiry has to draw a line and that the issue of whether or not there has been any psychological trauma is not something the Inquiry could possibly look at. Again, we respectfully disagree and urge you, my Lady, to recognise that understanding the trauma of vaccine injury and bereavement is the only way of understanding the significance of poor reporting and the inadequacies of the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme.

My fifth issue, my Lady, in respect of scope is that of discrimination. I have sought to interweave some of my submissions into my other submissions on scope, but may I just deal shortly with a point raised by Mr Keith this morning in relation to the reintroduction of the evidence from Professors Nazroo and Bécares from Module 2, and I wanted to echo and support Ms Munroe's submissions that Module 4 and looking at discrimination is not a simple check list or tick box exercise; any evidence that looks at structural discrimination must address the fundamental issues that each module is tackling.

Finally then in terms of scope, the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. In our written submissions we propose that the Inquiry obtain expert evidence on the scheme and use a comparative approach with other no fault payment schemes developed in other countries.

We've noted that a Rule 9 statement has been requested from Professor Duncan Fairgrieve KC. There was some suggestion this morning by Mr Keith that he may not need to be called but we would wish to revisit this position, if in fact that is the position, once we have sight from his Rule 9 statement. In our submission, he is an expert and it's likely to be our subsequent submission that he be treated as such.

Still on this topic, it's important to underline at this stage that the vaccine adverse impacted and bereaved do not have any confidence that outside this Inquiry that comments made by the current government regarding reform to the VDPS will result in any meaningful change. Their concern is that it's an easy election promise that will not materialise into any formal review. This Inquiry, now seized of the issue within Module 4, must be, we say, the robust independent investigation that makes clear recommendations for any government to act upon.

We've seen this week in the Langstaff Inquiry into the infected blood scandal making interim recommendations for compensation, now a recommendation urgent establishment of a compensation scheme for those victims, which the government has said it will honour. This underlines that public inquiries have a significant role to play in establishing the truth, away from party politics, and making concrete recommendations that governments take action.

The victims of the infected blood scandal had to campaign for decades to achieve justice, decades of physical and mental suffering for patients and their families to obtain recognition, treatment and compensation. We ask this Inquiry to prevent the groups I represent from going through the same tortured experience.

May I then move on to some submissions on the instructions of experts, and I can take this quite shortly. In our written submissions we have proposed a number of additional experts for the Inquiry to seek evidence from, and we have also requested that each of the experts already instructed be provided with copies of the statements provided to the Inquiry by each of our groups.

Impact evidence. We've heard this morning that impact evidence from representative witnesses on behalf of appropriate core participants may be called, as it was in Module 2. It's firmly submitted that it's impossible to comprehend the impact of the pandemic without understanding the impact of the vaccine. Absent the insights of our groups, an accurate depiction will not be possible. It's an uncomfortable truth for many, but vaccine injury and death are, very sadly, a part of the pandemic story.

My Lady, you said in 2022 that loss and suffering would be at the heart of your Inquiry. Prior to that, on 11 August 2021, the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote a letter to a VIBUK member which read:

"I am deeply sorry to read about Jamie's condition and the immense consequences for you. You have suffered a heartbreaking and frightening change, but I would like to pay attribute to your strength in proposing changes which you think could improve the situation. You're not a statistic and must not be ignored. I am deeply touched by your story."

This Inquiry has a unique opportunity to ensure that the Covid vaccine adverse reaction and bereaved are not ignored. To not hear evidence from them as part of the oral evidence hearings would be to simply reduce them to an inaccurate and under-reported statistic. This Inquiry cannot allow this to happen and we say that they must be included with the witnesses that the Inquiry hears from.

Which leads me on to censorship. My Lady, to exclude the groups that I represent would add to the extensive censorship they already experience. The Covid Vaccine Adverse Reaction and Bereaved have been largely ignored by public services, with their experiences not recognised or validated by those who should be in a position to help them.

This censorship manifests itself in our clients' engagement with this Inquiry. YouTube removed a video of my oral submissions to you, my Lady, on the last occasion, in September of last year, and despite requests for a thorough review by our clients, YouTube cited a violation on its medical misinformation policy as grounds for removal.

Sadly, this incident of censorship is not an isolated occurrence but rather a part of a broader pattern of treatment our clients have endured. Such censorship not only stifles the voices of those directly affected but also sends a chilling message to potential witnesses who may consider sharing evidence that is critical of the vaccine from their own lived experience.

The fear of reprisal, whether in the form of censorship, social backlash or professional repercussions looms large for individuals who may have valuable insights to contribute to this Inquiry. This fear may lead individuals to hesitate or withhold candid evidence, undermining the Inquiry's own integrity and depriving it of the diverse perspectives necessary for a comprehensive examination of the issues.

Addressing censorship is crucial not only to protect the rights of those affected but also to foster an environment where individuals feel safe, their experiences openly and honestly expressed within this inquiry and elsewhere. It is imperative therefore that individuals providing evidence feel confident they will not face repercussions for their evidence and that it is valued by the Inquiry.

To restore confidence in the Inquiry process, our clients respectfully request you, my Lady, to establish a clear protocol for reporting to you any instances of Inquiry material being removed from social media and reporting any incidents of reprisal to those who have provided evidence to the Inquiry, which, in my submission, my Lady, are essential for you to ensure the independence and credibility of your Inquiry and the evidence it hears.

I'll move on, then, please, to some shorter topics.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm afraid I'm going to hurry you, Ms Morris, I did give everyone a warning earlier.

**Ms Morris**: You did, my Lady.

Disclosure, my Lady, I won't repeat what's in my written submissions. Likewise parliamentary privilege.

My Lady, you have my submissions in respect of support for my clients during the oral evidence hearings, and I'm grateful for the provision that's been provided today. It's just a recognition that there are certain issues around light sensitivity, chemicals and water filtration and frequent breaks.

My Lady, I have sought to elicit the key points from our written submissions, which we have no doubt you have read in full, and I commend them fully to you. But in short, and in conclusion, this Inquiry has a historic opportunity to critically examine and record the facts about the Covid-19 vaccine. It cannot simply accept the pandemic narratives perpetuated during an unprecedented period to ensure maximum compliance. This thorough examination must include facts and evidence that are uncomfortable for some but are a reality for many. This Inquiry must carefully listen and meticulously record them and have the courage to make recommendations for reform.

My Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Morris.

I will not have applause. I appreciate how people care about this issue, but I'm afraid this is a formal hearing of a statutory inquiry. So can I just make that plain.

Right, Ms Banton, will you take us up to lunch, please.
