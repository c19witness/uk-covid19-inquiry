5. Submissions on Behalf of Scottish Covid Bereaved by Mr Mccaffery
===================================================================

**Mr McCaffery**: Thank you, my Lady.

I'm instructed by the Inquiries team at Aamer Anwar & Company to make oral submissions on behalf of Scottish Covid Bereaved, and I am accompanied today by Ms Murray and Ms McQuade.

Scottish Covid Bereaved are once again grateful to the Inquiry for being included as a designated core participant in Module 4. Further, we are grateful to Counsel to the Inquiry for providing his detailed note setting out the matters which are to be addressed at today's second preliminary hearing.

Scottish Covid Bereaved have, of course, already submitted written submissions and we trust that those brief submissions, together with today's oral submissions, will be of assistance to the Inquiry in respect of making progress towards the evidential hearings scheduled for January 2025.

Following Counsel to the Inquiry's outline order of submissions, those on behalf of Scottish Covid Bereaved are as follows: in terms of scope, my Lady, the intended scope of Module 4 is encouraging, together with the fact that it will also look at medications and treatment of Covid-19 in tandem with the vaccine programme, hopefully to better inform future preparedness for the next pandemic.

Members of Scottish Covid Bereaved particularly welcome the examination of thematic issues, unequal vaccine uptake, its causes, concerns about vaccine safety and the redress scheme are all shared concerns of Scottish Covid Bereaved members, and how the UK and devolved governments responded to those issues. However, we note Counsel to the Inquiry's submissions this morning in that regard.

It is hoped that examination of all these issues will include aspects particularly relevant to Scotland, and shared to a large extent with our Welsh and Northern Irish neighbours, of the added difficulties arising out of the geography of our respective nations and the rural nature of many of our communities.

Concerns raised by our members include scenarios where members of traditionally isolated communities, especially those who might have been shielding, either for themselves or for family members, were often required to potentially sacrifice the protection which that feature of their communities naturally afforded them by being asked to attend at large vaccination centres, with all of the associated potential risks of transmission which inevitably went with that, in most cases, having to travel significant distances to attend, then congregating and queuing -- albeit social distanced it would be hoped -- with large groups of potentially infected people, when local GP surgeries and other small clinics might have been a better, safer and more familiar and thus much less stressful environment to deliver the programme in such areas.

Other areas of concern are the lack of provision of vaccines to some frontline workers in the early stages of its availability during the pandemic, issues which arose with vaccine distribution and inevitable wastage, and whether these were handled as expediently as they could have been, all of which has led some to question if decisions were made perhaps more for political reasons rather than clinical.

Was the race to produce one of the first vaccines purely to gain a march on the pandemic or was it politically motivated to divert from what was a tumultuous political time for the nation?

Albeit the scope of the Inquiry will not and, indeed, probably could not be expected to extend to the safety of specific vaccines or quantification of the precise risks of vaccination, the recent withdrawal of the AstraZeneca vaccine from production does raise concerns, particularly in light of the acknowledged issues which that vaccine had.

Accordingly, we welcome the Inquiry's intention to examine vaccine safety issues and particularly the suggested correlation between Covid-19 vaccines and cardiovascular issues. However, we note that the suggested correlation as referred to by Counsel to the Inquiry appears now to be a matter of admission of fact on the part of that particular vaccine manufacturer, who has admitted as a fact that their vaccine was linked to the rare and serious side effect of causing rare blood clots or thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which can cause long-term disability and death.

We are reassured by Mr Keith's further submissions in those regards this morning.

As we note in our written submissions, it is welcomed that the spread of conspiracy theories and anti-vaccination groups through disinformation is also to be considered, as this was concerning not simply because the content was widely disseminated but on whether enough was done to counter such spread by way of expert information being published on social media to offer the public a balanced pool of information, thus allowing them to make an informed choice and thereby promoting trust in the safety of vaccines and in our public services.

Scottish Covid Bereaved are further encouraged to read your Ladyship's ruling following the first preliminary hearing in Module 4, on 13 September 2023, and particularly the final paragraph thereof, that the Inquiry may, where it deems it to be of assistance to do so, seek evidence from those members of core participant groups who may be able to speak to the impact of the decisions which were made at both UK and devolved levels.

The wide membership of Scottish Covid Bereaved and the professional experience which many of those members bring to the group means that it is well placed as a core participant to offer assistance to the Inquiry in relation to the vaccine roll-out, the availability of vaccines or lack thereof, and how that affected vulnerable groups, particularly the elderly and those vulnerable due to comorbidities, others affected by particular physical or mental health issues, those who were in ethnic groups or who had lost a partner of a different ethnicity, or some who were simply traditionally distrustful or suspicious of authority and the difficulties which were experienced in Scotland during that process.

The issues surrounding the development, testing and eventual roll-out of vaccines were obviously critical issues in terms of lifting of restrictions imposed by lockdown and allowing families to return to levels of interaction so critical for those vulnerable groups through age, illness and/or physical and mental health disabilities. We acknowledge the terms of paragraph 18 of Counsel to the Inquiry's note in respect of eligibility and priority for vaccination and welcome that inclusion.

A further concern was whether there was any attempt to research then match particular vaccines with certain groups in society.

On Rule 9 requests, my Lady, we have nothing other to suggest in respect of these than simply to note that, as with previous preliminary hearings in other modules, the scope of the module is, of course, necessarily provisional at this stage, and much will depend on the evidence and material obtained during the Rule 9 procedure, as reflected in Counsel to the Inquiry's note.

It is therefore to be hoped that recovery and disclosure continue at a pace to allow sufficient time for preparation for the Module 4 hearing in January 2025. We appreciate the considerable efforts of the Solicitor to the Inquiry's team in that task that they are dealing with.

We are also mindful of the invitation to advance suggestions as to additional recipients of Rule 9 requests once we become aware of those already in receipt of same.

Parliamentary privilege, as concerns that we state in our written submissions that we have no additional observations in this regard, and the process in place appears to be working well.

Disclosure to core participants, again as already observed in respect of Rule 9 requests, and as Ms Munroe King's Counsel has already flagged up, not wishing to sound like a broken record, the sooner disclosure can be made the more preparation time will be afforded to core participants for the hearings which are now not that far off in the future.

We also look forward to receiving the further statements which have already been received in draft form once these have been finalised.

In respect of expert witnesses, my Lady, we note the instruction of the experts referred to in Counsel to the Inquiry's note and await receipt of those notes in due course. We will doubtless have further submissions to make in that regard at the next scheduled preliminary hearing in October, if indeed that is required.

Again, Every Story Matters, we look forward to receipt of the Module 4 report in this regard when available.

As far as timetabling is concerned, we await receipt of the provisional lists of witnesses and issues and the proposals for the Rule 10 process and responding to those in due course.

We note the third preliminary hearing may be held in October 2024 if required and the planned hearing dates of 14 to 30 January 2025.

Finally, my Lady, we look forward to continuing to operate with and assist the Inquiry are Module 4, as we hope that we have been able to do so far with other modules.

Those are my submissions on behalf of Scottish Covid Bereaved, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr McCaffery.

**Mr McCaffery**: I'm obliged, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Wilcock, I appreciate you hadn't asked to make oral submissions. I take it that on behalf of Northern Ireland you associate yourself with the comments made by Ms Munroe earlier, and of course I have your written missions?

**Mr Wilcock**: Indeed, and for those two reasons we decided to say nothing, but I'm grateful to you for giving me the opportunity of explaining to my clients why that was.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Mr Wagner.
