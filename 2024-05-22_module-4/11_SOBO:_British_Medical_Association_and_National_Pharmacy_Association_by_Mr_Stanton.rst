11. Submissions on Behalf of the British Medical Association and National Pharmacy Association by Mr Stanton
===========================================================================================================

**Mr Stanton**: Yes, thank you, my Lady.

I have two short submissions on behalf of the British Medical Association and National Pharmacy Association, which are both concerned with delivery of the vaccination programme. There are some areas of overlap, but in the main they highlight separate issues for inclusion and examination within the Module 4 hearings.

Taking the BMA first, the BMA views the Covid-19 vaccination programme as one of the biggest successes of the pandemic response, in large part due to the efforts of healthcare workers, including non-clinical staff and also volunteers. General practice in particular played a key role and, in England, a significant majority of vaccines were administered by GPs and community pharmacies.

The unprecedented scale of the vaccination programme saved countless lives and enabled the beginnings of a return to business as usual healthcare. A study by the World Health Organisation, published earlier this year on 13 January, provides estimates for the number of lives directly saved by Covid-19 vaccination programmes in the European region between December 2020 and March 2023. It estimates that vaccination in the UK reduced mortality by 70% in adults aged 25 and over, and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. It also found that countries that implemented vaccination programmes early, such as the UK, saw the greatest benefit in terms of the number of lives saved overall through vaccination.

However, despite the success of the programme, there are some significant areas of learning for the future. Insufficient consideration was given to workforce planning. The delivery of the vaccination programme further reduced already limited workforce capacity with healthcare workers, including GPs, who were required to work additional hours to administer vaccinations whilst still continuing to deliver Covid and non-Covid care. These pressures, over prolonged periods, led to stress, burn-out and fatigue. A GP from Northern Ireland commented in response to a BMA survey:

"We have been stretched so thin covering Covid centres and also delivering vaccination programmes, this has had a huge impact on our staff."

The BMA has asked the Inquiry to include consideration of levels of staffing for future vaccination programmes, to ensure sufficient declaratory relief capacity in the system and safe working environments, and we're grateful to you and to Mr Keith for the indication given earlier today that this issue is being pursued.

There were also challenges for clinicians in respect of the IT structure used, for example, the Covid-19 vaccination system was not immediately or easily operable with existing GP IT systems. There were also different booking systems operated by GPs on the one hand and community pharmacy and vaccination centres on the other, leading to double bookings, unattended appointments and wastage of valuable vaccinations.

In early 2021, concern was raised by BMA members about irregular and insufficient supplies of Covid-19 vaccinations for patients, which resulted in the need to reschedule appointments due to failed deliveries. These problems were further compounded by the fact that any additional doses left over at the end of a session were not authorised to be administered to anyone outside specified eligible groups. BMA members reported widely that vaccine doses were being discarded if first dose appointments could not be fulfilled rather than being administered as a second dose to available healthcare staff or other frontline workers, because of the unnecessarily strict policy relating to dosage intervals, which stated that second vaccine doses would be audited to ensure that no second doses were administered prior to the 12-week interval.

Later NHS England introduced a golden rule not to waste a dose, which allowed vaccinators more flexibility in the provision of vaccines. The BMA suggests that the Inquiry examines this issue in detail in the Module 4 hearings.

My Lady, prior to the Covid-19 vaccination programme, it was known via studies on vaccination intention and learning from other vaccination programmes that there may be lower rates of uptake of vaccines among ethnic minority groups. Given this knowledge, the BMA believes that the potential risk of disparity in vaccine uptake should have been better anticipated. People from ethnic minority groups and deprived communities also had worse health outcomes before the pandemic, and with this in mind there should have been greater consideration of these groups in the planning of the vaccine roll-out.

It will also be important to consider the effectiveness of public communications in addressing barriers to vaccine uptake, including within specific groups. For example, there was significant confusion about the safety of the vaccine among those who were pregnant or considering pregnancy, and some instances where individuals who were pregnant and wanted to be vaccinated were unable to do so. This confusion should have been avoided through clear, early advice and guidance, as people who were pregnant were at higher risk of severe disease from Covid-19. However, it wasn't until April 2021 that the government clarified its advice, confirming the safety of the vaccine in pregnancy and its effects on fertility.

My Lady, the BMA hopes that these short submissions will assist in highlighting areas of focus for the Inquiry, all of which are more fully expanded in the BMA's written statement recently submitted to the Inquiry.

Turning to the National Pharmacy Association, in common with the BMA they consider the Covid vaccination programme to have been broadly successful, again in large part due to the efforts of the healthcare workers involved in administering vaccinations, together with the many people who made significant commitments and contributions as volunteers.

Within the written statement of the NPA's vice chair, Olivier Picard, there is an account of the experience of setting up a vaccination centre which includes reference to the fact that he and his pharmacy colleagues worked together alongside surgeons, doctors, nurses and paramedics, and that they enjoyed an unparalleled sense of unity and co-operation as healthcare workers.

The vaccination programme was widely recognised by communities across the UK as the way out of restrictions, and the NPA would encourage the Inquiry to consider ways in which the contribution of volunteers within their communities can be reflected.

In Mr Picard's statement, he describes how, on 23 December 2020, he reached out to his local community via social media to seek help in acquiring premises from which to run a vaccination centre and by the next day, which was Christmas Eve, he had received numerous offers, including from a local IT company that allowed him to operate the centre from their premises free of charge.

Shortly afterwards, he reached out again, this time on Boxing Day, to seek the help of volunteers in running the vaccination centre, and within just two days he had received over 600 offers of assistance.

Reflecting on this experience, Mr Picard remarks:

"I have never seen a community come together like this before, nor have I ever been involved in anything that meant so much to so many people at the same time."

That said, similar to the BMA submissions, the NPA considers that there are some aspects of the programme that can be improved upon.

The most significant of these for the NPA are as follows. First, planning. Community pharmacy should have been consulted and involved earlier in the planning process, particularly given its years of experience and expertise in delivering the annual influenza vaccination programmes, and the reach and resources of the 14,000 community pharmacies across the UK, which are firmly embedded at the heart of their communities. Instead, community pharmacy was initially given a gap in service role, which failed to fully utilise their experience, expertise and resource.

In England, the arbitrary and unnecessary early requirements of having the capacity to deliver 1,000 vaccinations per week and to open 12 hours a day, seven days a week prevented many community pharmacies who desperately wanted to help from participating because they didn't have the physical space or personnel to deliver this number and to remain open for the hours required.

It is acknowledged that lessons were learned as the programme progressed, and from just six pharmacy-led participants in January 2021, community pharmacy was able to increase its contribution to 500 pharmacies by June 2021, and by 2023 almost half of vaccinations were being administered by community pharmacy.

It is acknowledged also that the programme was delivered at unprecedented pace, and that the priority was to administer the largest number of vaccinations as quickly as possible, but still the potential of the community pharmacy network was not recognised or utilised early enough.

My Lady, regarding the use of existing healthcare infrastructure and resources, the Inquiry is invited to consider whether this failure in respect of community pharmacy is part of a broader tendency, seen also during the pandemic in the failure to properly harness the potential of local public health services, to overlook existing NHS resource and expertise in favour of the creation of expensive temporary systems and services with little lasting utility.

In this respect, it's important that the community pharmacy network is not taken for granted. Due to financial pressures, they are currently closing at the rate of ten per week, and maintenance of the community pharmacy network will be essential to ensure a permanent accessible resource for the delivery of future vaccination programmes.

The second point relates to operational challenges. As already mentioned in the BMA's submission, probably the biggest operational problem encountered was the disjointed booking systems, with pharmacies and vaccination centres required to use one system while GPs had to use a separate system. This led, as already mentioned, to large numbers of double bookings, failures to attend appointments, and the wasting of valuable vaccinations.

There were also operational problems with the provision of PPE, high levels of unnecessary administration, and poor communications.

The third point is vaccine hesitancy and inequalities. The significance of these issues was not appreciated early enough, and nor was the positive role that community pharmacy was able to play in addressing them. Community pharmacies are trusted healthcare settings at the heart of their local communities, ideally placed to respond to the needs and concerns of their patients. Community pharmacy is also disproportionately located in poorer areas, and it played a significant role in addressing health inequalities.

Together with Doctors of the World and NHS England, the NPA launched a toolkit to support its members to provide open access vaccination clinics to provide vaccinations for those with insecure NHS status and hard to reach groups, including asylum seekers and the homeless.

Governments did come to recognise the value of community pharmacy in addressing issues of equality and vaccine hesitancy, but again this recognition should have been sooner, and there should have been earlier and more comprehensive consultation with community pharmacy on these issues.

Finally, my Lady, the Inquiry will be taking account of the impact of the pandemic on healthcare workers within Module 3, and the NPA suggests that it will also be helpful to reflect on these impacts within Module 4. Healthcare workers who were working in a system already stretched to breaking point provided crucial vaccination services on top of existing commitments, many working almost continuously with little sleep or time to spend with their families. This is not a sustainable model for the delivery of future vaccination services.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Stanton, very grateful.

Do you have anything by way of reply, Mr Keith?
