10. Submissions on Behalf of the Traveller Movement by Mr Jacobs
================================================================

**Mr Jacobs**: My Lady, I appear for the Traveller Movement and I'm instructed by Howe & Co.

As we've set out in our written submissions, the Traveller Movement is a charity which represents the interests of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities -- I'll refer to them as GRT -- in the United Kingdom. It was designated as a core participant in this phase of this Inquiry on 17 July 2023.

Traveller Movement's position is that the GRT population in the United Kingdom was largely ignored in the vaccine roll-out programme during the Covid-19 pandemic. And this is a matter of concern because, as we told the Inquiry I think back in September at the last preliminary hearing, the population of those communities has been estimated by the ONS as potentially as high as 500,000 people, so up to one in ten of the population.

Now, there are a number of reasons why such large numbers of GRT were disregarded in the pandemic. Many of them, around 10,000, are forced to live on unauthorised sites as a result of failure by local authorities to meet their spatial planning duties, and such people were unable to register with GPs or access the vaccine programme through the medical authorities.

There's also the question of digital exclusion. Only one in five GRT has access to the internet.

My Lady, also it's right to say that large numbers of Travellers were unsure about the health effects of vaccines and reluctant to engage with the programme because the messages that were circulated by the authorities didn't address their particular concerns. Traveller Movement says that there was no culturally sensitive education on vaccines given to GRT people.

Yet, my Lady, possibly the greatest reason why GRT suffered from unequal vaccine uptake is the institutional and societal discrimination, the long-term oppression that this group has faced over many generations.

I sit with Martin Howe and Aylin Howe of Howe & Co today, and they tell me that Howe & Co are currently acting for hundreds of Travellers who have been refused access to restaurants, public houses and holiday camps. All routine events in the lives of GRT members: they're told they can't come in because they're Travellers. So Travellers are culturally conditioned to being marginalised; consequently and unsurprisingly, they are distrustful of the authorities in the United Kingdom.

The Traveller Movement says all of this should have been known, it should have been acted upon, yet no adequate adjustments were made during the vaccination programme to account for these cultural trust issues which were clearly a barrier to vaccination uptake.

The experience of many Travellers, and we've spoken to one particular member of the community, during the pandemic is that, instead of any guidance or assistance, the only interaction with the authorities that Travellers experienced took the form of heavy police presence at funerals, in circumstances, in many cases, where the numbers of police officers were often greater than the number of mourners.

So the GRT community was seen as problems, law enforcement problems, and not as a vulnerable community in great need of support and help.

We anticipate and hope that the Inquiry will receive impact evidence from Travellers on these relevant issues. We say it's very important that the Inquiry looks into all of these issues in relation to this community, not least because the de facto exclusion of such large numbers of people from a vaccination programme did and would undermine the integrity of any national vaccination programme.

The emerging picture from the evidence disclosed thus far is supportive of Traveller Movement's position. Howe & Co have looked at some of the documents and it's clear at this preliminary stage that there was a degree of institutional acceptance during the pandemic that GRT, particularly those who led nomadic lifestyles, found it more challenging to reach vaccine centres and GPs.

Furthermore, the evidence shows that vaccine uptake for GRT in the 12-15-year age bracket was particularly low and fell below 30%. We say it's very important that the Inquiry experts address the particular barriers faced by GRT people in relation to vaccine uptake during the Covid-19 pandemic. Those experts should go on to consider whether the government planned and responded to the particular situation that this group faced.

Moving on to expert evidence. My Lady, we note that the Inquiry has instructed or is in the process of instructing Professor Kasstan-Dabush and Dr Chantler to deal with the issues of vaccine roll-out. They will also look at existing inequalities and structural discrimination. Professor Heidi Larson, along with other experts, will look at vaccine hesitancy and misinformation.

Our primary submission in relation to these experts is their instructions must make it clear that they are to consider the particular cases of GRT communities, not just generically minority groups. There are separate issues for separate minority groups and communities.

We have heard what Mr Keith King's Counsel said this morning, that the experts will not deal with barriers to uptake as a discrete issue or the Inquiry won't do that as suggested by the Traveller Movement. We respectfully disagree with this approach, but if the die is cast on this point and the Inquiry's not going to look to look at barriers as a discrete issue, we ask that the experts are instructed to deal with barriers to uptake in detail.

Notwithstanding that there will be expert evidence from the Inquiry's own experts, we additionally maintain that focused evidence might be needed because the NHS does not record GRT in its data directory, so the impact of Covid-19 on this group is not easily seen from statistics.

We remind the Inquiry that at the previous preliminary hearing we suggested that the Inquiry calls evidence from witnesses who can speak as to the barriers that GRT people faced in relation to the vaccination programme. We suggested Mary Foy MP, who is the co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on GRT, Dr Pauline Lane from the faculty of health education, medicine and social care at Anglia Ruskin University, and Yvonne MacNamara, who is the director of the Traveller Movement. These people would be well suited to assisting the Inquiry in this regard.

In relation to timescales, we've heard what Mr Keith has said today but we respectfully submit that 10 to 11 days of evidence, if I've recalled it correctly, is unrealistic for an inquiry of this kind, and we do urge that you reconsider. It's very often in other inquiries witnesses have to come back the next day or be rescheduled. It is a very short timescale for an inquiry with so many core participants and so many important issues.

Quickly on parliamentary privilege, in our speaking note we've said that the Traveller Movement would wish to rely on evidence given by a GRT group in the House of Commons to a select committee in July 2020. That evidence highlighted a number of problems that the Traveller community faced during lockdown.

Now, the Traveller Movement doesn't want to be constrained by parliamentary privilege if it wants to go further than merely relying on such evidence for fact and context, and we accept that the issue is difficult and complex, but we agree that there may be some need for an Inquiry protocol, we agree with Ms Naik of King's Counsel, and some legal argument might be needed at some stage, and of course -- as you've indicated -- if you have to. There may come a time in which core participants may be compromised or prejudiced potentially by a lack of clarity in this area but, as you've stated, this matter has been flagged and I'm just perhaps reflagging it.

My Lady, to conclude, we submit the Inquiry must take steps to ensure that there is sufficient evidence and in particular expert evidence for it that relates to the plight of GRT in the Covid-19 pandemic. It's only through doing this that the Inquiry can fulfil aim 2 of its terms of reference: to identify the lessons to be learned and inform preparations for future pandemics across the UK.

We also submit that the Inquiry should take steps to ensure it meets its obligation under paragraph A of those terms to consider any disparities, evidence on different categories of people, including those who have protected characteristics under the Equalities Act 2010.

The primary concern of TM is that if this Inquiry is not in the position to make robust findings and recommendations, there is a real risk that GRT will again be ignored, misunderstood or discriminated against in any vaccine roll-out programme in a future pandemic.

My Lady, they were the forgotten people in the Covid pandemic, they were invisible to policymakers and providers. Traveller Movement's position is that this must not happen again.

My Lady, there is a final point, and we appreciate that you may well be inundated with procedural matters, however, we request that Traveller Movement's section 40 funding application is moved up to the top of your Ladyship's to-do list. Can we also ask that it is underlined and highlighted on that list. Those who instruct me are very anxious to begin the work of preparing for the hearings in January 2025, and wish to assist the Inquiry in its important work. A brief check of the documents now disclosed shows that over 4,000 documents concern the Traveller communities. My Lady, January will soon be upon us and there is substantial work to be done. You will appreciate that it's important that those who instruct me are in a position where they are properly funded and able to start this work soon.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Jacobs.

Mr Stanton, I think you're the last to speak.

**Mr Stanton**: Yes, my Lady, thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: And wearing two hats, I think.
