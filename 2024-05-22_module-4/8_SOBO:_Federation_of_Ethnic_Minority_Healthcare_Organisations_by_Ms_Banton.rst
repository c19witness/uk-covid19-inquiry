8. Submissions on Behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations by Ms Banton
===================================================================================================

**Ms Banton**: My Lady, good afternoon. I, along with the counsel team of Mr Philip Dayle, Mr Ifeanyi Odogwu --

**Lady Hallett**: Is your microphone on?

**Ms Banton**: No, it's not -- it's on now, I think.

**Lady Hallett**: It is now.

**Ms Banton**: That's much better.

Good afternoon, my Lady. I along with a counsel team of Mr Philip Dayle, Mr Ifeanyi Odogwu and Ms Una Morris, represent the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations, FEMHO. We are led by Mr Leslie Thomas KC and instructed by Cyrilia Knight and Isabel Gregory of Saunders Law.

FEMHO is the voice for a large multidisciplinary consortium advocating on behalf of ethnically diverse black, Asian and minority ethnic health and social care workers.

FEMHO remains steadfastly clear in its intention to address inequalities and indeed inequities experienced by ethnic minorities within health and social care in the United Kingdom.

My Lady, I am most grateful that many of the factors that we have raised previously have been incorporated and for the opportunity to address you today. We have provided submissions in writing and I will highlight some aspects now.

As my Lady is aware, FEMHO's client base is made up of highly skilled and knowledgeable healthcare workers involved at the coalface of the roll-out of vaccines and treatment of Covid, and so it is helpful to provide their insights at this juncture.

Providing the ethnic minority healthcare perspective, FEMHO is able to speak to how the workforce culture of the public health and coronavirus response structures impacted disproportionately harshly on minority ethnic healthcare workers, including in respect of discrimination, disproportionate rostering to high risk areas, inadequate PPE, lack of risk assessment, lack of proper epidemiological data, mapping and more.

Moving on to update on scope, which is the most substantial of my submissions. On the provisional scope outlined, FEMHO particularly welcomes the assurance that the Inquiry will expressly address the impact of all decisions on marginalised groups and communities. We welcome coverage as to whether VCOD was or would have been effective in limiting transmission and its impact on vaccine hesitancy or lack of confidence. We note that regarding VCOD, care workers were treated differently and that VCOD continued to operate within that sector.

We are also most grateful that our concerns made at the last preliminary hearing regarding the use of terminology that better reflects the sensitivities and complexities of the issues at play have also been addressed.

FEMHO note and are encouraged by the Yellow Card scheme and UK Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme being included. We welcome the commitment to place possible inequalities at the forefront of this investigation, which we believe must involve an unflinching and thorough exploration of whether institutional and structural racism and inequality played a part in the development, procurement and use of Covid-19 therapeutics and vaccines, including the employment implementation of the vaccine roll-out programme.

Regarding crucial exploration through an inequality lens, as Counsel to the Inquiry referred to this morning, we hope it will be helpful to provide a few illustrative examples of the approach we submit should be taken towards this investigation.

We consider it vital that the examination of the development, trialling and procurement of Covid-19 vaccines and the implementation of the vaccine roll-out programme investigates if and how pre-existing knowledge in the identification of and any pre-emptive and/or mitigating action was taken in respect of ethnic groups which were the subject of unequal uptake, and whether there was sufficient effort to ensure equitable representation and diversity within trials, as well as the position of minority ethnic healthcare workers and/or communities in the light of pre-existing known risk factors. Further, how the consideration of at-risk groups was approached by vaccine manufacturers and decision-makers, including in relation to ethnic minority groups and in relation to other linked vulnerabilities, for example higher rates of conditions such as sickle cell and other clotting diseases.

Further, in considering the issue of vaccine confidence, a careful examination of the multifactorial underlying issues surrounding confidence in black, Asian and minority ethnic healthcare workers and communities to include the extent to which pre-existing knowledge was taken into account and the role which thematic lack of data played and whether data disaggregated by ethnicity was available, collated and analysed to identify disparities and risks, or not, as the case may be. Also: whether the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme has been equitable in its application by reference to data, again disaggregated by ethnicity; accessibility and cultural competence in surveillance, including the Yellow Card scheme and community outreach; and engagement should be examined so that vital recommendations may be made to improve preparedness for any next pandemic.

And when considering the role of communication and messaging, and decisions taken by the Vaccine Taskforce regarding the roll-out: linguistic accessibility, cultural competence, and the approach to dealing with poorer uptake; ensuring accessibility to vaccine centres; the spread of misinformation and the use of the "hard to reach" mantra must be carefully examined, as well as what efforts have continued since the pandemic and may be added to now on how trust can be rebuilt for the future.

Finally, by way of example, it should be recognised that thematic issues of trust run as a thread throughout all of the above matters regarding key issues around engendering, maintaining and rebuilding trust within such communities.

An analogy may be made with the example of the MMR vaccination. If trust is not cultivated and diverse communities are not included in these matters, confidence and take-up will not be improved and an opportunity may be lost.

Moving on to Rule 9 requests, FEMHO requests that the Inquiry reconsiders the position not to disclose Rule 9 requests to core participants in the interests of transparency and more timely and effective participation by CPs. We submit that if this position is not reconsidered, the Inquiry runs the risk of having insufficient time for any gaps within the evidence to be addressed, given the speed of disclosure and the tight timetable that we are all working to.

FEMHO are concerned that from the information we have been provided via update notes from the Inquiry team, inequalities are at times not given sufficient consideration in Rule 9 requests.

Additionally, the subject of inequalities appears notably absent from some significant Rule 9 requests. For example: entry to HM Treasury inequalities were not directly mentioned; entry 4, the Scottish Government, inequalities were not directly mentioned; and entry 6, the same in respect of the Department of Health and Social Care, where inequalities were not directly mentioned.

Further, where inequalities are mentioned, there is often scant detail as to what exactly the recipient is being asked to comment on. Rather, it often appears, as seems to have been the case in previous modules, as a final catch-all topic, for example, the Cabinet Office summary, where inequalities and vaccine safety appeared at the very end.

The same is true of lessons learned, also often seen as a final topic. Such placement raises a concern that insufficient contextual exploration may be being afforded to vital inequality issues, and there's a risk that inequalities may not receive the consideration that it deserves.

FEMHO has specific concerns that opportunities have been lost to ask the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, JCVI. For example, we have indicated previously that we are keen to explore what if any consideration and/or steps were taken by government, in particular the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, to address the points in relation to making the Yellow Card scheme more accessible and effective for ethnic minorities.

FEMHO welcomes the confirmation that impact witnesses from core participants will be called to give evidence at the hearings. However, we urge the Inquiry to prioritise calling a proportionate number of witnesses who are from diverse backgrounds, disciplines, and locations across the UK who can speak to a range of systemic issues relevant to Module 4, as FEMHO members would be more than willing to assist.

We echo submissions from Anna Morris KC on the need for an urgent compensation scheme and recommendations to avoid a repeat of the experiences of victims' long wait in the Infected Blood Inquiry.

Moving on to disclosure, FEMHO welcomes the confirmation that disclosure will continue to be released on an ongoing basis. We respectfully suggest that disclosure may be made incrementally as soon as material becomes available rather than waiting to release it all at once in a single bulk, in order to prevent delays and to enable parties to front load their preparation.

We suggest that failure to adopt this method risks placing concerned CPs in a position where they may be unable to adequately digest, analyse and contribute meaningfully to the hearings. This problem is exacerbated where many CPs will be actively participating in and working on concurrent back-to-back modules.

Moving on to expert witnesses, we would like to reiterate our previous request, also echoed this morning by Allison Munroe KC, that Professor James Nazroo and Dr Laia BÃ©cares be instructed to produce a joint addendum report addressing the race inequality issues pertinent to Module 4. We consider there would be high value in their providing such an addendum report to the Inquiry specifically addressing issues relating to vaccines and therapeutics, and that they should be made available for questions during the evidential hearings in this module.

In the alternative, as a minimum we ask that all experts, including those already identified and any further experts instructed, be explicitly instructed to consider and address inequalities as it pertains to their remit, such as the equity and representation as well as any bias in vaccine and therapeutic development, trials and clinical use, assessment of data on antiviral and other treatments given to ethnic minority populations, and accessibility and cultural competence of messaging in the roll-out and communications and surveillance systems.

We acknowledge and welcome Mr Keith KC's comments this morning in relation to the two sets of experts that have already been instructed to consider issues of inequalities and discrimination. However, as stated in our written submissions, we firmly consider that all experts in Module 4, not just these two experts, should be instructed to cover such issues.

We are grateful for confirmation that the experts on vaccine safety will report on vaccine effectiveness on Long Covid, and the utilisation of Module 2 and 3 expert evidence focused on Long Covid.

Further, we seek confirmation that the other experts will similarly be asked to address the issues detailed in our previous submissions.

It remains crucial regarding lessons learned that the Inquiry examines and embeds further whether, and if so how, structural inequalities and cultural competencies influenced issues such as vaccine roll-out, VCOD and the Yellow Card system alongside other central matters to Module 4. This must be considered together with the extent to which due regard was given to the public sector equality duty to eliminate discrimination and concomitant equality impact assessments undertaken.

The Inquiry, with the assistance of evidence from FEMHO members, will need to grapple with how structural and systemic, economic, political and social factors coalesced to produce these adverse racialised outcomes during the pandemic.

Moving on to timetable of future hearings, despite the CTI's statement that morning, FEMHO does maintain a genuine concern as to the limited time afforded to the evidential hearings for Module 4 given the breadth of the scope and issues to be investigated. We are mindful that with the Inquiry's practice of sitting four days a week and incorporating opening and closing submissions, this would likely leave a mere ten days or so for questioning of witnesses. We respectfully seek that the Inquiry allocates additional days for Module 4 within the Inquiry timetabling.

My Lady, FEMHO appreciates the full consideration of the Chair given to all the matters raised in my submissions. We are grateful for the attention paid to these important matters, and remain hopeful that they will be carefully addressed within the Inquiry process.

Unless I may assist you further, my Lady, those are my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Banton, I'm very grateful.

We'll break now until 2.10.
