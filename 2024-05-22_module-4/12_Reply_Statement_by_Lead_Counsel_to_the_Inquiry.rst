12. Reply Statement by Lead Counsel to the Inquiry
==================================================

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, may I just pick up one or two of the points that have been made.

In relation to Mr Wagner's submissions on behalf of Clinically Vulnerable Families in relation to the risk of therapeutics falling between the cracks, it would be quite impossible to have a module that dealt only with therapeutics, and therefore the split between addressing safety related issues, trials and regulatory approval and such matters in Module 4 and dealing with the operational healthcare aspects of therapeutics in Module 3 is specifically designed to ensure that nothing does fall between the cracks; and those whom Mr Wagner represents are also core participants in Module 3 and, in addition, of course, the way in which the report writing structure will work is that there will be an overlap. So if there are any problems which do arise, they can be accommodated by the Inquiry.

In relation to the submissions to the effect that there should be an expert report in relation to the position of the clinically vulnerable, I would just note that clinical vulnerability is not a protected characteristic. The definition of that unhappy group of people who suffered is that they were clinically vulnerable, and therefore there's no anthropological expertise which we could adduce in order to be able to provide further information to the Inquiry in relation to their position.

Submissions were made as to whether or not you should order there be interim information provided as to the extent to which therapeutics would be addressed in the course of the actual hearing. The way, my Lady, in which the provisional witness list process works is that the core participants will know from the moment that they see the provisional witness list which witnesses are dealing with therapeutics, which with vaccines, and therefore they will know the general division of attention.

Submissions were made in relation to whether or not the targeted disclosure approach was in fact a misstep on the part of the Tribunal, and then it was suggested that the vice of targeted disclosure is that it's disclosure by virtue of themes. It's not. The whole point about targeted disclosure that it ties the disclosure obligation to specific events, key decisions, key issues, so it provides a clearer structure for the material providers to apply by which they can discharge their disclosure obligations. So there's no question of giving them a greater discretion.

May I say something about the submissions from Ms Morris to the effect that the vaccine injured and bereaved fear marginalisation. My Lady, everything that the Inquiry is doing in Module 4 is designed to bring them into the light. That is what our examination of the safety issues and the general impact of vaccinations is all about. I'd like to reassure her that, as you've demonstrated in relation to past modules, this Inquiry will of course be applying a rigorous and critical approach.

Ms Morris also advanced some submissions in relation to impact evidence. May I reiterate that experience from Modules 1 and 2 has shown that the process of calling a representative witness from each of the core participant campaigning groups, if I may call them that, shows that the Inquiry has been provided with extremely powerful, cogent and clear evidence as to the impact in whatever area their evidence concerns; and also, of course, you will be receiving in Module 4 evidence from the Every Story Matters project which brings together data and information on an anonymised basis in relation to the impact of vaccines on the injured and of course the bereaved.

Finally, in relation to the issue of censorship and the important issue that Ms Morris raised concerning the incident, if I may call it that, in which a reporting of this Tribunal's affairs was removed, no court or tribunal can possibly police derivative reporting; no court or tribunal has power over the internet or social media, or can do anything about removal from the internet of second-hand derivative reporting of its affairs. What this Tribunal can do, and does, is provide a livestream of the evidence, and of course, through its own website and YouTube, transcripts and recordings of the evidence that has been given, and no Inquiry can do more than that. It's certainly not open to you to police, in individual cases, instances where internet companies have refused to allow other people to upload to their own accounts derivative reporting of the affairs of this Tribunal.

My Lady, I think those are all the points that I wish to respond on.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Keith, and thank you to everybody for their submissions.

I will consider them all, the oral and the written submissions that I have received, and then I will discuss with Counsel to the Inquiry team and make my decision. I will, if necessary, issue a determination on various aspects, but I wish to emphasise I will only issue a determination if I consider it necessary to the efficient progress of this Inquiry.

Thank you all very much. I think I sit again tomorrow at 10, I think.

**Mr Keith**: Yes, please.
