3. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK by Ms Munroe KC
=====================================================================================

**Ms Munroe**: Good morning, my Lady.

I represent, as you know, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, instructed by Mr Elkan Abrahamson and Nicola Brook, and I'm assisted today by Ms Brook and counsel Ms Kate Stone.

My Lady, I'm grateful that you and the Inquiry team have read the joint written submissions filed on behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK and Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Northern Ireland.

By way of general observations, I obviously will not be reading out those submissions again. Any matters, my Lady, that I don't allude to or emphasise now, it's not because we resile from them or we do not think they are important, but I'm mindful of the time and I seek to highlight only those most pressing matters, particularly in light of what has been said this morning.

My Lady, we've said this before, and I think it's worth repeating again: we of course understand that no one team can and should be expected to have all the answers on how best to proceed, and that collaboration and co-operation are the key here. That leads to better outcomes and assists our families to feel that they are in fact being heard and seen as an essential part of this Inquiry.

My Lady, I hope that any suggestions that we make are taken as constructive ideas and thoughts to enhance the Inquiry both in terms of its investigative process but also its outcomes and recommendations.

With that in mind, I intend to address you on four points, my Lady, and one matter very briefly at the end which we did not mention in our written submissions.

Firstly, scope.

The outline of scope is an area, of course, that is developing. I'm mindful of what has been said this morning. It is evolving and it will therefore be necessary to keep matters under review, particularly having regard to the large volume of material that is yet to be disclosed to the core participants. With that in mind, my Lady, may I just allude to paragraph 5 and 6 of our written document.

In paragraph 5, we reiterate the importance of examining the differences across the UK in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. In our submission guarding against an England-centric approach to these issues is particularly important and we need to be particularly mindful of that, given the limited timeframe of the Module 4 hearings.

On the question that we raised in paragraph 6, where we say that it is important to consider the UK global vaccine inequity alongside the UK's international collaboration in the development and roll-out of vaccines and therapeutics, I note what has been said by Mr Keith King's Counsel in addressing those matters this morning.

Whilst of course the remit of this Inquiry cannot and does not allow for an extensive exploration of international issues, it is self-evident, we say, that a topic such as vaccines and vaccination cannot be solely considered within the confines of national borders. We are not asking for the Inquiry to do that which it cannot do, ie a full-scale international dive into this topic, and we understand that the issue of proportionality is important here. But what we do say, my Lady, is simply this: that there will be instances and areas where it is relevant to look at the international dimension and the impact on the nations of the United Kingdom, and this should not be lost within the scope of this module.

Two, disclosure.

I'm sure during the course of today, my Lady, you will be addressed doubtless times on this issue of disclosure as you have been on numerous occasions in the past. Going first, and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, we reiterate our points that we always do, that early disclosure is essential and important. It is something that we all wish and we will all benefit from. It is nonetheless worth saying again that it is of huge assistance in the proper preparation and the ability for those we represent to effectively participate in the Inquiry process for us to have early and timely disclosure. We do not for a second underestimate the enormity of the task, though, the handling, the marshalling, and the dissemination of the material.

At paragraphs 11 and 12 of our written document, we have set out with some data how, when and the percentages of disclosure during the first two modules. We hope that that's instructive and helpful to look at, because it goes some way to showing how, in terms of percentages, the vast majority of the disclosure comes in very close in timing to the beginning of the modules, which obviously puts everyone -- and when I say everyone, I include CTI and all the core participants -- it puts us all and, indeed, my Lady, yourself, under considerable pressure in terms of having to start the module, hearing evidence whilst disclosure is still ongoing, and having to respond and prepare accordingly.

This point about early and timely disclosure we say perhaps ties in quite neatly with the issues around targeted disclosure and transparency from the document providers. Also, in the absence of disclosure of Rule 9 requests, early disclosure of witness statements and relevant associated documents is particularly important and pressing.

We welcome the observations about targeted disclosure, and I also note the individuals and organisations who have been highlighted this morning who have received Rule 9 requests, and we of course look forward to assisting with this in due course.

We understand the rationale behind targeted disclosure, but in order for that to work the document providers need to be transparent and they need to respond to the Rule 9s in a timely fashion and with due expedition.

It is vital that document providers do not in any way try to use the opportunity to circumnavigate the process on disclosure by choosing what the Inquiry can see. Our families remain troubled about this.

My Lady, I know that the issue of position statements has already been ruled upon as something we put forward as a means of guarding against any sort of circumnavigation and in order for there to be full transparency. However, if there is another approach or another means by which we can all ensure that transparency, that needs to be explored in order to preserve the integrity of the process.

Three, my Lady, discrimination.

We return to this topic noting again, and welcoming, the observations made by Mr Keith King's Counsel this morning. We are cognisant and appreciative of the Inquiry's commitment to exploring issues of race and discrimination and inequalities thus far in the Inquiry in the previous modules, but we emphasise, my Lady, that it is important to understand that these are not standalone issues. Once they have been addressed in a particular module, they cannot be simply marked and checked off a list as completed. If there is a gap, it is perhaps a little bit more nuanced than to say: well, any gap identified can be filled with a previous report.

We say, my Lady, it is important that aspects and the impact of structural racism and discrimination are considered in each module, because they are relevant and important to each module, they impact in different ways according to the modules and the topics under investigation. Ultimately, the evidence that is gleaned from these feeds into the fundamental aspects of the Inquiry's lessons to be learned and guarding against repeating mistakes.

In the context of Module 4, this is particularly relevant to the question of vaccine uptake amongst minority and marginalised communities. There are known historical causes for unequal vaccine uptake. We say amongst those causes is structural racism and discrimination and socioeconomic inequalities.

The issue of "vaccine hesitancy", which effectively is a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services, is a common term used to describe this phenomenon. The term and the terminology can perhaps lead one to an inference or a suggestion that the issues lie with the individual people themselves, that they are hesitant, and it does not perhaps fully or adequately explain the historical, cultural and socioeconomic context.

As we say, there has been a historical pattern within this country where there are higher levels of resistance and fears to new vaccinations amongst certain sections of the population, particularly those from a poorer income group and those who are from ethnic minority groups, religious groups and other marginalised groups.

We note with interest that, as early as November 2022, this particular topic was addressed in a briefing from the Runnymede Trust in Manchester University entitled "Understanding the fundamental role of racism in ethnic inequities in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy". The authors are names now familiar to this Inquiry, my Lady, Professors Bécares, Dr Richard Shaw, Professor James Nazroo and Dr Patricia Irizar.

The briefing note noted that by the time people were deciding whether to have the vaccine, the conditions that created lower vaccination uptake amongst ethnic minority groups were already present. By ignoring the impact of structural and institutional racism on vaccination rates, vaccine hesitancy is misunderstood and, crucially the opportunity to address inequalities is missed.

As Professor Bécares very trenchantly opined, "vaccine hesitancy" puts the blame on individuals instead of addressing the historical and ongoing racism that has contributed to the societal inequalities that lead to ethnic inequalities in the distribution and uptake of vaccines.

Now, we hear and we welcome of course that expert reports will be provided by Professor Kasstan-Dabush and Dr Chantler, and they will consider the interplay between Covid-19 vaccine roll-outs and pre-existing inequalities and structural discrimination, and this morning we also are grateful for the information about Dr Heidi Larson.

We would raise one further point, though, that there is some force and sense, and I know that this will be perhaps developed by other CPs, in seeking an addendum report from Professor Nazroo and Professor Bécares. In any event, my Lady, we look forward to providing further submissions on these issues once the reports that have been directed are disclosed and reviewed.

Four, impact evidence.

It is a recurring theme of our families that the Inquiry needs to hear their authentic and effective voice as part of the evidence in the modules. It is a topic that greatly exercises many of them. The Inquiry of course will be looking at systemic failings, if any are there, but how does one evaluate systemic failings? Well, one looks at structures, one looks at policies, practices, how they have been implemented or not as the case may be, but one also looks at those directly impacted and affected within the system. Lived experiences should not be underestimated.

My Lady, I know that you listened with great care to those individuals who have given evidence in previous modules and the impact that that has had upon literally the hearing room and those who are present but on the whole tenor of the hearing on those particular days.

So it's not simply a question of us seeking the Inquiry to call evidence for any maudlin reasons or any mawkish reasons of sentimentality or to hear people go through terrible personal trauma. It is because we say those lived experiences actually provide the Inquiry with something concrete, evidentially, which assists in the ultimate findings and recommendations.

Within our group of families, we have identified a number of witnesses who would be able to illustrate the broad consequences and impact of the pandemic and the government response with particular regard to Module 4.

My Lady will know that, just by dint of the size of our group, it contains myriad individuals, professionals in various jobs, at various levels, management, frontline workers, those who had a personal as well as the professional understanding of the impact of the pandemic. So this is a group which, as I say and we say, would provide a wealth and a breadth and depth of evidence to the Inquiry.

We have provided in the written submissions an addendum document setting out a number of those individuals and why we say that they would be of evidential value and bring real value to the Inquiry if they are heard, and so I very much would commend that list to my Lady. And our teams, both the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK and Northern Ireland, are still in the process of obviously exploring with other members of our wider group those who wish to put themselves forward and can put forward useful and cogent and important evidence.

Finally, my Lady, on the question of parliamentary privilege, it's something we did not specifically address in our written submissions, and I briefly do so now.

We note CTI's position on this as expanded upon this morning by Mr Keith King's Counsel. We simply put it like this: adducing what is said in Parliament for the purpose of establishing when it was said and that the government knew those facts at that time, we would say, cannot be said to engage parliamentary privilege, because it does not challenge what is being said. We would respectfully agree that there is no need to rule on this.

My Lady, those are our submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much for your help, Ms Munroe, very grateful.

Right, I think probably best to break now and return at 12 o'clock.

*(11.42 am)*

*(A short break)*

*(12.00 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Can I just say that I notice some members of the public gallery are using crutches. When the usher's cry goes up "All rise", I wouldn't consider it any discourtesy if somebody who had difficulty standing didn't stand.

Right, I think the next speaker is Mr Puar.
