Transcript of Module 4 Preliminary Hearing on 22 May 2024

*(10.29 am)*

1. Introductory Remarks by the Chair
====================================

**Lady Hallett**: Good morning. This is the second preliminary hearing for Module 4, vaccines and therapeutics.

As ever, we have a great deal to get through today, so I must, I'm afraid, insist that core participants stick to the tight timetable and the timings they have been given. I don't want to intervene, and I know that some of our core participants have not been represented before, so -- I know the others all know how tight I can be on timetables -- so please, everybody, don't make me intervene, it would be bad for everybody.

Mr Keith will now outline the major issues that I shall have to be considering for this second preliminary hearing.
