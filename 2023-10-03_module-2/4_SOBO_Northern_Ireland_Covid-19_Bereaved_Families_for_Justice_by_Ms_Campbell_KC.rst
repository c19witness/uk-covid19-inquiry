4. Submissions on Behalf of Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Ms Campbell KC
=====================================================================================================

**Ms Campbell**: Thank you, my Lady.

My Lady, on behalf of the Northern Irish Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, together with Peter Wilcock King's Counsel, our junior counsel including Mr McGowan, who's here today, and our instructing solicitors, PA Duffy & Co, we welcome both the opening address from Mr Keith King's Counsel and also this opportunity to address you further today on behalf of the devolved administrations and Northern Ireland in particular.

This module of course focuses on central government and later modules, we know, are to examine in greater detail the response of the devolved administrations, or DAs as I might call them.

In the case of Northern Ireland, that examination will come in Module 2C in April into May next year, but it's important that I emphasise at this stage that this module is of critical importance to the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved, because this is a starting point for examining and assessing the pandemic response in Northern Ireland, and there are a number of reasons for that.

The most obvious is that Westminster was taking decisions which were not or at least ought not to have been just for England but were of UK-wide significance.

At the early stages of the pandemic and at many stages throughout, all eyes, including those of the devolved representatives, were on Westminster. Initially eyes were strained waiting and willing the UK Government to act, and to act with purpose, the purpose being, we hoped, to protect lives. And thereafter, eyes were open in horror and distrust as stories of disarray at the heart of government and parties at the height of the pandemic gripped the headlines, rubbing salt into the wounds of the bereaved.

The action and inaction in Westminster had consequences far beyond its postcode.

Of course in this module at its core we examine the communication between the UK Government and the devolved administrations. Communication that we observe could have been conducted via well-established mechanisms, could and should have been based on consultation and transparent decision-making, could and should have recognised the need to make decisions based on the particular needs of the devolved nations, could and should have respected the insight to be gained from our local representatives, and should have been driven by a desire to protect our populations rather than to protect any perceived political hierarchy.

My Lady, from the material received and considered to date, the Northern Irish Covid Bereaved fear that at almost every level there were failings in that communication.

In order to properly assess where the failings may lie and the consequences of such failings, it will be important to closely scrutinise all sides of the story. Were the apparent fears of the Westminster government justified that the devolved administrations would diverge from Whitehall for "the sake of being different", as the former Prime Minister suggests, or does that suggest a belittling of the decision-making of our elected representatives?

Is there evidence before this Inquiry from all quarters, from the DAs, and from regional mayors, that there are systemic problems with the governance emerging from Westminster in that it failed to recognise or even adequately attempt to recognise the need for a localised approach to this global pandemic?

You're aware, my Lady, of our previously voiced concerns at the decision you took not to hear from devolved witnesses in this module, and those concerns persist. But in order to go some way to assuage them as this module progresses, we do ask that you keep under close scrutiny the approach of Westminster to how the pandemic gripped the devolved administrations in areas that include scientific analysis, political response, international relations, and financial constraints, because the decisions or indecisions by Westminster were of wider impact. They directly affected our lives in Northern Ireland.

By way of just two examples, both that we've heard of today, the Cheltenham Festival and the Liverpool football match attract significant support from across the island of Ireland. The Cheltenham Festival invited many thousands of Northern Ireland to travel, to mingle, and to spread the virus across three full days in mid-March 2020, and in the same week football fans flocked to watch Liverpool play Atletico Madrid, flying and sailing to the northwest of England, many returning home with the virus.

Our clients strongly believe that these decisions allowed the disease to flourish on the island of Ireland, and considered that it was obvious at the time that this would happen. Their belief appears to be supported by the evidence that you will receive in this module. Your expert witness, Professor Thomas Hale, identifies numerous studies that support that conclusion. He observes that the rapid banning of public events played a crucial role in explaining decreases in death rates across European countries during the first wave the pandemic. According to studies, a single day of delay in implementing a mass gathering ban or a school closure meant, respectively, a 6.97% and a 4.37% decrease in cumulative deaths. Every day mattered.

There is no doubt that people in Northern Ireland, including those in authority, looked to and relied on the UK to inform our own response. While many of those whom we represent would criticise our own Northern Irish responses, little more than the UK response with a two-week delay, it is important in the context of this module to consider the extent to which Northern Ireland was hindered in its ability to reach informed decisions either despite or because of the reliance on the United Kingdom response.

My Lady, I'll touch briefly on science, because one aspect of concern was access to information and scientific advice.

Baroness Foster, from whom you heard in Module 1, will emphasise the importance to Northern Ireland of access to the wider pool of experts, including SAGE, greater access than would have ordinarily been available in Northern Ireland. And given this reliance, the make-up of SAGE, therefore, is a matter of importance to us. Despite this being a public health emergency, in fact the public health emergency of our time, and despite the large pool of experts available in the United Kingdom, evidence suggests that there was not a single public health expert or coronavirus expert on SAGE in the early stages of the pandemic.

Did that failure to ensure that appropriate experts were contributing from the outset result in early but significant errors in approach?

Our concerns don't stop there. The devolved authorities may have been denied the opportunity to identify critical omissions given the lack of a devolved representation on SAGE, as you heard in Module 1. This absence was in fact most glaring in Northern Ireland. The earliest date of any Northern Ireland representative at a SAGE meeting was on 9 April. That was the 24th SAGE meeting, coming weeks after a nationwide lockdown had been imposed. Did this inequality of access inhibit the devolved nations' ability to implement an informed response? It's difficult to see, we submit, how it could be said to be otherwise.

The Inquiry will also see and hear evidence that more than half of the SAGE sub-groups had no representation at all from a devolved administration. According to Professor Henderson, from whom you will hear, a predominantly English frame of reference undoubtedly meant that advice to local populations at times did not meet local circumstances. So, in following the science, was the science just for England? And if that is correct, given the influence of SAGE recommendations on the political response, to what extent did that response make decisions in the best interests of the devolved regions and Northern Ireland in particular?

You know, my Lady, only too well that the Northern Ireland Executive did not function before 10 January 2020, and by that stage we know that there were already important developments in what was known about this new coronavirus and assessing what the potential risk was.

Key questions for the Inquiry in this period are: who was watching out for Northern Ireland in the absence of an Assembly? Was the situation in Northern Ireland, a part of UK without a functioning government, considered at all? It doesn't appear to have been. And what was told to relevant officials in Northern Ireland at that very early stage? Questions that of course are all the more important now, given that our Assembly is once again in a state of collapse.

The Inquiry will hear evidence that, following the reinstatement of the Assembly in January 2020, the Northern Irish First Minister and deputy First Minister were not invited to attend a COBR meeting until 2 March 2020. Could this Assembly, in its infancy, properly begin to respond to the pandemic that was taking hold if it didn't have full access to the science about what was to come and to the political decision-making in response to it?

Sir Jeremy Farrar, formerly of SAGE, writes that knowledge must be shared within hours and days and not weeks, and knowledge must lead to action. The world had all the information it needed by 24 January 2020: a potentially fatal novel respiratory disease that could spread between people without symptoms, with no vaccines or treatment, that had already ravaged a huge highly connected Chinese city. Early scientific papers were spelling out its grim clinical consequences in patients.

The world may have had all the information it needed, but did the UK Government consider it and share it appropriately with the devolved nations? And of course how did they, when they began to communicate, do so?

The evidence that you will hear suggests that mechanisms which should have been well placed to allow for a co-ordinated response and communication across these islands and amongst the devolved administrations had fallen into disuse and were not resurrected.

You will know of the observation of Professor Henderson that "pre-existing organisations to facilitate intergovernmental working were notably not pressed into service during the coronavirus pandemic", and she references the use of the JMC and the British-Irish Council.

In April 2020 the former Prime Minister agreed to a proposal to "manage the devolved administrations". That language is repeated and, we submit, it's telling.

But his proposal to "manage the devolved administrations" was through the usual Joint Ministerial Committee mechanisms. But despite the JMC having a joint secretariat and being staffed by officials from the Cabinet Office and from devolved administrations, it didn't materialise, and there were no meetings of the JMC in the relevant period.

Instead, as with other responses of central government to the pandemic, the approach to devolved administrations was to use ad hoc meetings without any meaningful defined role for devolved actors.

My Lady, the Inquiry may find it illuminating that the very same advice to Boris Johnson which suggested his daily 9.15s, his 9.15 meeting, to "allow for decisions to be taken at that meeting", also expressly advised that the devolved administrations should not be invited. Rather, they were going to be updated on the response via a separate process established with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

Notably absent from this advice was the suggestion of any advance consultation or co-operation between Westminster and the devolved administrations. The logic underpinning it was that decisions would be taken without them in the room and meetings with devolved administrations became opportunities to convey those decisions and the details of decisions already taken.

It's important to recognise that these decisions to exclude devolved actors from decision-making were deliberate. They were not as a result of urgency, or as a consequence of oversight. The approach appears to reflect the views of those in government at the time, such as those expressed by the then Secretary of State for Health, Mr Hancock, who recalls thinking that it was "madness that the devolved government will be taking their own lead on domestic health policy".

This view, we suggest, led to flawed decision-making. It undermined co-operation across the islands. It reinforced the appearance of the response as England-centric. It failed to treat the people of Northern Ireland with the respect or afford them the protection to which they were entitled, and in due course we anticipate we will invite you to make such recommendations as to ensure that that does not happen again.

My Lady, a brief word on the Treasury. Significantly, the devolved response can't properly be analysed and assessed without considering that Westminster was at all stages controlling the purse strings. It was not reasonably possible to implement effective public health measures without financial support, and we know that. As Professor Hale notes, and is common sense, economic support bolsters compliance. But did the Treasury provide economic support where and when individual jurisdictions needed it? Was there financial scope for Northern Ireland to diverge where necessary from the approach being taken in England? Or was it simply a matter of how soon the same measures were imposed and lifted in England dictated how soon they would apply in Ireland?

The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, describes the Treasury refusing his request for funds to allow Wales to implement a circuit breaker until such time as it was necessary to take those actions in England.

What of our nearest neighbour, the south or Republic of Ireland? Northern Ireland sits on a different island and epidemiological unit to Great Britain. What approach did Westminster take to address the unique geographical and epidemiological circumstances of Northern Ireland? Was there any consideration or adequate consideration of communication with the Irish Government in the best interests of the citizens of the north?

My Lady, one insight into the interface between the UK government response and the need to co-ordinate with the devolved administrations comes from the outcome of a meeting of 14 March 2020. You heard about it briefly this morning. It was between the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Secretary of State for Health, the CMO and the CSA. It was, by this stage, mid-March. As Mr Gove will put it, there was pressure on the Prime Minister to "shift gears and accelerate plans" at this time. No official from the devolved administrations was present or represented at this meeting, but the outcome bears some attention.

It says this:

"We require a cross-governmental package on shielding the vulnerable and elderly by Wednesday lunchtime ..."

I add, that being 18 March 2020.

"... for review by the Prime Minister the following morning [ie 19 March 2020], to be in sufficient depth to be ready for implementation. The advice should include 'how to handle the devolved administrations'."

We were then in mid-March, and the government was calling for a package to shield the elderly and vulnerable against a background in which, on 21 January 2020, Professor Woolhouse and his colleagues, Professor Ferguson and Farrar, loudly sounded the alarm that they expected a pandemic fuelled by mild cases but with significant mortality in the vulnerable groups.

Seven weeks on, seven weeks of the Prime Minister expressing concern not to scare the financial markets, belittling the risks of contracting Covid, dithering and delay, he calls, for what appears to be the first time, for a package to protect the elderly and the vulnerable, and to "handle the devolved administrations".

That package was too late for many. It was too late to provide any protection for Ruth Burke, the indomitable mother of Brenda Doherty from whom you heard powerful evidence at the end of Module 1. You will recall that Mrs Burke was amongst the first to die from Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, passing away on 24 March 2020.

That package provided no protection for Mary Magdalene Mitchell, nor any consolation to her five daughters who grieve her loss. Mrs Mitchell fell ill on 18 March 2020, the very day that cross-governmental package was to be ready for consideration. She had until then lived in her care home in Belfast, to which access was unrestricted.

On 19 March 2020 while the then Prime Minister was, we dare to hope, considering how he might protect the elderly and vulnerable, she tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to hospital.

When it quickly became clear that she was not going to recover, her five daughters had to choose which one of them would attend hospital to say their brief final farewell, and she passed away alone on 25 March 2020, her family then having to suffer the indignity and the trauma of being unable to fulfil their mother's funeral wishes.

Of course, from then we know the situation escalated. Professor Medley warned starkly, just on month later, in April 2020, that his reading of the situation is that:

"We have widespread ongoing transmission in the health and social care systems. Hospital and community health and social care appear to be driving transmission and potentially at an increasing rate. In effect, this is the opposite of shielding, the vulnerable are being preferentially infected."

Those chilling words resonate with so many of the bereaved in Northern Ireland, and if I may conclude with reference to some of them, including some who are here today.

They include the family of Ann McIvor who lost their very much loved mother. Mrs McIvor had been supported and protected by her family in her own home in the early stages of the pandemic, but when she required hospital treatment they entrusted her to the health and social care system. After weeks of moves and mixed messages and chaos in a system that was ill equipped and ill prepared to cope, Mrs McIvor contracted the virus and passed away alone on 20 May 2020. On that same date up to 200 people had been invited to a "bring your own booze" party in Downing Street, an event that was attended by the then Prime Minister.

Almost one year later, Nuala Scullion died on 24 April 2021. Her family are here today. She was taken in an ambulance to the hospital and never saw her family again. She was admitted to the ICU, placed on a ventilator for weeks, and the hospital imposed a DNR without contacting her family, and in circumstances where Mrs Scullion was not in a position to give informed consent. The indignity of her death and the denial of her funeral rights continue to cause her family anguish.

The family of Raymond McAleese, who was 52 years of age when he died. He was a much loved uncle and brother. He was also a man with Down's Syndrome. In September 2021, 18 months into the pandemic, and at a time when, as we have heard this afternoon from Mr Keith, Westminster once again flip-flopped or prevaricated on how to respond to the resurgence of the pandemic, Raymond contracted Covid in his care home and died within a matter of days. The confusion and fear he will have felt and faced, largely alone, in the days between his diagnosis and death continues to torment his family.

Later that year, on 23 December 2021, much loved husband, father and grandfather Peter Clarke passed away. Peter's wife and his daughter are here today. He was a retired fireman and a diagnosis of bronchitis had been a legacy of his service to the fire service. Even at that advanced stage of the pandemic, his family harboured grave concerns about the preparedness of the response. He was admitted to a Covid ward without a Covid test, placed on a ventilator without the consent of his family, a DNR was noted on his records without proper consultation, and concerns persist about the medication and the move on to end of life care.

Of course there are many thousands more, including the father of Catriona Myles, from whom you will hear on Thursday of this week as part of the impact evidence.

My Lady, there's an important overriding point to make on behalf of those whom we represent. It's well known that Northern Ireland is a society that is divided politically, but the bereaved whom we represent are drawn from all sides of that community, sharing loss, grief, anger and trauma. That they do so reflects a basic scientific reality: a pandemic is not only or even properly a political challenge; it's a public health challenge. And as Sir Graham Medley observed, pandemics do not respect national or subnational boundaries, a global failure was not to have international co-operation and concerted strategies and to agree a common approach.

Those whom we represent consider that this global failure was replicated domestically by the Westminster government. Their response lacked the necessary consultation to ensure effective co-operation and lacked strategies to agree a concerted approach with the aim of protecting lives.

We anticipate that the evidence in this module will show that the people of Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole were failed as a result of that.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Campbell.

Right, Ms Mitchell.
