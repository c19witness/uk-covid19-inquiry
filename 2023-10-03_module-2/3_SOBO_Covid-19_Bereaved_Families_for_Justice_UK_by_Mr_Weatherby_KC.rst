3. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK by Mr Weatherby KC
========================================================================================

**Mr Weatherby**: Good afternoon, my Lady, and thank you for that.

Can I start by welcoming the opening comments by Mr Keith, which were comprehensive, and we will assist to the best that we can to assist in answering the questions that he's posed. I take your encouragement to stick to the time limit, and I will endeavour to do so. I might just go slightly over, but I hope you'll stay with me. In January 2020 Lord Bethell was the government health whip in the House of Lords, and in March 2020 he became a minister in the Department of Health and Social Care. This is what he said in a recent interview with the Institute for Government, which was widely reported: "By mid-January, we in the top floor of the DHSC had a pretty clear idea of what the train was looking like coming down the tracks." He then said this: "No 10 didn't want to prioritise the pandemic in early 2020, even though the evidence was mounting -- there was a post-election, ostrich head-in-the-sand mentality ... its priority, and what we were told many times, was Brexit and levelling-up. 'We have to deliver Brexit, so could your pandemic quietly go and mind your own business, please', we were told. After that, we got a lot of erratic dipping-in -- in Yiddish, it's called 'kibbitzing', erratic and ill-informed interference."

What you made of the Module 1 evidence remains of course to be seen, but in our submission it showed a shocking lack of preparedness, little resilience with a chronically underfunded health sector, and the absence of a functioning social care system, compounded by a lack of any proper pandemic planning.

We pose the following questions: how many lives would have been saved if there had been a whole-system pandemic plan, proper resilience within the health and social care systems, a minister responsible for civil emergencies, a standing scientific committee on pandemics, a proper collaborative framework for working with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland devolved administrations, and also with local authorities? Many lives would have been saved, is the answer that we would provide.

So, most relevant to present purposes, the Module 1 evidence has highlighted that the United Kingdom had a standing start, in our submission, from January 2020, and it's the role of any competent government or administration to react swiftly to whatever crises arise, with the resources that are available to catch up, and to protect the population so far as is possible.

What was needed, then, was a dynamic and proactive government response to lead and galvanise the country. But instead we got what Lord Bethell has starkly stated, in what amounts to a pretty devastating series of admissions from within the centre of government: ostrich syndrome, fixation on Brexit to the exclusion of anything else, and erratic ill-informed interference from Number 10.

His words, not mine.

It amounts to dither, delay, indecision, denial, bluster and, above all, a lack of leadership.

And the views of Lord Bethell will come as no surprise, given the views of others as set out by Mr Keith this morning and which I don't need to repeat.

Mr Johnson himself appears set to paint a rose-tinted account to this Inquiry, and recently he asserted that the United Kingdom "defied most of the gloomier predictions and has ended the pandemic ... well down the league tables for excess mortality".

Is that really so? Well, according to an analysis by the John Moores University of Medicine cited in our written submissions, per head of population the United Kingdom was the number 20 worst of 173 countries in terms of the number of deaths.

Was the outcome really as good as Mr Johnson pretends? It will not surprise you that the 7,000 bereaved family members we represent will beg to differ.

The bereaved families want vital questions answered. They want candour from public representatives and public servants, not self-serving justifications, bluster and downright fiction. They present 230,000 reasons why Mr Johnson's "we didn't do too badly" opening gambit should be rejected. I'll return to the bereaved families in a little while, because of their real life experience, some of which you heard this morning.

If it's correct that the UK Government started with no plan and no real health or social care resilience, how quickly did the government mitigate those deficits? Well, it appears that the starting point was that Mr Johnson failed to take the emerging threat seriously. Initially he will tell us that he thought it was just a scare, and in his statement he says that the impact of the Creutzfeld Jakob disease was initially overstated. He refers to a "bird flu scare" when he was Mayor of London, and he remarks that the 30 January WHO declaration of Covid as a public health emergency of international concern was just one of a number since 2009.

His government approached the emerging crisis as a health issue to be dealt with by the DHSC rather than the real whole-system threat that it actually posed.

I've already mentioned Lord Bethell's views by mid-January that it was clear to him and others at the DHSC what was coming down the track. But Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam will tell us that as early as 16 January he was "certain that the UK would be struck by a severe pandemic".

Mr Hancock will tell us that by 22 January he was warning Mr Johnson directly in a phone call that there was a 50% chance that the virus would escape China and, in his words, "go global", and that a "very large number of people would likely die".

Mr Johnson says he doesn't recall this conversation, a somewhat surprising assertion, given its content. Mr Hancock will also tell us that Number 10 refused his request for COBR, the central government emergency committee, to be stood up until 24 January, calling him "alarmist".

Although this evidence would suggest at least Mr Hancock was taking the crisis seriously at this time, other evidence indicates complacency on his part too. In a WhatsApp exchange on 25 January, Dominic Cummings asked him about the extent of preparedness for a pandemic. Mr Hancock replied, "We have full plans up to and including pandemic level regularly prepped and refreshed". It will be interesting to see how he squares that assertion with his Module 1 assessment that the UK level of preparedness was "woefully inadequate".

Of course, Mr Cummings was the PM's Chief of Staff at this time. For reasons which are unclear to us, his statement and documents have yet to be disclosed, as indeed has the content of Mr Johnson's phone from this period, so I'm unable to take this part of the story too much further, as to what was behind this request of Mr Hancock.

Whilst I am on the subject, Mr Johnson claims that although he's downloaded the phone, the WhatsApp messaging from the crucial period of 31 January to 7 June 2020 are unrecoverable, a remarkable and unfortunate coincidence, we would say.

In line with your forthright warnings earlier in the process around the integrity of evidence, we would urge the Inquiry to commission experts to see why those messages can't be retrieved, and whether they may have been deleted.

In considering whether, as Mr Keith says, Mr Cummings was part of the problem and Mr Hancock was less than competent, as some would have it, you'll no doubt take account of the fact that they were in positions at the appointment of Mr Johnson himself.

Mr Keith has set out the chronology in some detail. The Inquiry will have to consider whether vital time to form a contingency plan and to act was squandered. Urgent continencies were certainly needed: to do what was possible to mitigate the lack of resources and resilience in hospitals and care homes, increase bed capacity, find ways of increasing staffing availability, provision of isolation and quarantine units, extra intensive care provision, ventilators, PPE, guidance and planning for infection control. Vital time was lost which should have been used to ramp up the manufacture of tests, which had been devised, we're told, by mid-January. Facilities to roll them out, laboratory capacity, PPE procurement and distribution, facilities to vigorously pursue test and trace, similar to contact tracing successfully operated in other countries.

None of this would be done, because part of the government was in denial and others had a false view of its own preparedness.

None of these failings, in our submission, can be explained by scientific advice.

We'll be told, of course, as Mr Keith has indicated, that some will say that they were following the science. Is that really the case?

Mr Keith has helpfully referred to an email from Professor Woolhouse on 25 January warning about the urgent threat of the pandemic, the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed. That email copied to all four UK Chief Medical Officers. It was one of a series of emails in fact sent between 21 and 31 January by Professor Woolhouse, and it's important to note that this key one referred to by Mr Keith begins with an apology for when it was sent, on a Saturday.

That, we would say, is a clear measure of its urgency. And he was at pains to set out that the tripling of the excess death rate and overwhelming of the NHS was not a worst-case scenario and that he'd conferred with other leading lights in the scientific world, Jeremy Farrar and Professor Ferguson in particular.

If the government was following the science, what happened as a result of that dire warning from such eminent experts? And we would say we can identify precious little over the following two months that followed from those warnings. And in fact, of course, those warnings, Mr Keith has said, are not isolated. By 29 January COBR was being briefed that the UK faced a possible reasonable worst-case scenario similar to pandemic flu. The importance of that is, of course, that the reasonable worst-case scenario was 800,000 deaths.

We've heard Mr Johnson wasn't at COBR to hear this, and he wasn't at COBR for more than another month after, until March. He'll tell us that he properly left things to others, but the reality is there was a leadership void.

As we set out in the written opening, as Mr Keith has graphically outlined this morning, during this period there was a daily trail of warnings and evidence of the pandemic going global.

In April, The Sunday Times ran an article headlined "38 days when Britain sleepwalked into disaster". The thrust of the article was that the UK sleepwalked into widespread community infection, with little action to slow it or prepare for the worst that was to come.

It struck a chord at the DHSC, which, unusually, put out a detailed rebuttal, asserting in the strongest of language that "the article contains a series of falsehoods and errors and actively misrepresents".

Now, I'm not here to defend The Sunday Times. I'll leave that to the government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance. His contemporary notes say:

"The [Sunday Times] got it about right. We warned of pandemic flu level deaths in January. [Matt Hancock] kept too much in DHSC and didn't move fast enough. [The Civil Contingencies Secretariat] was slow as well."

He continued that The Sunday Times had "basically ... got it right". So, again, was the government following the science?

In a different entry, in April, Professor Vallance quotes Matt Hancock admonishing him:

"Science advice we can't do because of supplies, is worse than useless."

The clear inference is that certain ministers were not so much following the science as wanting cover from scientific advisers for shortcomings in provisions. Here it was masks.

The theme continued with the change of designation of Covid as being a high-consequence infectious disease; as we know it was designated as such on 16 January, given that it had the potential to spread widely and with large scale fatal consequences.

But on 19 March as the UK slid into the first devastating wave, the UK downgraded the designation of the virus, no longer categorising it as an HCID. As we understand it, without advice or consulting SAGE.

The effect of downgrading was to reduce the standards of PPE required by healthcare guidance. Or moving the goalposts to avoid criticism might be a way that we would put it.

We'll hear from Mr Johnson that scientific advice is also responsible for poor decisions. He will suggest that there was no evidence of asymptomatic transmission, and that explains why the risks were underestimated in the early months.

We'll hear from Mr Hancock that there was a global scientific consensus until April 2020 that the virus did not transmit asymptomatically. That is completely untrue. The High Court unpicked this issue in its judgment in the Gardner case. The 29 January COBR meeting already referred to was briefed that there were early indications of asymptomatic transmission. The Professor Woolhouse emails referred to earlier noted that by 31 January there was growing evidence of asymptomatic transmission. By mid-March Patrick Vallance was publicly saying on the Today programme that asymptomatic transmission was a probability.

It's important to note that this very public acknowledgement by Professor Vallance came just four days before the decision on 17 March 2020 to discharge 30,000 patients from hospitals without testing, many to care homes. I'll return to that a little later.

Mr Keith has already referred to the fact it was two months into the emergency before Mr Johnson attended his first COBR meeting, 2 March. The day before he engaged in what can only be described as cavalier and incredibly unhelpful public messaging when he visited the Royal Free Hospital, telling the media, "I think there were a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you will be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands".

We now know he received a briefing the night before his hospital visit expressly referring to transmission by touching an infected person. It's difficult to see his actions and media comments as other than dismissive of a disaster which had been looming for two months and was now just around the corner.

By 2 March the pandemic had not only struck China, the Far East, South East Asia and Italy, but there was sustained community transmission in Germany and France. The contact tracing in the UK had failed.

Mr Keith has gone through what did and didn't happen in March, and we've set it out in our written opening, but in overview, until 23 March the approach was largely messaging, advice rather than action. Pubs, clubs and restaurants remained open until 20 March. A particular issue, as we've heard, was mass assemblies.

By early March, Madrid had become a hot spot, yet thousands of fans would travel to the Champions League match in Liverpool on 11 March because the UK government not only did not have travel restrictions but did not curb mass assemblies and encouraged the match to go ahead. Other major events went ahead around the same time as we've heard: rugby internationals, incidentally attended by Mr Johnson himself; the Cheltenham Festival between 10 and 13 March, with international travellers. Only on 16 March was there even advice against gatherings.

Joan Lally picked up two close relatives from the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid match. They all contracted Covid, and Joan died. Her husband John believes her death would have been prevented had the government acted to stop mass sporting events at a time when it should have been obvious to them that they would become superspreading events, resulting in mass infection and death.

John comments that his wife's death was not only his loss, because for decades she had run a girl guides group in a disadvantaged area which had to close as a result of her untimely death.

Likewise, Richard Mawson developed symptoms a few days after attending the same match. He died on 17 April, his son Jamie believes, again, the result of the failure to stop mass sporting events.

Inaction had consequences.

No doubt the government did receive differing advice, some against taking certain measures. It seized upon that to explain its indecision, its dithering and its delay. The families I represent count that decision, that incompetence, in the numbers of their loved ones who died, and their stories show how these failures really impacted.

Jo Goodman's dad Stuart died on 2 April. You will hear from her tomorrow as the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK group witness. She believes that Stuart contracted Covid in a crowded hospital waiting room at an outpatient appointment on 18 March a week before lockdown. He was vulnerable as he was due to begin cancer treatment and had taken his own sensible precautions. But without lockdown, without apparent infection control in public spaces, without general mask wearing, restrictions on transport and mass assemblies, he was left extremely vulnerable when he had to travel and attend the hospital appointment.

The early decisions, the lack of action, are therefore of acute concern to Jo. Indeed, Jo was in India in early March, and she was present there when many of the events of the important religious festival of Holi on 10 March were cancelled. She comments, in contrast at that time the UK was allowing large sporting events to continue and, worse, thereby promoting mass international travel from hotspots such as Madrid.

Alison Saunders' partner James Yates died on 8 April. He had an impaired immune system and Alison believes he contracted Covid at a factory in Livingston, in Scotland, where he worked, or possibly as a result of a trip to Glasgow prior to lockdown, where he visited a number of pubs which had been allowed to stay open.

Alison believes that the lateness of the lockdown, the failure to take other important decisions early enough, the lack of safeguards provided to vulnerable people such as James, increased the probability of him and others succumbing. She comments that many such deaths were preventable had there been earlier action by the UK and the Scottish governments. In this regard she particularly notes the apparent differences between the Scottish and UK governments about restrictions on mass assemblies at the time which she believes added to the delay.

In this regard the families are concerned that the Inquiry fully considers how the UK Government and devolved administrations co-operated and collaborated or the extent to which they did or didn't.

Mr Johnson would have it that his government involved the devolved administrations, including in COBR and through the CMOs. We don't doubt there was co-operation at some levels. What we urge the Inquiry to look at, however, is whether the UK Government was really interested in the compliance of the devolved administrations, persuading them to go along with UK policy such as it was, or whether they actually valued the devolved relationships and differing opinions, in particular in meeting different challenges.

Mr Johnson has commented that he put Mr Gove in charge of the relationship with the devolved administrations because he didn't want there to be a "mini EU" of four nations. That will be an issue which will need some explaining and unpicking.

Ranjith Chandrapala was a London bus driver on the No 92 route, which started at Ealing Hospital, where subsequently he sadly died. His family believe he contracted Covid at work around 20 April. A number of his colleagues had Covid at the time. There was no testing for drivers. He had not been provided with PPE. There were no Covid safeguards on the buses and those being carried were not required to wear masks.

The family comment that Ranjith was a frontline worker left without proper protection, and his death illustrates not only the likely effects of delay and lack of early measures, but also the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on transport workers generally, and black and brown emergency and key workers in particular, given that a third of Transport for London employees are from minority ethnic communities.

Disproportionate effect was a factor particularly evidenced in sectors with high percentages of black and brown workers, including health and social care, transport and the gig economy. The Inquiry has instructed experts on structural discrimination issues and it will be vital that it looks at how such issues were considered -- if at all -- from the outset, and throughout the pandemic.

Structural racial discrimination, other forms of structural discrimination, in particular regarding disability and age, and with respect to gender and sexual orientation, had a real impact. It's not suggested that an emergency response to any civil disaster can solve such issues, but it is emphasised that the reality of structural discrimination should have been a consideration of central importance to policymakers in mitigating that disproportionate impact. It's simply not correct that the pandemic affected us all equally. So far as we can see, as with the preparedness evidence in Module 1, structural discrimination was an elephant in the emergency response room. There's scant evidence that it was considered at all.

It's important to acknowledge that disproportionate impacts persisted throughout the pandemic. Winston Jones, for example, was a 53-year old transport worker. He died on 6 January 2021. His wife Wendy and his three children believe that he and his fellow workers were impacted by mixed messaging after the first lockdown -- which I'll turn to in a moment -- poor guidance, and a lack of supervision of those measures that were in place by the time of his death.

When the government ended the first lockdown, it appears that its decision-making got no less erratic. Mr Keith has mentioned the Eat Out to Help Out policy, which involved subsidising people who were coming out of a lockdown designed to minimise social gatherings to gather with others in enclosed spaces. Explained as an economic recovery measure, it appears that it was rolled out without any scientific advice. We anticipate that scientists will say their advice would have been strongly against such a hare-brained scheme.

The Inquiry will have to consider whether the government really was following the science, or whether Mr Sunak's flagship policy hastened the next wave of infections.

Furthermore, did Mr Johnson, as in March, unduly delay the second lockdown leading to greater loss of life and longer economic and social disruption? What is clear, in our submission, is that lessons were not being learned as the government went along.

Christina Fulop died of Covid on 8 January 2021. She lived at home and was assisted by domiciliary care workers. Her daughter Naomi, herself a professor of health care organisation and management, notes that the care workers were provided with no masks during March and April 2020. At the beginning of May 2020 her mother was sent 21 masks for one week to give each carer when they visited her. She had three per day. At the end of that week, Christina received a letter from the care agency saying that the policy as set out by Public Health England had changed and that carers would have one mask per eight-hour shift.

Although Christina survived the first wave, she contracted Covid during the winter and died during the subsequent lockdown. Naomi believes that insufficient PPE for care workers, the late imposition of the second lockdown, and the ineffectiveness of NHS Test and Trace led to her mother's death. She further notes that she had been unable to see her mother for some weeks because of the lockdown, was unable to visit her in hospital when she was dying, and could only have a very restricted funeral. This hugely distressing experience was greatly exacerbated as it coincided with some of the illegal drinks parties at Number 10.

The families have real concerns that the ongoing failures of policy and erratic response firstly led to mass discharges of mainly older patients from hospitals to care facilities without testing, causing greater transmission into the most vulnerable settings, and then led to the under-admission of older people who needed hospital treatment and the triaging of patients resulting in the restriction of critical care for older and vulnerable people and the inappropriate use of DNACPRs. The families raise issues about dignity too, the treatment of the deceased and of the bereaved in terms of cultural norms and funerals, as you saw powerfully in the impact films this morning.

Finally, the families raise the obvious points that Mr Keith mentioned about public figures, Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak, Mr Cummings and Mr Hancock amongst them, breaking their own regulations, reports of suitcases of drink being taken into Downing Street during lockdown, illegal partying. These are already established facts, they're not for the Inquiry to determine, but the families urge the Inquiry not to ignore the undermining of public messaging that these crass and disgraceful events caused. Whilst the vast majority of the country buckled down, complied, and came together, some did not.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Weatherby. And thank you too for the written submissions that you sent. I found them all extremely helpful. Thank you.

**Mr Weatherby**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: I think the suggestion is that we should carry on. I'm not getting a nod from our lovely stenographer. I think we'll take a break now.

We'll have a ten-minute break now and then, if necessary, have another break later.

So Ms Campbell KC, after the break, please.

*(3.05 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(3.15 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, Ms Campbell.
