7. Submissions on Behalf of Long Covid Kids, Long Covid SOS and Long Covid Support by Mr Metzer KC
==================================================================================================

**Mr Metzer**: Thank you.

Forgotten, unheard, disbelieved, isolated, unemployed, disabled, immobile. These are the words that characterise the life-altering and devastating experience that people with long Covid have continued to suffer in the pandemic.

My Lady, I appear with Sangeetha Iengar and Shanthi Sivarkumaran on behalf of the long Covid groups, instructed by Jane Ryan of Bhatt Murphy.

The long Covid groups are Long Covid Kids, Long Covid SOS, and Long Covid Support, grassroots patient advocacy organisations whose members were compelled to come together in the early months of the pandemic to give voice to and raise awareness of long Covid, the long-term illness caused by Covid-19.

At the outset, the long Covid groups wish to acknowledge the pain suffered by the bereaved families who lost loved ones to Covid-19 and offer their condolences to them.

As Hugo Keith King's Counsel has previously noted, long Covid is an injury, a serious condition, even a serious morbidity, which is the result of having had Covid. People with long Covid are the surviving ongoing victims of the pandemic. We have seen on the impact film people with long Covid explaining movingly that they did not know if there will ever be light at the end of the tunnel. My Lady, the long Covid groups ask your Inquiry to shed light on whether their suffering was avoidable. They seek truth and accountability for the harms they have suffered and, crucially, reassurance that the suffering of 2 million people in the UK is not an inevitable fate bound to be repeated in future pandemics.

The Inquiry will hear from multiple sources that the possibility of long-term post-viral illness was well known before this pandemic. Sir Patrick Vallance states:

"From my perspective, I was conscious that long-term sequelae were a possible outcome of Covid-19 from early on in the pandemic."

Professor Brightling and Dr Evans echo this view and point to lessons from previous corona pandemics, SARS and MERS, that should have been learned. Their expert opinion is that it was foreseeable that there was going to be long-term sequelae from Covid-19, extrapolated from previous coronavirus pandemics and previous knowledge of post viral syndromes.

My Lady, a running thread of concern for this Inquiry will be: long Covid was foreseeable, so why was it not foreseen?

The Inquiry will hear of a dissonance in Westminster between knowledge of long Covid, on the one hand, and political recognition of it, on the other, and an even greater dissonance between knowledge of long Covid and any reaction to its risks.

The first of six framework questions which the long Covid groups hope the Inquiry will investigate is: what did decision-makers know and understand of long-term sequelae and long Covid? To answer that, the Inquiry will hear evidence from scientific advisers. Members of NERVTAG on 6 March 2020, before the first lockdown, had already advised that identifying the end of symptoms may be very prolonged or very difficult to define.

On 28 April 2020, SAGE 29 went further, advising on the importance of cohort studies of Covid-19 survivors to understanding the longer term effects.

By 15 May 2020, NERVTAG discussed the need for ongoing clinical issues post-Covid and the potential need for a clinical forum. There was also early understanding that long-term sequelae could pose a risk to children. NERVTAG noted this risk in February 2020 and by April 2020 SAGE 29 agreed to action priority studies on Kawasaki-like syndrome in children.

The Department of Health and Social Care was equally alert to the long-term health impact of Covid-19, and in June 2020 recorded sequelae of the disease, potential long-term lung and organ disease, as one of four major implications for the health and care system that would have to be catered for.

By 17 July 2020, Matt Hancock chaired a roundtable mandated to discuss the long-term impacts of Covid-19 in order to better understand, prepare and prevent it.

The NHS similarly prepared a detailed briefing note in August 2020 estimating that 60,000 people in the UK were expected to experience persistent or permanent physical health problems similar to previous coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS.

Whilst the understanding of the long-term health impacts of Covid-19 in adults and children was growing behind the closed doors of scientific advisers and public health departments, the complete absence of public information and government advice created a vacuum which patients, parents and carers were forced to fill.

Long Covid is a patient-made term created by patients using social media to find solidarity and share their experiences of suffering the long-term health impacts after infection of Covid-19.

The first posts on social media about protracted symptoms of Covid-19 were published in March 2020, closely followed in the traditional media. There was no government recognition or published advice on long Covid at this time. It was left to the long Covid groups to mobilise and advocate decision-makers for recognition of long Covid.

It was only on 7 September 2020 that the first official government guidance on the long-term effects of Covid-19 were published by Public Health England. The Inquiry will surely wish to examine the unique and significant role that patient advocacy was forced to play in the recognition and response to long Covid, the second framework question, and in turn to explore why the government delayed publicly recognising long Covid.

The early recognition of long Covid amongst scientists, clinicians, public health bodies, patient advocates and even the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care is clear. Against this backdrop, the evidence paints an entirely incongruent picture from the corridors of power in Westminster.

In October 2020 while the DHSC was publishing guidance on long Covid and called for recognition and support for people with long Covid, then Prime Minister Boris Johnson scrawled in capitals that long Covid was "bollocks". Mr Johnson has admitted in his witness statement that he didn't believe long Covid truly existed, dismissing it as "Gulf War syndrome stuff".

The Inquiry will be concerned to probe how the former Prime Minister could possibly hold this view in October 2020, when SAGE, NERVTAG, DHSC, NHS, the WHO, and patient advocates around the world had recognised and registered the risk that long Covid was already posing with its own unique global ICD classification of the disease.

The Inquiry will no doubt wish to carefully scrutinise whether the science was followed.

It is perhaps noticeable that the former Prime Minister now accepts that long Covid is a serious health condition, but does not say when he changed his mind.

I'm sure, my Lady, you will be fully cognisant that adults and children were and still are suffering from debilitating, painful and terrifying symptoms for months and now years after infection, as we saw in the film earlier this morning, and yet Mr Johnson denied the truth of their suffering.

The UK's senior most decision-makers were dismissing, diminishing and disbelieving the very existence and risk of long Covid. This inevitably led to inaction and a failure to protect the UK public from long-term harm to their health. That failure was three-fold:

First, a failure to monitor and collect data on long Covid.

Second, a failure to integrate the risk of harm from long Covid into decision-making.

Third, a failure to communicate the risk of long Covid to the general public.

The surveillance and monitoring of long-term sequelae is foundational to understanding its nature, severity and prevalence, yet seems to have been overlooked. The Inquiry will hear evidence to answer the third framework question, whether there was data collection and modelling of long Covid.

From the very outset of the pandemic, even though there was a foreseeable risk of long-term sequelae, the government focused only on the twin metrics of deaths and hospitalisations.

Professor Chris Whitty admits that initial planning for Covid-19 took no account of long-term impacts of Covid-19. The long Covid groups are concerned to understand why the gap in data monitoring wasn't remedied sooner. They ask why, on 7 May 2020, when SAGE 34 identified the existence of longer term health sequelae and the importance of monitoring these impacts, was data not immediately sought by government decision-makers.

It was left once again to patient advocates to draw decision-makers' attention to this chasm in data monitoring. Patient advocates gave evidence on the need to collate data on long Covid in August 2020. However, it was only on 1 April 2021, one entire year after SAGE had noted the importance of monitoring long-term sequelae, that ONS began publishing the first statistics on the prevalence of long Covid. Delay and dissonance continued to define the government's response.

The ONS published its last bulletin on the prevalence of self-reported long Covid in March 2023 and had stopped collecting and publishing data. This is despite currently rising numbers of Covid-19 infections and where long Covid continues to be a current major health problem. So the long Covid groups are gratified to learn that the ONS has just announced a winter study on Covid-19 infections, which will include the impact of respiratory infections including long Covid.

The fourth question we ask is whether the prevalence and risk of long Covid was taken into account in decision-making on NPIs.

The only way to avoid long Covid is to avoid contracting Covid-19. The possibility of long-term damage to health should have been and surely must be a relevant factor. It was not simply a case of considering metrics for deaths and hospital admissions or balancing, in a binary assessment, the risk of harm the virus posed to the elderly and vulnerable against a risk of harm measures posed to the younger population. There is a fundamental third metric that affects children and adults: that's of long-term morbidity.

A government that was considering the long-term health impacts of the virus would have considered the harm that long Covid causes to individuals, the public health burden of people contracting long Covid including to parents and carers, messaging to warn the public against the debilitating health damage long Covid causes, the social and economic cost of workplace absenteeism long Covid causes, the cost of financial support for people with long Covid on sick leave, the extra demands on the social care sector to support people with this debilitating illness, policy implications such as categorising long Covid as a disability in line with the approach taken in the United States in July 2021.

Instead, the evidence before you, my Lady, will demonstrate that tools like the dashboards and CRIPS that decision-makers used didn't include the risk to long-term health. Their analysis of risk was distorted, overlooking the very real impact of long-term and disabling health consequences. Professor Whitty acknowledges the shortcomings of not recognising the risk of long Covid, saying that when they did, "it made us more cautious of the effects of Covid-19 in young and otherwise healthy adults as the pandemic progressed".

The failure to integrate the risk of long Covid into pandemic decision-making continued throughout all the lockdowns and into the government's exit strategy in preparing for "Freedom Day".

When we look at the evidence, it prompts the question: was long Covid overlooked or was it dismissed? Minutes from a Covid-O meeting on 5 July 2021 suggest a dismissive attitude to long Covid persisted when it was recorded, alarmingly, that long Covid should not be used loosely, as it described a number of syndromes at a time when personal independent payment claims had reached an all time high.

Twinned with an assessment of decision-making around NPIs is the issue of whether timely and clear public messages were issued so that the public were alert to the risk of long Covid to adults and children. The public cannot protect themselves from risks they don't know about. During the relevant period there appears to have been only one public health video on long Covid released by the DHSC, in October 2020.

The evidence prompts our fifth framework question: how and to what extent did decision-makers warn the public about the risk of developing long Covid and take the disease into account in public health communications?

The distressing experiences of the long Covid groups is one to be heeded and learned from. We hope the Inquiry's important work will ensure that never again will it take thousands of patients to fight for recognition, to strive to be believed for their physical suffering and to advocate for their own safety and protection.

The final and most central question weighing heavily on all those who have suffered from long Covid is whether the government could and should have done more. Was the long-term suffering of nearly 2 million adults and children from long Covid avoidable?

Thank you, my Lady.
