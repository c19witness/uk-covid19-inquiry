11. Submissions on Behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations by Mr Dayle
===================================================================================================

**Mr Dayle**: My Lady, I together with a counsel team of Ms Elaine Banton, Mr Ifeanyi Odogwu and Ms Una Morris, represent the federation of ethnic minority healthcare organisations, FEMHO, and we are led by Mr Leslie Thomas KC, and are instructed by the firm Saunders Law.

As you are aware, FEMHO is a large multidisciplinary consortium advocating on behalf of black, Asian and minority ethnic health and social care workers.

Like others before us, we wish to register our support for your recent ruling in the application by the Cabinet Office under section 29 of the Inquiries Act. We join others in agreement that the Inquiry and the Inquiry alone are best placed to determine what is and what is not relevant to your investigations, and as such what redactions are reasonable on disclosure.

We are grateful that the Inquiry alerted us to a contemplated section 19 application from the Cabinet Office, and for the update provided this morning by Mr Keith KC that this application will not be pursued at this time.

It bears saying, my Lady, that FEMHO will oppose any such application if it were to return at some later point.

From our vantage point, and not being privy to the particulars of these controversies as they unfold, we wish to emphasise an overarching principle that shapes this Inquiry. My Lady, that is the immense scope of your investigative powers under the Inquiries Act.

This principle is illustrated in the case law, and one example comes from the Leveson Inquiry, and is the case of Associated Newspapers Limited v Leveson from 2012, where the Administrative Court validated the Chairman's jurisdiction to determine the terms under which witnesses could testify, more specifically in conditions of anonymity.

In their judgment, the Administrative Court pronounced:

"Above all, it is of the greatest importance that the Inquiry should be, and seen by the public to be, as thorough and balanced as is practically possible.

"...

"The public interest in the Chairman being able to pursue the terms of reference as widely and deeply as he considers necessary is of the utmost importance."

This decision of the Administrative Court confirms, my Lady, that you are entitled to shape the course of this Inquiry, and take the appropriate steps to ensure that your investigations are as robust and as fair as possible.

Part of your role as Chair includes protecting and upholding the duty of candour, which is also crucial to maintaining the Inquiry's integrity. This duty, emanating from the Latin word "candor", meaning purity or sincerity, denotes an obligation for public servants to act with honesty and transparency. In the context of this public inquiry, it refers to the compulsion of public bodies and public officials to be open and transparent about their actions, decisions and any errors or failures that may have occurred.

My Lady, your ruling on the Cabinet Office's section 21 application also acknowledges the important link between openness and transparency and the right of core participants and the wider public to effective participation in this Inquiry.

The government's initial response to the pandemic forms an important focal point of this Inquiry. There is a well-established public concern, as you astutely noted, regarding former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's initial reaction to the emergence of Covid. Did the UK Government meet its systematic obligations during the pandemic? Should they have taken more positive and protective steps to safeguard lives? These questions are fundamental to our understanding of the government's approach to the Covid-19 threat.

From information that is already in the public domain, it is clear that the attitude and curiosity of our leaders about the emergency of Covid-19 played a critical role in the early stages of the pandemic.

This was at a time when, quite literally, government decision-making was a matter of life and death. The scope of your investigation in Module 2, my Lady, ought necessarily to be wide and deep and you are entitled to pursue the lines of inquiry that will answer the questions of core participants and the public.

On the points of canvassing evidence, we ask the Inquiry to confirm whether the widest range of communication evidence from social media communication platforms has been requested from the Cabinet Office. This includes communication on less obvious media platforms such as Signal and Telegram. We note as well that, in some instances, the Inquiry's Rule 9 questions to some senior public officials have been published in various press outlets and, as Ms Campbell pointed out earlier, on Twitter.

In light of this, we invite you, my Lady, to publish the complete set of Rule 9 requests so that there is a complete picture of areas of inquiry in your investigations.

FEMHO submits that the key questions underpinning Module 2 are, firstly, did central government perceive the pandemic as a national threat necessitating the invocation of a public emergency? If so, did this framework inform and shape its decision-making process? Areas of possible inquiry include the apparent suspension of the public sector equality duty, alongside what appears to have been a pattern of decisions not to report Covid-19 deaths under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrence Regulations, or RIDDOR.

The legality of any such actions under conditions of a public emergency would be questionable without an official declaration of derogation under Article 15 of the ECHR. A potential infringement on legality emphasises the importance of thorough investigation.

Secondly, we submit that the role of societal factors, including government decisions, in perpetuating adverse racialised outcomes is a pressing area of enquiry for Module 2. In the previous preliminary hearings, structural racism has been recognised as an important lens through which to assess government decision-making.

FEMHO welcomes the identification of an expert on structural racism to guide the Inquiry in this complex terrain, and we note the names that have been mentioned by Mr Keith's remarks this morning.

As set out in our written submissions, given the limited time between now and the start of evidential hearings, we consider it would be most time efficient if CPs were given sight of the draft instructions to these experts and the opportunity to make observations on the scope of those instructions instead of waiting for sight of the draft reports.

We also note Mr Keith's observations regarding witness evidence and the Inquiry's laser focus on high-level government decision-making. We welcome his observation that the Inquiry will be calling a wide range of witnesses, including from bereaved minority and marginalised groups. We invite the Inquiry to consider calling witnesses from FEMHO's large multidisciplinary membership of health and social care workers precisely on this issue and in this module, because the impact of government decision-making on FEMHO's members at the time those decisions were taken is particularly illustrative on the soundness of these decisions. It would also assist the Inquiry, we submit, in forming a view about the decisions that should reasonably have been taken in the circumstances.

This Inquiry should delve into how and why government decision-making, both at the central and local level, failed to adequately consider, anticipate or address the inequality that was exacerbated by the pandemic. It must scrutinise why the government failed to protect against the disproportionate deaths and poor health outcomes suffered by ethnic minority healthcare and social care workers and their wider communities.

FEMHO believes that it is only through confronting uncomfortable and inconvenient truths that we can hope to achieve real change and ensure that such failings are never repeated.

Turning now to matters of procedure, we welcome Mr Keith's confirmation that our proposal for a comprehensive system of cross-module disclosure has been considered and that a system will be put in place to ensure that this is available during this module.

On another matter of procedure, FEMHO is concerned by the lack of express reference to questions pertaining to structural racism and racial inequalities in the provisional list of issues, or indeed the public sector equality duty.

In this regard, we support remarks made earlier this morning by Ms Maragh on behalf of the Bereaved Families for Justice. Without express reference, FEMHO considers that there is a real danger that opportunities to properly investigate the issue will be overlooked or missed. This is an issue of critical importance that raises unique questions and considerations and must, FEMHO submits, be considered in isolation rather than grouped alongside all the other heads of inequalities.

We also wish to highlight concerns about the potential timing implications for evidential hearings arising from witnesses, experts, Rule 9 requests, and the list of issues. There is a strong possibility that key disclosure, including witness statements, continuing into July may identify individuals not included in the provisional list due in June. We seek confirmation that June will not be the final opportunity for CPs to submit additional relevant names.

Furthermore, my Lady, we have previously offered comprehensive feedback on experts and the provisional list of issues, including specific observations on the draft expert reports of Professors Hale and Henderson. We await your indication on how our feedback has been incorporated as soon as possible.

My Lady, with significant disclosure yet to be released, there is a genuine risk that there may be insufficient time to fill any identified gaps. We support the submissions by Ms Heaven earlier this morning on behalf of the Bereaved Families for Justice Wales regarding Rule 9 requests. We suggest that the Inquiry provides full visibility of Rule 9 requests to CPs now, allowing for earlier identification of relevant documents not included in the requests. This will give the Inquiry adequate time to procure and consider any such documents, ensuring a comprehensive and thorough investigation.

In my penultimate point -- and we can take this briefly -- we wish to associate ourselves with the respectful and nuanced submissions that have been made in respect of the issue of your sitting with a panel, my Lady.

As you are aware, we raised this issue in our written submissions and we will not seek to rehearse these matters at this point.

So in closing, my Lady, FEMHO is strongly of the view that the public has a right to know the decisions that were made by government during the pandemic, the actions that were taken, and the errors that indeed might have occurred. We believe that only through this process can we learn, grow and ensure that we are better prepared for the next pandemic.

My Lady, we are grateful for your leadership in this Inquiry, and we stand ready to support your efforts in the pursuit of answers.

Unless there are any issues arising, my Lady, those would be our submissions at this time.

**Lady Hallett**: Extremely helpful, Mr Dayle, thank you very much indeed.

We'll take a break now, and I shall return at 3.45, when I'm going to hear from Ms Marina Sergides -- sorry, I hope I've pronounced it correctly -- and then we will hear from Ms Henke, Ms Drysdale and Mr Chapman.

Thank you very much.

*(3.28 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(3.45 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Right. Ms Sergides.
