13. Submissions on Behalf of the Welsh Government by Ms Henke
=============================================================

**Ms Henke**: My Lady, I'm behind the pillar, I don't think you have a direct line of sight, but I am here and I can see you on a screen.

**Lady Hallett**: Okay.

**Ms Henke**: My Lady, prynhawn da, good afternoon. These are the brief oral submissions on behalf of the Welsh Government.

My Lady, the Welsh Government reaffirms its commitment to this Inquiry. It intends to fulfil that commitment. The Welsh Government wants to reassure the Inquiry and the core participants that we wish to work collaboratively with the Inquiry providing the disclosure, the evidence and the information requested of us. We have heard what has been said by the Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru about our participation in Module 1. The Welsh Government wish to reassure the Inquiry and the families of the bereaved that we are working with the Inquiry and will continue to work with the Inquiry to provide such evidence as is required to enable there to be a full and comprehensive Inquiry.

My Lady, the Welsh Government agrees with the submission on behalf of the TUC that the Inquiry will be enriched by a broad range of perspectives from a broad range of witnesses. We support the inclusion of a broad range of perspectives across both Module 2 and Module 2B, the Welsh module.

The Welsh Government is grateful that the Inquiry intends to provide further detail about the relationship and interrelationship between Modules 2, 2A, 2B and 2C. The Welsh Government is conscious that at the moment the majority of the Welsh Government's evidence on intergovernmental working is set out as part of Module 2B and we welcome the indication that there will be appropriate cross-module disclosure.

My Lady will know that the Welsh Government has not been party to any discussions that may have taken place between the Inquiry and the UK Government on the issue of collective responsibility. We wish to emphasise that non-disclosure on the grounds of collective responsibility is not something upon which the Welsh Government wish to make substantive submission, nor is it likely to be an issue that we will raise in this Inquiry.

The Welsh Government is grateful for the update provided by Counsel to the Inquiry on the release of information by the Cabinet Office relating to communication between the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the devolved governments. We look forward to seeing such material as the Chair considers appropriate to share with us and the other core participants.

My Lady, in relation to issues of disclosure of WhatsApp messages, diaries and the like, the Welsh Government intends to fulfil all such requests made of it by this Inquiry without any prior redaction by us. We understand the duty of candour and we intend to be transparent.

My Lady, is there any issue with which I can assist the Inquiry today?

**Lady Hallett**: No, thank you very much indeed, but I think I will pursue the point about having someone speak who is here when I can't see them. It's like having a disembodied voice ...

So thank you very much indeed.

**Ms Henke**: My Lady, I'm grateful, thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Right, and the next, I hope, Ms Drysdale, you're not behind a pillar, are you?

**Ms Drysdale**: Good afternoon, my Lady.
