9. Submissions on Behalf of Save the Children UK, Just for Kids Law and the Children's Rights Alliance for England by Mr Menon
===============================================================================================================================

**Mr Menon**: I'm just waiting for a lectern.

**Lady Hallett**: One lesson learned from today, more lecterns.

**Mr Menon**: Thank you.

My Lady, I appear together with Jennifer Twite of counsel for the children's rights organisations, Just for Kids Law, the Children's Rights Alliance for England and the Save the Children Fund.

I will be brief this afternoon, my Lady, as you have indicated that you have read and considered our written submissions and repetition will not improve them.

There are four short but important points we wish to make today orally.

Firstly, since we drafted our written submissions, the Cabinet Office has applied for a judicial review of your decision declining to withdraw your notice under section 21 of the Inquiries Act 2005, requiring the production of specified documents in unredacted form.

We echo the submissions of other non-state core participants that this is a shocking and unprecedented development which raises serious questions as to the government's genuine commitment to a fearless and thorough Inquiry into its response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

We have no doubt that your legal team will rigorously oppose the Cabinet Office's application in the Administrative Court so that the Inquiry can pursue all necessary lines of investigation and fully discharge its broad terms of reference.

We welcome my Lady's indication today that this unfortunate application for judicial review will not delay the Module 2 evidential hearings that are scheduled to commence on 2 October. We would also welcome some indication, although we recognise that this may be premature, about when in 2024 you anticipate that you will be in a position to publish your Module 2 report.

Secondly, we wrote to your legal team on 11 May with our comments and observations on the proposed Module 2 list of issues, and we await your ruling on this matter.

We are grateful for Mr Keith King's Counsel's clarification this morning as to the Inquiry's likely approach to school closures during Module 2. The only point I wish to reiterate today on this topic is that if you are intending to investigate, pursuant to paragraph 4(a) of the proposed list of issues, whether the right non-pharmaceutical interventions were considered by the government and whether they were used at the right time, then we presume that you will be looking at the full package of measures and non-pharmaceutical interventions deployed by the government, including the high-level decision to close schools for all children except the children of key workers and the most vulnerable children, notwithstanding that there is to be a later module on education and children with evidential hearings probably in 2025.

We would welcome confirmation, if possible, that our presumption is correct and that there is no need for the children's rights organisations to worry about the absence of any mention of children or school closures in the list of issues, given the list is intended to be indicative as opposed to exhaustive.

Thirdly, we understand that you have not been persuaded, my Lady, that Sir Gavin Williamson, Secretary of State for Education from July 2019 to September 2021, should be sent a Rule 9 request during Module 2.

This, to be blunt about it, is disappointing. Exploration of the broad reasons for high-level political and administrative decision-making on school closures surely requires evidence from Sir Gavin Williamson. Given the Secretary of State for Education must have played a significant part in the government's decision to close schools, we are struggling to understand why he is not at the very least being sent a Rule 9 request during Module 2.

It may be, on receipt of his witness statement, should a Rule 9 request be made, that you conclude that there is no need for him to be called live during Module 2 and that his evidence can legitimately be postponed until the later module on education and children. However, until you have considered his witness statement, and in particular his exact role in high-level decision-making on the issue of school closures, how can such a decision sensibly be made? Consequently, we urge you to reconsider.

Finally, Every Story Matters. After Ms Twite concluded her oral submissions on behalf of the children's rights organisations at the second Module 2 preliminary hearing on 1 March, you made the following observation, and I quote:

"As far as the comment you make about ensuring that children are heard, yes, I totally and utterly believe in that. I also, as I think you've heard me say before, believe in acquiring or obtaining accounts from children as soon as possible. I have done a lot of work involving child witnesses over the years, and I know how memories can fade. Adult memories can fade but it is even more important with young children to get their accounts recorded as soon as possible, and I promise you I have given specific instructions to the team to that effect. So we will do what we can. But I appreciate it must be frustrating when months are going past and you can't see the result as yet, but I hope you will be able to learn the answers to some of your questions very soon."

A few weeks later, at an Every Story Matters webinar on 23 March, a member of the Inquiry team stated that, and I quote:

"There are a number of issues around engaging with children and young people, and some quite high bars to reach in terms of safeguarding and protections. We are working with experts in children and young people's engagement and participation, and hopefully will be able to update people shortly on progress with that."

Today is 6 June, another three months have passed. Mr Keith King's Counsel stated this morning that the Inquiry is developing plans to ensure we understand the experiences of children and that those plans will shortly be brought to my Lady's attention for your consideration.

With all due respect, this is precisely what the Inquiry has been saying since the first preliminary hearing last October. We are still in the dark as to what, if anything, is happening behind the scenes. On the information we have been given, it appears that little or no progress has been made, since you acknowledged the importance of children being heard in March, to ensure that the United Kingdom's more than 14 million children will not remain voiceless during the Listening Exercise.

The children's rights organisations are justifiably, with all due respect, worried that without a swift action by the Inquiry to ensure the effective participation of children, the window will close and it will be too late. Without capturing the testimony of children's first-hand experiences of lockdown, it will be impossible to learn lessons from the decisions made during the pandemic that impacted our youngest so heavily, and mitigate some of the negative impact that the pandemic inflicted on children.

We would welcome an update as a matter of urgency and a clear timetable on when Every Story Matters intends to make provision for children and allow them to exercise their fundamental right to participate in the Listening Exercise. And I stress the words "the right to participate". Merely understanding the experiences of children or holding focus groups is not enough. We ask my Lady to give an unequivocal undertaking that all children who wish to participate in the listening exercise will be given an opportunity to do so, just as adults have been, otherwise Every Story Matters is, in reality, every adult story matters, and that simply isn't acceptable.

My Lady, those are our submissions on behalf of the children's rights organisations.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Menon. I accept entirely the force of your remarks about capturing the memories of children, and I undertake to pursue that issue urgently. Again, I have pursued it in the past. Maybe I should have pursued it even more, and I shall do so today. I undertake to do so. So thank you very much. And the other matters that you raise are obviously also very important. I will also take those into account.

**Mr Menon**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Mr Jacobs.
