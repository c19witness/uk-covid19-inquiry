15. Submissions on Behalf of the Association of Directors of the Cabinet Office by Mr Chapman
=============================================================================================

**Mr Chapman**: My Lady, it's always my pleasure to represent the Cabinet Office.

For the purposes of today's hearing, I intend to focus on the following five areas: the provision of WhatsApp messages; the provision of Google Spaces messages; provision of records of calls with the devolved administrations; Cabinet collective responsibility; and matters relating to the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

So if I can take those in turn, starting with WhatsApp messages.

As you know, my Lady, the Cabinet Office has been supporting a large number of witnesses to whom the Inquiry has made requests for information. To date, it has provided 21 individual witness statements in Module 2, with a substantial body of accompanying disclosure.

The Inquiry's Rule 9 requests for evidence to witnesses in Module 2 have included a request for disclosure of WhatsApp and other messages about the UK Government's response to Covid-19. The Cabinet Office has been assisting the witnesses it is supporting to provide all such messages.

Despite extensive dialogue and all best endeavours to reach agreement, there has emerged a regrettable but genuine difference in legal opinion between the Inquiry and the Cabinet Office as to whether it's necessary to provide messages which are unambiguously irrelevant to the Inquiry's work. For today's purposes, it would be inappropriate for me to do anything more than acknowledge that difference and to note that it will be resolved elsewhere.

In the meantime, and notwithstanding that legal difference, the Cabinet Office continues to work extremely hard and at pace to assist witnesses to disclose all WhatsApp messages which are not unambiguously irrelevant to the Inquiry's work.

Well over 1,000 pages of messages have been provided to the Inquiry, with more to follow shortly.

The Cabinet Office will continue to keep the Inquiry's legal team updated as to its progress with this work, and it will provide the Inquiry with a further detailed update addressing the position on a witness by witness basis next week.

On Google Spaces, my Lady, in January 2023 the Cabinet Office identified the use of Google Spaces as a method of communication within some Cabinet Office business units. The Cabinet Office has identified a total of 49 Google Space groups in which at least one Cabinet Office Module 2 witness actively participated.

As has been requested, the Cabinet Office has provided the Inquiry with details of the participants and date ranges for each of these groups and, at the Inquiry's request, is prioritising its review of certain groups according to an agreed timetable.

Turning to calls with devolved administrations.

At the end of last week the Cabinet Office provided the records sought by the Inquiry in an unredacted format. As DLUHC -- the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities -- is the responsible department now for these documents and related issues, the Inquiry has agreed to direct any follow-up questions to DLUHC rather than the Cabinet Office.

Can I turn to the issue of Cabinet collective responsibility.

In establishing this Inquiry, the government recognised the unprecedented and wholly exceptional circumstances of the pandemic and the importance of examining as rigorously as possible the actions the state took in response in order to learn all possible lessons for the future.

The government is not currently withholding any information from the Inquiry on the basis of Cabinet collective responsibility and, given the purpose of this Inquiry, the government does not expect to seek any redactions to relevant information due to be disclosed to core participants.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry, can I just check: does that mean at any stage of the Inquiry?

**Mr Chapman**: Throughout the life of the Inquiry, yes.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Mr Chapman**: It has regularly sought the Cabinet Office's assistance in obtaining material from individual witnesses, and the Cabinet Office has throughout sought to facilitate that process.

It has recently obtained, very quickly reviewed and now disclosed to the Inquiry Boris Johnson's notebooks, following a review for national security sensitivities and unambiguously irrelevant material.

The Cabinet Office is of course aware that Mr Johnson has recently indicated a willingness to provide information directly to the Inquiry.

In relation to your team's suggestion that Mr Johnson's notebooks should be returned to him in full, the Cabinet Office is considering its position.

It's particularly cognisant of potential national security issues and, in addition, it reserves its position on whether unambiguously irrelevant material should be provided to the Inquiry by any person in advance of the resolution of the judicial review. It recognises the urgency, and will of course keep the Inquiry informed.

The Cabinet Office is also exploring options to support Mr Johnson in gaining access to the material on his old phone, and will contact him and his legal team as a matter of urgency to agree suitable arrangements. The Inquiry will naturally be kept informed of progress.

So, my Lady, those are the issues upon which I propose to address you.

**Lady Hallett**: Could I ask a couple of questions, Mr Chapman, and if you can't answer them, please say so.

**Mr Chapman**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: Your penultimate point: so the Cabinet Office is in possession of Mr Johnson's notebooks, but because of the point that's going to judicial review, even though Mr Johnson himself says he would reveal them to the Inquiry without redaction, the Cabinet Office is going to apply redactions to somebody else's material? Have I got that right?

**Mr Chapman**: My Lady, the position is that the Cabinet Office is working out its position and it will keep the Inquiry informed.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm sure you'll alert them to the fact that, as everyone's pointed out today, the pressures are growing on all of us.

Can I ask what the position is in relation to the old phone? As I understand it, Mr Johnson could have just handed us the old phone, but neither the Inquiry nor he has the ability to access the data, and so Cabinet Office very kindly are stepping in -- and of course they have the national security issues to consider, which I totally understand -- but do I take it from what you said in the penultimate point, is there going to be any question of redacting whatever we find on the old phone, until the Cabinet Office has resolved its position?

**Mr Chapman**: My Lady, it's the same answer, that the Cabinet Office -- these issues have very recently been brought to the Cabinet Office's attention and it wants to consider its position, but it recognises the urgency in doing so.

**Lady Hallett**: Right.

Can you just explain a little more, Mr Chapman, about the transfer of responsibility to -- I can never pronounce these awful acronyms -- DLUHC? What has gone to DLUHC?

**Mr Chapman**: Under a machinery of government change, earlier or in fact last month, responsibility for devolved administration issues and issues relating to the union of the United Kingdom have been transferred from the Cabinet Office to DLUHC, and with that ownership of the documents, and it's for that reason that Cabinet Office sought to facilitate and indeed itself disclosed the documents that had been sought by the Inquiry in relation to the calls with the devolved administrations.

As indicated, the Inquiry or your team will take any further issues forward with DLUHC. They're now the owner within government of the documents and related issues.

**Lady Hallett**: And this machinery of government change took place, what, this year?

**Mr Chapman**: There have been two machinery of government changes during the relevant period, the most recent one being last month.

**Lady Hallett**: Well, at some stage I may wish to go into whether that's caused any delay or the purpose of it. Somebody will know if they've ever read anything I've written by way of judgments or rulings. I do sometimes object to change for change's sake, or for other reasons.

Okay, thank you, Mr Chapman, those are all the questions I will ask at this stage.

Please do convey the message -- I know you will -- that we really are all of us under pressure and the more delay there is, the greater the pressure on everybody, and that includes not only the Inquiry team and me, but all the representatives for the core participants and those they represent.

**Mr Chapman**: My Lady, that message is well understood by those instructing me. The Cabinet Office is itself extremely eager to do everything it can to ensure that the timetable does not slip.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Chapman.

Mr Keith.
