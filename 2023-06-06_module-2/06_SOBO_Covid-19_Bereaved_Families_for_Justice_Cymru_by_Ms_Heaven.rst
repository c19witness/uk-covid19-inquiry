6. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru by Ms Heaven
======================================================================================

**Ms Heaven**: Thank you, my Lady. I only intend to make very brief submissions, and you will be glad to hear that I'll finish well before the lunch break, and thank you for hearing me now.

My Lady, as you know, I represent the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru. Many of those whom I represent are not able to be here today, but they are, as you will be aware, watching and listening intently.

My Lady, can I first address the recent decision of the Prime Minister that you will not be sitting with a panel. We understand that the Prime Minister is apparently concerned about the length of time this Public Inquiry will take to reach its conclusions. My Lady, we know from being involved in Module 1 that this Inquiry is working at breakneck speed. My Lady, we know that you are determined to avoid unnecessary delays because you have recognised the importance of learning lessons as soon as possible, and those whom I represent fully support this approach.

My Lady, a thorough, rigorous and properly informed public inquiry should not be placed at risk out of a concern for public criticism about delay. My Lady, we of course do not question your thoroughness in these proceedings to date. However, we do consider that a panel is going to be essential in later stages of this Inquiry, particularly when considering the instruction of further experts.

It should not lead to delay if appropriately managed. Indeed, it should speed things up. The reason we raise this issue now, of a panel, is to ensure that there is a proper understanding of devolution and the impact of Covid-19 in the devolved nations. As you know, Wales, unlike Scotland, does not have its own public inquiry, and as you know, in Module 1 we have expressed some concerns that many of the draft expert reports are largely insufficient in their consideration of the devolved nations. We continue to submit that this Inquiry and you, my Lady, would be significantly assisted by panel representatives for each devolved nation.

Now, of course, this decision, we understand, is not a matter for you, it's a matter for the Prime Minister. We are aware that you consulted with the Prime Minister, or he consulted with you, prior to his announcement, so we therefore simply ask that you consider inviting a further discussion of this issue with the Prime Minister, in particular well in advance of the devolved nations' specific modules and in the case of Wales.

If that process is to happen, we would value the opportunity to be kept informed so that our members can have an opportunity to further express and develop their views and concerns to the Prime Minister through you in a timely and constructive fashion.

Briefly, in respect of Rule 9 matters, I wish to make the following submissions: my Lady, you've ruled against the release of Rule 9 requests to core participants and we note that Mr Keith has raised this matter again today and made clear that your decision remains. However, we do wish to raise this topic once again in light of the deficient and, quite frankly, wholly inadequate witness statements that have been produced by some members of the Welsh Government for Module 1. The vast majority of these witness statements have simply failed to address, in sufficient detail, key aspects of the pandemic planning and preparation in Wales. Many of these statements do set out the Rule 9 questions that have been asked and on occasion the Inquiry has unfortunately, it appears, not asked sufficiently detailed questions.

This has allowed certain very senior ministers in the Welsh Government to simply not address key aspects of their political life when they would or ought to have known about pandemic planning in Wales. This risks there being gaps in the Inquiry's knowledge in relation to Wales for Module 1.

Now, clearly the Inquiry is entitled to assume compliance with the duty of candour, but unfortunately, certainly in the case of Wales in Module 1, some of the Inquiry's very broad rule 9 questions have led to vague answers, often lacking in sufficient detail.

In order to avoid further statements having similar flaws in Module 2 -- and obviously, from our perspective, in Module 2B -- and to save the Inquiry chasing witnesses for multiple amended statements, we would ask again that some consideration is given to core participants being able to at least feed in to Rule 9 requests, or the questions that your Inquiry team draft, so that potential topics for inclusion can be raised at the earliest possible opportunity with the Inquiry.

My Lady, as you know, many of those whom I represent were involved in their professional capacities with the Welsh Government, NHS Wales, and other institutions associated with the pandemic and the response, and we will be able to use this knowledge to flag to the Inquiry certainly discrete relevant areas that ought to be asked about in the Rule 9 process.

My Lady, in respect of disclosure, we make the following short points: we invite the Inquiry legal team to clarify the dates by which core participants can expect witness statements and other materials to be disclosed. As you know, in Module 1 many statements have undergone revision, in part due to some of the concerns about lack of detail that I've just mentioned. As a result, in Module 1, core participants with very little time -- it's left us with very little time to review material prior to the substantive hearing beginning in a week's time, and certainly in Wales we're still waiting for key disclosure.

In order to avoid a repeat of this situation in Module 2, we simply ask you to clarify as soon as possible whether the deadline that you provisionally set out at the end of July 2013 for outstanding disclosure is a hard deadline, and that would be for the final versions of statements to be released and also to inform core participants of the volumes of statements that can be anticipated around this date.

My Lady, we welcome Mr Keith's indication a moment ago that the Inquiry will keep core participants informed of issues of non-compliance with your requests. My Lady, we therefore ask the Inquiry to clarify whether the concerns around the production of material by a number of government departments in Module 2 includes Welsh governmental bodies. As I have already indicated, we are concerned that in Module 1 the Welsh Government does not appear to have been engaging with the Inquiry to a satisfactory degree. If this is the position in relation to Module 2, then we consider that the Welsh public should be told.

In respect of the Cabinet Office issue, those whom I represent offer you their full support, and clearly endorse the very powerful submissions that have been made today on behalf of the other bereaved family groups. As, my Lady, you will understand, the devolved administrations will be watching these latest proceedings very closely, because there is no doubt that they will also hold large quantities of WhatsApp and other communications that they will not want to disclose to you.

On that point, my Lady, can we ask for clarification whether the Welsh Government has also been asked to disclose all WhatsApp messages and related communication, and an indication of their response?

As with the other bereaved groups, the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru reiterate the central importance of all bereaved families having confidence in this Inquiry, and my Lady, those whom I represent understand that you are taking all the necessary steps to ensure that this remains the case.

We note what Mr Keith has said today in respect of applications for a restriction order. In the event that there is an application, we suggest, as we've done in writing, that core participants should be permitted to make written and oral submissions on the procedural approach to be adopted, to determine such applications and to grant the right to be heard on the substance of each application.

We understand from what's been said today that this is a matter which is to be determined at a later date, subject of course to an application being made.

In respect of the disclosure of materials relevant to Whitehall's engagement with the devolved administrations, we were deeply concerned to note that such disclosure has been delayed. Mr Keith touched a moment ago on cross-disclosure between the modules. In respect of Wales, it would assist in Module 1, which of course is looking at the system for communication between the United Kingdom Government and the devolved administrations, to see how communication actually then unfolded in Module 2.

So, in summary, we ask that these communications are disclosed, if they've not already been disclosed, as a matter of urgency.

Briefly on expert witnesses, we note that for Module 1 many of the expert reports were in draft when the evidence proposals were circulated by the Inquiry. This naturally created difficulties for core participants, not knowing what the final expert report would say. Therefore, in Module 2 we ask you to introduce a deadline for the service of final expert reports to ensure that they are then served in advance of your CTI's evidence proposals.

As to the substance of the draft expert reports, we once again do raise a concern at the level of detail and analysis in these reports in relation to Wales. As you know, we've raised concerns about the lack of specificity and the limited comparison between the devolved nations and frequently a distinct lack of analysis of the communication and interaction between the devolved governments and the UK Government. We obviously therefore look forward to receiving the finalised expert reports, which we very much hope will contain more analysis in relation to the issues that I've just highlighted. Finally, my Lady, the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru once again offer their continued support to the commemoration and to Every Story Matters, and they wish to make clear to you today that they will continue to work with your team in developing your understanding of the experience of the bereaved families of Wales.

Thank you very much.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Heaven. I'm very grateful for your offers of support as well.

Right, could we return, please, at 2.15.
