4. Submissions on Behalf of Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Ms Campbell
===================================================================================================

**Ms Campbell**: Thank you, my Lady.

My Lady, I'm grateful, once again, for the opportunity to address you on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice. Our clients are not able to be here in person, although some of them look forward to attending in person next week, but I know many are following online or will catch up online, and they will have listened with interest to the observations that they will have just heard.

You know, my Lady, the very real engagement that our group leads, and indeed all of our bereaved families wish to have, and the very real support that we have shown your Inquiry as it has progressed. And you also know, and have articulated, the very real need for all the bereaved families to ensure that this Inquiry is meaningful, is thorough and is as effective as possible in scrutinising the evidence.

What that means for us in real terms is allaying rumour and suspicion, is identifying good practice, is exposing bad practice, and is ensuring insofar as humanly possible that lessons are learned so that during any future pandemic, for there is sure to be one, fewer suffer the great loss that so many of those whom we represent suffered in the last one, and we know you share those objectives, as indeed do your team.

My Lady, we're conscious that this preliminary hearing falls at a time when you and your team are undoubtedly overwhelmed with work, firstly in preparation for Module 1 commencing next week, as well as suffering the very real and significant diversion of resources as a result of the satellite litigation launched in the Administrative Court by the Cabinet Office.

It is testament to your commitment to overcome each obstacle that we are here today, keeping marching forward, notwithstanding those recent threats that challenge, as is put in the CTI note, or threaten to disrupt the Inquiry's progress, and we're grateful that you've given us this time today, notwithstanding those very real and competing demands.

Perhaps it's appropriate that I use some time at the start then to commend the Inquiry's work, and may I do so in two particular areas, although they have in common the reality that the Northern Ireland bereaved families learned about them and the detail of them online and through publications rather than through any actual participation in the Inquiry's process -- and for the moment that is not, if I may say so, a criticism.

Firstly, like the UK team, the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice unreservedly commend your ruling on the Cabinet Office attempt to persuade you to accept the argument that the provision of pre-filtered, pre-determined, pre-redacted documents satisfies its duties of disclosure and are consistent with its duty of candour.

The argument that those whose actions or inactions are to be scrutinised in this Inquiry should also be permitted to pre-determine what may be relevant is a bold one, and it is one that we submit was and ought rightly to be swiftly and roundly rejected.

That must be particularly so in an inquiry of this magnitude and of this public importance, before the most experienced of judges, and with, amongst other functions, a duty to interrogate the detail of government response, so as at least in part to restore public confidence in governance during a pandemic.

It is, we contend, unfortunate, some of those whom I represent might say offensive, that the bereaved families who look to this Inquiry to provide answers see the Cabinet Office not working constructively with the Inquiry in the application of your ruling and instead persisting to rally against it. The Cabinet Office's argument that you were asking too much of them really does ring hollow to those whose loved ones paid the ultimate price.

And it's particularly unfortunate, as has just been observed by my learned friend Ms Maragh, that notwithstanding that this issue has been a live one for as many as six months and, in real terms, for a great deal longer than that, because the requests you have made were obviously always going to be made, it is unfortunate that the Cabinet Office has allowed or enabled a situation wherein this dispute has overshadowed the work towards the Inquiry opening next week and is in fact now to be resolved by the Administrative Court right in the middle of those Module 1 hearings.

The damage that has already been done to public confidence is written large across media outlets, but the tolerable that it is taking on the Northern Irish bereaved, largely hidden behind closed doors and expressed over kitchen tables from which loved ones are absent, is really immeasurable.

My Lady, your team has the full support of the Northern Irish bereaved in resisting the application for judicial review. The arguments raised against your ruling are, we contend, unsustainable in law and, I'm afraid, ill considered in their practical effect and should be rejected.

The second issue on which we commend you, my Lady, is another to which we have had our attention drawn through the media, in this case through Twitter.

We have, as my Lady knows, for many, many months sought to persuade you to disclose the detail of Rule 9 requests that have been issued to individuals and organisations, and it was something of a revelation last week to discover the detail of many of the questions apparently posed to the former Prime Minister, Mr Johnson, had been publicised and circulated on Twitter.

How it is that media obtained copies of the questions that core participants were denied is perhaps a question for another day, but it is right that we applaud those questions, if indeed they were posed. Whilst the medium in which they were revealed was perhaps of little reassurance, it was plain from reading those Twitter feeds that the questions posed by you and your team to the former Prime Minister are clear, unambiguous and reflect a great many of the concerns of the bereaved families. It remains to be seen, of course, how forthright the answers are when they come.

But, my Lady, those two issues really serve to highlight the primary and interrelated concerns of the Northern Ireland bereaved families on the approach to the Inquiry and to Module 2 in particular.

Firstly, we are concerned to know that the Inquiry has access to all potentially relevant disclosure related to its very broad terms of reference, and, secondly, the question is to what extent will the Inquiry permit the Northern Irish bereaved to actively and effectively participate in this process.

In relation to that, we have a number of observations, I think four or five in number.

Firstly, it is deeply disappointing that the Inquiry continues to be faced with inadequate or delayed responses to requests for statements and other material. We have previously in written and oral submissions raised concerns that the approach of the Inquiry to witness evidence in this module, and indeed in Module 1, is top heavy, and we understand why that is, and why the primary requests for the accounts of government ministers or departmental corporate statements have been made. But of course sometimes when you ask for corporate statements what you get in response is the corporate line.

We note that this concern finds additional force in the written submissions before you this morning, my Lady, particularly from the TUC and indeed from others. They are concerns that we still hold firm, and the continuing delays around receipt of statements and accounts of individuals in government departments really serves only to exacerbate them.

Secondly, the manner in which the absence or inadequacy of statements is being addressed by the Inquiry, we submit, denies the families and indeed the public the knowledge as to who it is that is doing the obfuscation, to what extent that is happening, and why it might be.

My Lady, that is not to deny the very considerable work that's clearly going on within your team to address it and to manage it and to marshall the process. But if a corporate statement or a minister's statement is only disclosed to us in its final format, having had to be cajoled or encouraged or even extracted under threat by the Inquiry, to provide an adequate response over many months, we must be permitted insight and a greater degree of insight into that process, because that process in and of itself may well go to the credibility of the evidence that the Inquiry is to publicly hear. It is clearly a matter of public interest, and it almost certainly goes to the sincerity of any professed willingness to learn future lessons.

So while we're grateful for what we have been told, both in writing and indeed today, and we don't underestimate the amount of work that is going on behind the scenes, we submit that the curtain must be raised on this activity in its entirety, we must know the cast who are engaging in this behaviour, and moreover we observe that to give any cover to the behaviour, to allow it to happen in circumstances where we don't know who, what or when, risks encouraging it.

So we ask: who are these actors who are delaying and prevaricating and providing inadequate responses? And allow us, please, to see that process in real time.

Thirdly, my Lady, applying even the greatest optimism, of course all of us in this room must do that, experience dictates that the Inquiry's aim of largely completing disclosure by the end of July is likely, in fact highly likely, not to be met.

Putting to one side the issue of WhatsApp and Google Spaces and the magnitude of data and information that will come, we hope, and come soon, from that source, we only have to look at the response from the Department of Health and Social Care to appreciate where the delays will fall.

I preface my submissions, my Lady, with the observation that undoubtedly a significant burden has been placed on that particular department and that the demands of the Inquiry are undoubtedly resource-intensive.

But, my Lady, corporate statements that were requested in September 2022, nine months later, are yet to be delivered. Nine months. We are told in the submissions that the first statement might be with the Inquiry this week, together with exhibits totalling 890. We are told we can expect its sister statement hopefully towards the end of the month, together with another 400 or so exhibits. A total of almost 1,300 exhibits under cover of two statements that have taken over nine months to put together will be given to the Inquiry in the coming weeks at a time when Module 1 has already commenced, when attention is diverted to a judicial review application, and we are hurtling towards the start date of Module 2. It affords precious little time for this Inquiry to consider them for onward disclosure to core participants, undoubtedly meaning, with the best will in the world and working round the clock within your team, that we will have them for a few comparatively short weeks before the hearings commence.

My Lady, we mean no criticism of you or your team when we observe that that is simply, from our perspective, not good enough. The Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, as we are doing in Module 1, will find ourselves without enough hours in the day to properly prepare for the full hearing if we don't get this material sooner than the timeframe which these departments are allocating to themselves.

Fourthly, my Lady, I note today -- and perhaps I can take this rather shortly -- I was going to observe on the difficulty in identifying really where Northern Ireland fits within this module. We have previously made suggestions on Rule 9 recipients and we have not had any clarity on the extent to which those have been accepted or actioned, but I note that there is to be within the coming days a full list of Rule 9 recipients, and we look forward to receipt of that, and we will work together with your team in relation to it.

We have had precious little Northern Irish-related disclosure. The Cabinet Office had not yet managed to identify disclosure relevant to Whitehall's communication with the devolved administration in the early days of the pandemic and indeed beyond. That came as some surprise but we hope it has been resolved.

If I may, we would ask that, in addition to those requests being made of Whitehall, particularly given the very recent history in relation to disclosure, we would ask that the mirrored requests are made of Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast, so that we can scrutinise the disclosure by way of a complete picture.

The combination of these issues, my Lady, really reinforces the requests that we have been making for some time, some might say the drum that we have been beating. Primary concern is that disclosure is coming too late for adequate consideration. A predictable effect of individuals and government departments running down the clock with internal searches and delays in prevarication is the inevitable reduction of time and resources available for public scrutiny at the other end, and that is increasingly of concern.

My Lady, we reiterate our request, and it will come as no surprise, to have sight of, if not input into, the Rule 9 requests. The revelations on Twitter reinforce that, if I may say so. Having sight of those Rule 9 requests would be, firstly, instrumental in ensuring the families' continued confidence in this process, but secondly they are also likely to be the yardstick by which the answers that come in response to them are measured. And so we do invite you to reconsider disclosure of those requests so that we can compare and contrast the answers that come.

As has already been observed by Ms Maragh, it is important and we know my Lady will hear from bereaved family members as part of Module 2; Module 2, we submit, will be significantly the poorer if it does not hear and listen to those most directly affected, and it's a submission that is echoed by many of the core participants in the room today.

A significant measure of the adequacy of government response is the impact that it had on those most directly affected. We note what Mr Keith has said today by way of update and observations. Any submissions or suggestions that we make going forward in relation to those from whom you should hear will bear in mind at all stages the need to assist the Inquiry's work in this module and on the issues under consideration. But our clients have a great deal to say, and although their experiences and perspectives have been informed by the magnitude of their individual loss, it is not limited to that. So we urge you to take a generous approach to the time allocated to hearing from the bereaved, and indeed from other core participants in civil society, in this module.

My Lady, I need say nothing about the issue of Cabinet collective responsibility, given the update, and we have referred in our written submission to our view of the announcement in relation to panelists. We rely largely on those submissions, but we also join forces with the voices from the Cymru group in observing that the opportunity for you to be assisted by panel members, and particularly those with a detailed knowledge of the devolved administrations, appears to have been missed, in my submission, by the Prime Minister.

But it is not too late. We would strongly urge the Prime Minister, through you, to reflect on that latest decision, to recognise the value that diverse and experienced panel members could bring to this process. And, given what we know to be the problem or the source of delays, it is, we submit, unfortunate for the Prime Minister to rely on perceived criticism around delays as a reason to deny the fullest possible scrutiny.

In relation to the list of issues, my Lady, we endorse and adopt the submissions that you have heard. We had made submissions, specific observations in relation to the interface between this module and Module 2C from a Northern Irish perspective, but we see the sense in Mr Keith's submission this morning that that interface is perhaps best ironed out when the list of issues in relation to Module 2C is closer to its final form. Our work in relation to responding to the Module 2C list of issues is proceeding apace, so that we can respond fully within the deadline, which I think is next week.

My Lady, dealing then just briefly with expert witnesses before concluding on Every Story Matters and the tapestry.

We have been firm supporters of the Inquiry's decision to approach expert witnesses, and we continue to be. We are grateful to Professor Hale and Professor Henderson for the care and detail in their report. The clarity of their report undoubtedly belies the great effort and skill that went into drafting them, but they are inevitably UK-focused and, although there is a nod, and in some cases that is an underestimate, more than a nod, towards Northern Ireland, we submit that more can be gained from their expertise, and it's really in that vein that we have provided detailed responses which are intended to be constructive, and we would ask that both the Inquiry team and indeed the experts view them in that manner.

However, our responses are hampered in two regards. Firstly, because of this habit of not giving us the references upon which they rely, and we're grateful that that observation has been taken forward with the experts. But, secondly, by the ongoing non-disclosure of witness statements from government departments and ministers and indeed others. One practical consequence of that, we submit, is that it may well be, on receipt of further statements, that the experts do need to be asked to consider and comment further; yet another piece of work for those involved in this Inquiry occasioned by the delay.

In relation to Every Story Matters and the tapestry, our concerns have found their voice in those of Ms Maragh. I think it can be summarised in this way: that at present the Northern Irish bereaved do not see their experience of grief or loss or trauma reflected in that tapestry artwork, nor for the moment in the outworking of the Every Story Matters, but we will persist in communicating with your team and those responsible to see how those issues can be resolved. Our clients remain very actively engaged, and my Lady, very willing to assist you in understanding their concerns but also reaching the conclusions that this Inquiry really needs to reach sooner rather than later.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Campbell. In relation to that last point, I mean, I know that when you make offers of help you mean it on behalf of those whom you represent, and going back to the impact film, to which I referred earlier this speaking to Ms Maragh, the first impact film that's been produced, and I do hope will be able -- feel that they can watch it, because it is extraordinarily moving, and we will have to have a number of warnings before it is shown, but it shows a diverse group of bereaved people speaking about their loss in the most extraordinarily moving terms, and, as I said to Ms Maragh, introducing items that I hadn't realised I should be investigating. So it's not only very moving, but also very helpful. And two of the most insightful participants do come from Northern Ireland on that film, so I am extremely grateful for the help that they have given, and I hope it does continue, and we're always prepared to listen. So I hope that message has got across.

So far as the disclosure of the Rule 9 request, as you may know, that was not the Inquiry team that put the Rule 9 request on Twitter. I think Mr Keith may or may not be able to help as to who it was, but it wasn't us.

**Ms Campbell**: I didn't think it was, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: The last point really is in relation to timing. I do understand the very valid points you make about timing and the demands on everybody, the Inquiry team but also core participants. All I can say is that everyone needs to know that, as far as I'm concerned, these hearings for Module 2 will start in October, and so I'm afraid everybody, material providers, legal representatives, they're all going to have to work very hard, I'm afraid. But that's my present position.

So thank you very much for your submissions.

**Ms Campbell**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Right, Ms Mitchell.
