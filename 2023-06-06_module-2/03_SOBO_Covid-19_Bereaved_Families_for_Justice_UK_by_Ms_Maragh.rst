3. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK by Ms Maragh
===================================================================================

**Ms Maragh**: I'm still able to say good morning, my Lady.

I represent the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, along with Pete Weatherby King's Counsel and Anna Morris King's Counsel, instructed by Elkan Abrahamson and Nicola Brook of Broudie Jackson Canter.

My Lady, there are a number of bereaved family members who are present in the Inquiry room, and who are also following the proceedings live.

The Inquiry has received joint statements and some written submissions from ourselves and Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, which, my Lady, we know that you and your team have read and accorded careful consideration, and for that we're grateful.

We're also grateful for your opening update and also Mr Keith's opening remarks.

Additionally, we are grateful for the opportunity to address you orally. Mindful of the time constraints, Ms Campbell King's Counsel, who leads the Northern Ireland team, and I have divided our oral presentation to address the matters that our clients raise.

My Lady, given the importance of the issues and the strength of feeling in our respective client groups, there will inevitably be some overlap. Ms Campbell King's Counsel will lead on devolved issues as well as matters of particular concern to the bereaved families of Northern Ireland.

I will address you on the following topics, in general terms, my Lady: Rule 9 requests, with particular focus on the Cabinet Office issue, disclosure, list of issues, provisional list of witnesses, expert witnesses, Every Story Matters, commemorations and, briefly, my Lady, the Inquiry venue.

The Cabinet Office issue and the redaction of documents.

The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice support your robust approach to evidence gathering, my Lady, and the use of section 21 notice in response to the Cabinet Office's non-compliance with Rule 9 requests, and the Inquiry's disclosure and redaction protocols.

They welcomed your ruling of 22 May, rightly, my Lady, rejecting the Cabinet Office's submissions to discharge the section 21 notice. We agree that the determination of relevance falls to be determined by you.

The families are deeply disappointed that the Cabinet Office is persisting with its legal challenge to your ruling, which the families see as a further step to interfere with the Inquiry's independence and to control the material it receives and what it can and cannot see.

The families also question the purpose for which the redaction process is being used and the Cabinet Office's candour in its responses to the Inquiry's request and notice.

We make two brief observations, my Lady. Referrals to the police forces. It is of note that some of the documents that are the subject of the section 21 notice which were produced to the Inquiry in redacted form are the subject of the Cabinet Office referrals to two police forces, not made at the time of the redactions, but only after the issue of the section 21 notice requiring their production to the Inquiry, and the attempt on May 15 to maintain their non-disclosure.

My Lady, whilst we have not had sight of these documents, we make two further observations in relation to that issue.

Firstly, the fact that the Cabinet Office have apparently referred to them -- to refer some of them to the police indicates that the Cabinet Office itself considers that they may evidence criminal offences.

Secondly, the fact that the Cabinet Office did so only after the section 21 notice was issued also raises serious questions about the redaction process and for which it may have been used.

Turning briefly, my Lady, to the matter of Mr Johnson's WhatsApp messages and notebook, we note Mr Keith King's Counsel's update on the Inquiry's progress with material relating to Mr Johnson, which have further raised questions of transparency on the part of the Cabinet Office response to your Rule 9 request. In relation to the old phone, the families remain concerned that all relevant material is disclosed to the Inquiry.

My Lady, the Cabinet Office is the heart of government and undoubtedly understands that public bodies are obliged in the discharge of their duties to act with candour, an undoubted pillar of good governance.

Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice considers that the Cabinet Office's response to the Inquiry's Rule 9 requests, the redaction and withholding of potentially relevant material from your investigation demonstrates a lack of candour and undermines the sincerity of its statements that it will assist this Inquiry in the discharge of its terms of reference.

Further, the conduct of the Cabinet Office risks delaying your investigation, the progress of this Inquiry, public confidence in the process, and your ability, my Lady, to report and make recommendations in a timely manner.

Quite frankly, it beggars belief that just a week short of the commencement of oral evidence in this Inquiry, your focus, that of your team, and the focus of the bereaved families are being diverted by the Cabinet Office's legal challenge.

My Lady, the conduct of the Cabinet Office rings of obfuscation and, in our view, there could hardly be more compelling evidence for the need for a statutory duty of candour and associated legal tools to enforce it, as called for by a significant number of chairs of previous Inquiries, reviews and a wide number of bereaved family groups, including the Hillsborough families and the Grenfell families.

In the absence of such legal reform, my Lady, we urge the Inquiry to adopt a fully transparent approach to Rule 9 requests in dealing with the challenges to its process.

Additionally, my Lady, position statements requiring proactive identification of issues and material which may be contrary to their interests and requiring senior officials to sign off on disclosure is a potent way of ensuring candour in the current provisions.

In this regard, my Lady, we renew and rely on our previous submissions inviting the Inquiry to request position statements from state and organisational institutions.

Turning, my Lady, to the matter of Cabinet collective responsibility, we note Mr Keith King's Counsel's update that the government may not wish to rely on Cabinet collective responsibility at this stage. That is welcomed news, and in the event that the issue is resurrected in relation to other documents, we would wish to be promptly updated and, my Lady, you have our submissions in relation to process which we say should be maintained.

Turning now to the issue of overdue corporate statements and disclosure. We note the written submissions of the Department of Health and Security(sic) and the UK Health Security Agency, and make the following brief observations.

The decisions and activities of both departments were central to the UK's response to the pandemic, and impacted significantly on the outcomes of those who died, and in effect, my Lady, the bereaved families.

Whilst we do not in any way underestimate the pressures associated with the general preparation for this Inquiry, which is being undertaken alongside the general work of the departments, the response of the Department of Health and Social Care carries a ring of institutional defensiveness, my Lady, blaming the Inquiry from "the request for detailed information for the two-year period of its investigation".

Government departments, including the Department of Health and Social Care and UKHSA, would have known as far back as May 2021, when the public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic was announced, that the actions of government ministers, officials and civil servants would be scrutinised.

Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice would have expected government departments, including the Department of Health and Social Care, to anticipate the need for additional resourcing to meet the rigours of such an investigation.

We note that it is estimated that corporate statements requested by the Inquiry in September of 2022, so over eight months ago, will be submitted to the Inquiry in June along with other statements, including that of Matt Hancock, for Module 2.

We again note Mr Keith King's Counsel's update on disclosure, but remain concerned that the delay in compliance with disclosure requests and resourcing challenges raised by government departments raise real concerns as to the potential impact on the Inquiry's Module 2 timetable.

My Lady, we ask that CPs be updated as to the progress.

Turning now to the discrete matter of cross disclosure raised by core participants. We support FEMHO's submission for CPs to have access to disclosure across modules, and no doubt Mr Dayle will address you further on this matter.

On the issue of expert witnesses, we note CTI's update on expert witnesses and the progress with draft report. The families welcome the confirmation of the Inquiry's instructions to experts on structural racism and inequality. We also welcomed the Inquiry's engagement with CPs on the identification of appropriate experts to assist with this work, to which the bereaved families with expertise in race and health equality contributed. We ask that the Inquiry invites similar input from the bereaved in relation to the drafting of letters of instructions to the instructed experts on structural racism and inequality.

Turning, my Lady, to the provisional list of issues. Once again, my Lady, we welcomed the Inquiry's engagement with CPs on the preparation of the list of issues and await the Inquiry's response to the matters submitted.

Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice urges the Inquiry to list as specific issues for investigation in Module 2 structural racism and inequality, austerity, the treatment of the bereaved, and we support the submissions raised by Long Covid group for the inclusion of long Covid as an issue for investigation in Module 2.

In relation to structural racism and inequality, my Lady, we of course welcome the Inquiry's commitment to investigating the role of structural racism and inequality during Module 2. As you would have noted in our written submissions and previous oral submissions to you, structural racism and the nature of racial inequality across the United Kingdom and its impact on the disproportionate numbers of black and brown people who died during the pandemic warrant distinct analysis. We therefore invite the Inquiry to expressly list the investigation of the impact of structural racism on the outcomes for black and brown people as a specific issue during the investigation of Module 2.

In relation to austerity, we welcome the Inquiry's update that the issue of austerity is being considered for specific investigation in Module 2.

Thirdly, the approach of the deceased and bereaved people. As the Inquiry team are aware, my Lady, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice and Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice have great concern about the treatment of bereaved families and their loved ones, particularly in connection with burial arrangements and the interference with funeral rituals. We seek confirmation, my Lady, that core political and administrative decision-making about these matters will receive appropriate scrutiny in Module 2.

In relation to long Covid, we welcome CTI's update on long Covid and, as I have indicated, my Lady, we support Long Covid groups' submissions that Module 2 should investigate the government's knowledge of and the decisions taken in relation to long Covid, and we specifically support their submissions for the six framework questions to be put to witnesses during Module 2.

Turning, my Lady, to the provisional witness list.

The voice of the bereaved in the Inquiry. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, having campaigned long and hard for the public inquiry, are ever alive, my Lady, to the breadth of your investigation which necessitates the calling of a proportionate number of witnesses. We are mindful of Mr Keith's update, and we will continue to work with the Inquiry team, as we have done in Module 1 and Module 2, to identify suitable bereaved family members to give evidence in Module 2.

Turning now, my Lady, to Every Story Matters.

Our submissions are set out at paragraphs 34 and 36 of our written submissions, and we highlight the following matters: firstly, my Lady, we welcome the Inquiry's update in relation to 23red and seek clarification of the position in relation to the engagement of IPSO(sic) and M&C Saatchi. In relation to the process of Every Story Matters, we remain concerned that the project appears to focus on the collation of themed reports which will be submitted to you as evidence rather than the accounts of the bereaved.

Additionally, the families remain unaware of the expertise and training of those who will be involved in the evidence gathering and those who will be preparing the reports and how the integrity of the online material will be ensured.

My Lady, the reality is this: many of the bereaved families have simply not engaged with Every Story Matters, for the reasons I have set out above.

Turning to commemorations, it remains a real disappointment to the families that the Inquiry has not seen it fit to devise a way of memorialising those who have died, either through a proportionate amount of material heard in the hearings, or by way of online methods, or both.

My Lady, as we have said in previous written submissions and oral submissions to you and representations to your team, the families remain willing to engage with the Inquiry to find a way forward on this issue.

Final topic, my Lady, relates to the venue.

We are grateful, my Lady, for your opening remarks touching on the venue, and we are equally grateful that those remarks were mindful of the concerns raised by the families. We appreciate that the identification of a suitable venue and the fitting of suitable resources and equipment is a balancing exercise. We appreciate that time and resources are not finite, and we trust, my Lady, that you will, in your presiding over the Inquiry, take into account the matters raised by the families.

Unless there are other matters or any other matter that you would wish for me to address you further on, those are my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: If I could just say this, really, rather than ask you to address me further, Ms Maragh: as far as the concerns of the bereaved are themselves concerned, I do understand and I do understand how when people have been demanding an Inquiry and they have to wait for some time, how they can be upset by some of the decisions. But, from my point of view, I have tried my very best, given the constraints upon me, from the very outset of this Inquiry to make sure that the bereaved and those who suffered in other ways have been at the heart of this Inquiry. I have ensured that the team are conscious that the bereaved and others who have suffered will be at the heart of the Inquiry. We are calling as many witnesses as we feel we can in each module from bereaved groups and others, but it has to be consistent with the time constraints upon us and the other matters of relevance.

So I have all these restrictions, but I am doing my best. We have commissioned films from those who have suffered, and in watching the final draft of one of those films just yesterday, I learned of a practice in relation to the burial of a lost loved one that caused me huge concern, and I will ensure that we investigate that matter, which just gives one example of why, if only those whom you represent will contribute to Every Story Matters, I can learn more about issues that I have to explore. So I urge those of you, those whom you represent, to consider carefully before they say we're not doing enough. We are trying, and, with the assistance of groups like yours, then we can do as much as possible. We are holding community events around the country and I hope to attend some of them in person. I don't want just want to say, "I'll just read a report". I know how important it is to hear from people, and as much as time will allow I will go around the country, around the United Kingdom.

We are going to ensure that what people say online is properly considered and fed into the enquiries. So I'm trying in as many ways as we can think reasonably possible to ensure that people who have suffered are at the heart of this Inquiry, and that's all I can say at this stage.

I appreciate you probably don't wish to respond, but I thought I needed to get that off my chest. I'm sorry.

**Ms Maragh**: My Lady, I am grateful. If I may just raise one brief or make one relation in response, and it is this: for Module 1, despite the engagement with the families and representations made, for you to hear from a proportionate number of the families, you're hearing from just one bereaved family across the groups. Now, that, my Lady, does not sit well with the families. So we are encouraged by your response, and we look forward to continued engagement with your team for Module 2 so that you and your team hear live from those who lost their loved ones in this pandemic.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Ms Maragh. I totally support the point you make about engagement. That is the only way the core participants, like Bereaved Families for Justice UK, can participate properly, and I just urge people to think carefully before they say they're going to withdraw their engagement, because it will just make my task even harder.

So thank you very much.

Ms Campbell King's Counsel.
