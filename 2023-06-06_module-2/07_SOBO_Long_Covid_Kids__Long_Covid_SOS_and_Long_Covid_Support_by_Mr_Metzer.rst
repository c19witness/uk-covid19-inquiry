7. Submissions on Behalf of Long Covid Kids, Long Covid SOS and Long Covid Support by Mr Metzer
================================================================================================

**Mr Metzer**: Thank you.

My Lady, I address you on behalf of the Covid

groups. I shall start with specific issues relating directly to our clients, and then turn to wider procedural issues.

My Lady, people with long Covid deserve answers. Mr Keith King's Counsel has said on previous occasions, and I agree, that transparency and public confidence is core to the functioning of this Inquiry, and in the same vein people suffering with long Covid deserve to know what the government knew about the long-term effects of this pernicious disease and what steps, if any, it took when confronted with the reality of huge numbers of people not recovering from it.

I acknowledge Mr Keith's comments today that long Covid will feature in Module 2, despite its total absence from the first draft of the list of issues, and that some Rule 9 requests including questions related to long Covid, but it is extremely disappointing that detailed consideration is planned to be reserved for Module 3 only.

We respectfully suggest that this position still misses the point.

The fact that long Covid will be investigated in the context of healthcare in Module 3 does not obviate the need for a thorough investigation of government decision-makers' recognition and consideration of long Covid.

This is in relation to the spread and transmission of Covid-19. These are matters firmly within the remit of Module 2. This is a crucial and fundamental distinction. Long Covid requires proper examination in this module.

The building blocks of the investigation in this module have been laid down, but most troublingly those blocks have hitherto ignored our clients and their concerns. My Lady, there is a problem which remains unresolved despite months of direct correspondence and repeated pleas to the Inquiry team. The problem, put simply, is that Module 2's whole approach to long Covid has been profoundly flawed. Long Covid was initially overlooked in the context of Module 2. Following our representations, it has been added, seemingly as an afterthought, some Rule 9 requests, but its relevance is still not appreciated. That is evident not least in the approach to expert reports and the draft list of issues.

First, none of the expert reports received to date address long Covid, long-term sequelae or long term morbidity. We are told that the expert reports are drafted at "too high a level" to consider long Covid specifically. This is lamentable. The Inquiry will be deprived of the benefit of expert comparative opinion on the effectiveness of the government policies on preventing and minimising long-term morbidity, and whether there was adequate data collection and proper use to respond to this and long Covid.

Secondly, and even more importantly, the draft list of issues omits any reference to morbidity and long Covid entirely, which has stunned us all. As it stands, long-term morbidity has not been identified as a discrete line of investigation in this module at all. It frames the investigation on decision-making only through the lens of its impact on mortality and hospitalisations. This approach is myopic and far too narrowly defined. It deprives my Lady from examining the impact of decision-making on long-term morbidity and long Covid.

I'm sorry to report that the complete omission of long Covid in the draft list of issues has shaken our confidence in the Inquiry's process. While of course we welcome the comments today that long Covid will be investigated in this module, we cannot express strongly enough our and our clients' frustration at the failure to reference long Covid in the list of issues.

We maintain that long Covid cannot simply be tacked on to the list of issues like an afterthought, but instead should be embedded as a key measure of the adequacy of government and administrative decision-making in the framework, necessarily informing the direction of the Module 2 investigations.

So, my Lady, key foundational blocks to the investigation of long Covid in Module 2 are glaringly missing. Long Covid affects almost 2 million people in the UK, over 3% of the population, and growing, and I say it again, they deserve and are entitled to answers.

We suggest that there are at least six broad framework questions on long Covid which must inform the investigations in Module 2:

1) What decision-makers' understanding of long-term sequelae and long term Covid was.

2) What was the role of patient advocacy in the recognition and response to long Covid?

3) Was data collection and modelling of long Covid measured?

4) Was the prevalence and the risk of long Covid taken into account when decisions like the imposition and then easing of non-pharmaceutical interventions were adopted?

5) How and to what extent did decision-makers warn the public about the risk of developing long Covid and take the disease into account in public health communications?

6) Whether 2 million people with long Covid today was avoidable.

We are grateful for the express support from bereaved families and other core participants. A change in approach needs to start from now, my Lady, to give proper effect to your stated declaration that "investigation of how decisions were made, communicated and implemented will include investigation of how long Covid was considered in decisions on the implementation of lockdown measures".

My Lady, I now turn to procedural matters. We have heard your comments made to Ms Maragh this morning in relation to evidence from affected groups. We understand and sympathise with the immense challenges you face in managing an Inquiry of this size, but we repeat our call for the Inquiry to hear evidence from survivors of long Covid.

Long Covid groups' evidence is essential to this module investigating whether there was a systemic failure by decision-makers in acknowledging and responding to the risks of long-term morbidity. We urge that direct evidence is heard from the Long Covid groups to understand whether their suffering could have been avoided.

In addition, we share the concerns expressed by the TUC, the bereaved families and the bereaved families from Northern Ireland, that the evidence gathering process is disproportionately focused on government evidence. A failure to gather sufficient evidence from organisations outside government may skew the overall picture and prevent adequate scrutiny of the government decision-makers.

My Lady, I addressed you at the last hearing on long Covid being the first illness to be recognised through patient advocacy. As you are aware, our clients were compelled to form into advocacy groups because decision-makers dismissed and overlooked their suffering, causing that to be prolonged and become more pervasive.

I reiterate, they remain willing to speak about their unique experiences of advocating for the recognition of long Covid to ensure the Inquiry is equipped with the full picture. They are not only impact witnesses but also have direct evidence of their advocacy to influence decision-makers. This means they played a direct and significant role in influencing decision-makers to recognise and respond to the risk of long Covid.

My Lady, I rely on our written submissions which set out, hopefully, some constructive procedural suggestions to facilitate preparation for the substantive hearings. Mr Keith's comments this morning have answered many of those points and I do not seek to repeat our submissions. At this stage I have two short additional observations to make.

First, in relation to expert reports, we understand that Module 2 will be relying on the expert report on long Covid commissioned by Module 3. This is welcomed, and we agree that Module 2's investigations will be assisted by expertise on long Covid if this is provided ahead of the Module 2 hearings.

We welcome confirmation that the expert reports from Module 1 of Professor Bambra and Professor Marmot are being disclosed in Module 2. We would repeat our call for the expert reports from epidemiologists from Module 1, namely the reports from Professor Jimmy Whitworth and Dr Charlotte Hammer to be also disclosed to Module 2 core participants.

Secondly, we note Mr Keith's comments this morning that as the Inquiry is moving at pace, decisions will need to be made about what evidence will be called and what questions will be asked. If this leads to the Inquiry limiting the scope of the investigations in Module 2, we ask that this be made clear to all core participants.

I now turn to the wider issue of government departments, particularly the Cabinet Office, and disclosure.

I wish to end on a few short observations on this topic.

Public inquiries concern accountability and are created to restore public confidence and learn lessons. The core tenets of public scrutiny and transparency underpin every public inquiry, none more so than one investigating decision-making in a pandemic that has caused such widespread suffering and damage nationally and worldwide.

It is shocking and frankly appalling that the pillars to this Inquiry have been shaken by the Cabinet Office's continued and wholly unmerited resistance to providing unredacted disclosure and the possible application for wide-ranging restriction orders. It cannot be said honestly that it is in the public interest to only hear half the story. The full story must be shared to ensure that the whole truth comes out.

I note that Mr Keith back at the first preliminary hearing commendably spoke about the "targeted approach" taken with the Cabinet Office disclosure, and even those many months ago stated that internal communications, including WhatsApps including from the Prime Minister, Number 10 and other senior officials, had been requested.

Months later it is highly regrettable that the Cabinet Office is deliberately obfuscating. We are also concerned by media reports of a letter from Cabinet Office to the Right Honourable Mr Johnson MP asking him to submit his witness statements and exhibits to Cabinet Office for redactions to be applied before submission to the Inquiry.

The approach of government to disclosure creates a dangerous precedent of exceptionalism by claiming exceptional processes and procedures for itself which do not apply to any other core participant. It is one rule for them and another for everyone else. The optics are terrible, and seemingly mirror many of the concerns about the government's approach to rules throughout the pandemic.

We are concerned to learn that the Foreign and Commonwealth Department is now echoing the Cabinet Office's approach.

We wish to commend my Lady respectfully for the robust and proper approach you have taken on this fundamental issue. We also endorse the important well-merited points made by my learned friend Ms Maragh for the bereaved families. We recognise that regretfully, as judicial review proceedings are under way, the question of redactions is no longer just a matter for you for now, my Lady. Nonetheless, we wish to express our dismay at the delay and unnecessary extra expenditure this unwelcome litigation has spawned.

The present position is difficult to comprehend, not least because the former Prime Minister, Mr Johnson, has confirmed publicly that he does not object to disclosure of his WhatsApp messages and diaries in unredacted form, and has now belatedly provided some of the material.

Further, we are pleased to note that the question of restrictions and Cabinet collective responsibility may no longer be an issue. We support Mr Keith's request that this be confirmed as soon as possible to avoid further delay in disclosure to the Inquiry and onward to the core participants.

We echo the bereaved families' request to you, my Lady, that if the anticipated section 19 application is made, that it is disclosed to all core participants and that there is a formal process for submissions on the issue to be fully ventilated.

I make two further points connected to issues arising from Cabinet Office's disclosure. First, in respect to Mr Johnson's phone containing messages up until April 2021, he has asked for assistance from Cabinet Office to turn on his phone so that he may review them for relevance. As with all disclosure, we firmly maintain that the Chair and no one else must be the final arbiter of relevance.

Secondly, it may assist to allay any public concerns to have the swift disclosure for the Rule 9 notices sent to Mr Johnson and other members of the government. As Ms Campbell King's Counsel has stated, the contents of Mr Johnson's Rule 9, dated 3 February 2023, has been reported in the press and on social media.

We similarly ask that the core participants, including my clients, who have suffered such harm from this disease, are provided with them through the formal process.

My final observation is that given the current turn of events, it is impossible not to conclude that the government's approach is anything other than seeking to protect itself and those now in power from full and appropriate scrutiny under the wide terms of reference. To allow the Cabinet Office to determine relevance of all the material itself flies in the face of all the objectives and purpose of this Inquiry.

My Lady, that is all I wish to say, unless I can assist you any further.

**Lady Hallett**: No, Mr Metzer, thank you very much indeed. In relation to the list of issues, I had understood that the very valid points that you make were covered, but I will -- having heard the disappointment that you have expressed, and I understand, I will discuss with the team whether greater specificity -- I never say that word -- would be helpful. So I will discuss with them. So thank you for the points you made.

**Mr Metzer**: Thank you, my Lady, I'm much obliged.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Right. Mr Friedman.
