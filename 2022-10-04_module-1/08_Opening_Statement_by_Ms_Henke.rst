8. Opening Statement by Ms Henke
=================================

**Ms Henke**: My Lady, prynhawn Da, ruth Henke on behalf of the Welsh Government.

The Welsh Government would like to take this opportunity to confirm once more its whole-hearted commitment to giving you and your team the fullest possible co-operation in investigating its response to the unprecedented challenges faced by everyone in Wales, every public authority, and every business in Wales as a result of the pandemic.

My Lady, the First Minister on behalf of the entire Welsh Government shares your commitment to putting the bereaved, those who have suffered hardship and those who were affected by the decisions of the Governments of the UK at the heart of this Inquiry. The Welsh Government will make good that commitment by fully co-operating with this investigation.

Our overriding aim is to assist you in your task of ensuring that those, in particular, who lost their loved ones have all their questions asked and receive the complete and candid answers we acknowledge they rightly deserve.

The Welsh Government is committed to learning not only the lessons of this continuing pandemic but also to ensure that future Welsh governments are in the best position to respond to future public health challenges.

My Lady, diolch, thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed. Ms Spearing?
