3. Submissions on Behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Lavery
====================================================================================================

**Mr Lavery**: Good afternoon, my Lady. I hope you can hear me.

**Lady Hallett**: I can. I see you on the gallery view, thank you.

**Mr Lavery**: My Lady, as you know and as I've pointed out before, I represent the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, and indeed they are gathered today in Belfast to follow today's events. Their organisation is an important support mechanism for them through this complex legal process, but also a very difficult emotional process for the bereaved families to follow this, and it has to be explained to them by us exactly what is happening at each step of the way.

They will welcome, my Lady, your robust approach towards the forthcoming hearing date, and it is their desire that the hearings should be taking place expeditiously and as quickly as possible. But it's only right as well, my Lady, that we take this opportunity to highlight difficulties that we're facing and that the process has not been straightforward so far, and from the perspective of the Northern Ireland families, indeed all of the bereaved families, that we have concerns about the rate of disclosure and the provision of witness statements. We see this as being a very tight process to be able to manage within such a short period of time.

In particular in relation to the extent of disclosure from Northern Ireland, and indeed all of the devolved jurisdictions, there is so far unfortunately a dearth of information, firstly as to what the Inquiry have, secondly as to what might be coming, and we say that in the context of the absence of Rule 9 requests and indeed what is needed.

There are five witness statements that have been made available, but the only one that relates to Northern Ireland that has been made available is the one that in fact our families provided to the Inquiry.

So I say that not to criticise, my Lady, but to give your Ladyship an idea of the scale of the task that we face in those circumstances and what we might face as a difficulty. And your Ladyship will understand that this hinders our ability to assist the Inquiry team and take part in the process in as meaningful and substantive a way as we would like, and indeed we hope that your Ladyship would like, and the Inquiry team.

So these submissions are, to some extent, a request for more inclusion. We adopt the submissions of Mr Weatherby. By inclusion I mean the Rule 9 requests, and I reiterate that, and indeed some input -- more input in relation to experts. I'll deal with that in the Northern Ireland context in a second. I won't be speaking long this afternoon, my Lady.

But at the moment we currently face the prospect of being given material even after the Inquiry starts, and this is going to obviously present difficulties in terms of our input, our preparedness, and indeed, my Lady, what we can explain to our families as to what is happening and the context of all of that.

There may be material that emerges then in the course of evidence which unfortunately may lead to a greater number of requests to ask questions in a follow-up way under Rule 10. I welcome what Mr Keith said earlier, that there will be that opportunity to make such a request at the conclusion of evidence, but my concern is that we may be faced with more requests because of a lack of preparedness, in terms of rushing this module. I do not and my families do not want to have the date moved, my Lady.

We want expedition, but of course not at the expense of excellence or parts of the truth, and we appreciate that the task of the Inquiry, your Ladyship's task and the task of the Inquiry team, is enormous. So the observations made by ourselves and Mr Weatherby should be seen in that context, and that we're here to assist and ensure the Inquiry is as thorough and comprehensive and forensic as possible.

But in terms of witness statements, my Lady, our calculations -- a rough calculation is that we have received about 12% of the overall statements of evidence. We have carried out an audit of the material that we have received by way of disclosure, and we will be writing to the team in detail identifying parts that we feel have been omitted, including reference to organisations and even body heads, which we're not sure whether or not they have been included and to what extent they feel that their evidence may be relevant. This is not the forum, my Lady, to go into that in detail, and we will correspond with the Inquiry team about that.

Now, in relation to the expert evidence, we share the view with the other devolved jurisdictions that the expert evidence is then, in terms of dealing with the preparedness of the devolved jurisdictions and indeed Northern Ireland, and we welcome the acknowledgement of Mr Keith today of that fact and that the team have asked two of the experts to go back and prepare something on Northern Ireland and the devolved nations in particular.

There are matters that are cropping up in disclosure, my Lady, that we see as necessary in terms of dealing with Northern Ireland that do require, we say, specific input, analysis and comment from an expert that relate to Northern Ireland. This is in addition to what we have highlighted on previous occasions, the unique features of Northern Ireland, the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the single epidemiological unit that is the island of Ireland, and how the Northern Ireland institutions and indeed there are cross-border bodies, how they dealt with preparedness.

Secondly, my Lady, the impact of not just no government but one might describe it as dysfunctional government on preparedness. And then of course the unique Northern Irish system of healthcare. And, again, it gives me no pleasure to describe it in this way, but the failed and indeed broken state of the Northern Ireland healthcare service, even in comparison to other parts of the UK, my Lady, and I have given statistics on that on previous occasions.

One feature which is beginning to emerge as well, which we haven't looked at before, is the impact on the Northern Ireland civil service of Brexit preparations and how that impacted on the ability of the civil service to deal in a normal way with preparedness for a pandemic. Of course, around this time there was the unique impact that the threat of a no-deal Brexit was going to have on Northern Ireland in particular. So that is an issue which has emerged.

These are all issues we say that, yes, it's welcome that these two experts are going to be asked to look at Northern Ireland in particular. But we had named an individual who has specific Irish -- Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland -- expertise and who we regarded as extremely competent and perfectly placed to deal with Northern Ireland devolved issues.

We assume from the response today that that is not going to be looked at in the context of Module 1. Indeed, it would be impossible to see how somebody could be instructed in such a short timescale. But we do feel, my Lady, that in terms of modules going forward that there is a place for a Northern Irish expert to comment on the very unique characteristics that we continue to explain to your Ladyship and to the Tribunal. But that's not going to happen several weeks before the hearing date.

So really, I just want to reiterate again that we understand the mammoth task that is before your Ladyship and the Inquiry team, and that we are dealing with as well, and the purpose of our involvement in the Inquiry and in these preliminary hearings is to influence and contribute to this process, and these submissions hopefully will be seen just exactly in that context, and nothing more than that.

We feel that this is the essence of the role of a core participant, to influence and contribute, to assist, and indeed my clients do feel that they have, even so far, contributed in small ways to the direction of the Inquiry and hope to do this even further in due course.

We particularly welcome the inclusion of the witness statement from our group and the Northern Ireland bereaved families, and we feel that this, along with the other matters, should reflect the very key role that the bereaved families as core participants should play in this process, my Lady.

So those are my submissions this afternoon on behalf of those families that I represent who, as I say, are listening together in a room in Belfast, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Lavery. I'm very grateful for your assistance.

I know you'll work with the Inquiry team to ensure that the issues you've raised are properly addressed. We do all share the same aims, as you say, and I know that your approach will remain constructive. As for disclosure, as I said to Mr Weatherby King's Counsel, I do understand the concerns, and I promise you we'll do our very best to ensure that you get the information you need in sufficient time to prepare properly. I don't want to go down this path, but as Mr Keith mentioned earlier today, in exceptional circumstances I do have powers to ensure that people have been questioned appropriately and thoroughly. I can recall witnesses. I can ask people for further written submissions. So I hope that between us we can find ways to ensure that we're all ready to start these hearings on June 13, because I know that you understand why I'm so keen to get on. So thank you very much for your submissions, and I now need to ask whether it's best to break? Yes. I'm told it is best to break.

So thank you, Mr Lavery, and please send my best wishes to those who are gathered there with you. As you know, I always remember the time when I visited Belfast. Who could forget it? It was extraordinarily moving. And I shall be visiting Belfast again during the course of the Inquiry, I hope more than once.

**Mr Lavery**: I will, my Lady. Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Two o'clock, please.

*(12.57 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Good afternoon, everyone.

I think next it's time to call on Ms Mitchell King's Counsel. Ms Mitchell.
