2. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Weatherby
==================================================================================

**Mr Weatherby**: Thank you, and almost good afternoon.

Can I start by reiterating that the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK campaigned for a very long time for this Inquiry to be established, and it has no interest other than in assisting the Inquiry to work.

In so doing, the families wish to be allowed to effectively engage with the process and take as full a part as possible themselves and through their representatives, and that's what underpins these submissions and all others that I make.

We thank Mr Keith for his explanations this morning, much of which was new to us, and I will endeavour to tailor my submissions accordingly.

I must say at the outset, despite the upbeat way in which Mr Keith has put the preparations, that we do have some significant concerns about the progress towards the start of Module 1 on 13 June. So I'll adopt the same headings that Mr Keith has gone through this morning, so I'll start with the list of issues.

We welcome a number of the amendments that were made following the submissions from ourselves and other core participants. As you've heard, we raised three further points in our written submissions at paragraph 2. We noted the amendment to expressly include consideration of structural racism within Module 1, and we raised the point -- as you have been told this morning already -- that the Inquiry, being in the process of instructing an expert to address structural racism in Module 2, that we had asked that that report should cover Module 1.

Again, a reminder has been made that you indicated in your ruling that you would consider the issue with respect to other modules, and we're asking you to do that here with respect to Module 1, not least because of the amendment that you've made to the scope.

First of all, because that seems to be logical, and we have always struggled to see how the issues of structural racism could be considered in Module 2 without the expert considering how it affected preparedness.

We hear what Mr Keith says regarding professors Marmot and Bambra and dealing with these issues in Module 1, but for the stated reasons, having decided to instruct dedicated experts on this issue, we urge you to consider that they would be the best experts to deal with these matters with respect to Module 1 as well.

The second point, a short point, is that we did raise a number of issues in our submissions on the scope. Some of them were dealt with; some of them weren't. We suspect, as Mr Keith seems to have confirmed this morning, that many of them were considered within scope. We will take that up, if we may, with your team just to confirm whether in fact any of them were considered out of scope. It would helpful to know.

The third point is a more substantial one about the ambit of public health preparedness and whether it will cover preparedness of the health and social care sectors, so in short order, hospitals and care home emergency planning and preparedness. We think it is vital that they are included in Module 1 at a high level, not least because we know they're not covered, properly not covered, in our submission, in the provisional scope of Module 3. So if they're not covered in Module 1, where would they be covered?

We had some discussions yesterday between counsel, and we thought in fact that the health and social care preparedness was going to be included at a high level within Module 1, to include hospitals and care homes at a high level rather than an operational level. But we're less sure this morning, from what has been said.

We fully understand that Module 1 shouldn't delve into individual facilities, but we do think that it should cover the overall preparedness of the NHS and the healthcare systems within each of the devolved nations and jurisdiction, and also the position within the social care sectors, particularly but not exclusively with respect to care homes.

So just by way of a couple of examples, we would say that Module 1 should deal with things like the planning and preparedness of bed capacity in the event of a pandemic within the healthcare systems, and it should consider things such as the planning and preparedness for discharges and transfers between hospitals and the social care sector and things like that, where -- albeit we're cognisant of the fact it shouldn't go into individual hospitals or care homes or specific facilities -- but if not here, where will that be dealt with, is the way we would put it.

Lastly, in respect of scope, Mr Keith again has referred to the devolved nations and jurisdiction, and we note the expanded reference within the list of issues. However, as we'll come on to -- and again Mr Keith has touched on -- this welcome expansion in the language of the list of issues is welcome, but it isn't currently matched by the extent of the disclosure relating to the devolved preparedness, and we think that that is a significant problem. Now, Mr Keith has indicated this morning that we're imminently to receive a large amount of such disclosure, and we hope that comes to reality.

With respect to this topic, given the amount of ground I'm going to cover, I'm going to defer to Mr Lavery, and I think Ms Heaven also is going to follow in on aspects to do with Northern Ireland and Wales with these in mind.

We also do raise the issues about expert assistance with respect to the devolved issues on Module 1. We do welcome the instruction of Dr Kirchelle, which may assist with the concerns to some degree, but again I'll leave it to others to add flesh to those bones.

In respect of Rule 9s and witness statements, I'm really going to concentrate on the witness statements rather than the Rule 9s. At paragraph 6 of our written submissions, we noted that by the date of that submission, last Wednesday, 19 April, we'd received only four witness statements relating to the witnesses who are on the Inquiry provisional Module 1 witness list. So it's all very helpful Mr Keith has gone through the wider picture of how many witness statements are extant and where we're up to with them, but to us, the concentration ought to be on the fact that we have received such a small number of witness statements from the list of witnesses who the Inquiry team currently intends to call in only a few weeks' time.

I note that since last Wednesday, we have had one further statement, so currently we have five out of, I think, 58 non-expert witnesses provisionally expected to be called, and that list also refers to the fact that the list will get longer. At item 25 of the list, it refers to an unknown number of individual scientists who will be added, and again it doesn't include witnesses that we may suggest or have suggested or indeed other CPs have suggested. So the position is, in our submission, quite significant.

Also, although we have had these five witness statements, there are a number of key figures, for example Mr Hunt or Mr Cameron, who are on the witness list, so they are very important witness statements that are awaited, and that gives us cause for concern.

We note that the CTI note on 6 April at paragraph 17 said that the Inquiry anticipated receiving and disclosing more statements over the course of that week, and that at 17(b) it indicated sensibly that the Inquiry team would prioritise disclosure of the witnesses on the provisional list. Here we are three weeks later, and only one more has been disclosed from those that are on that list.

So it's not the absolute position that concerns us, not only that, but it's the fact that the expectations of CTI, with respect to progress on that front, do not seem to have been realised, at least within that timeframe.

The next point is that in the note, and it's at paragraph 4 to 8 of the CTI note, that it's stated that:

"Perhaps a substantial number of the witnesses on the provisional list will be receiving further Rule 9s."

So (a) we haven't got most of the witness statements, and (b) there's still further requests going out to those witnesses. So that's, again, a factor of real concern to us, of the Inquiry being able to be properly ready by mid-June.

As Mr Keith mentioned, we're asked to comment on the witness list by Thursday. That's going to be very difficult when we have only a handful of the witness statements. We don't have the Rule 9s, as a fact, and therefore not only do we not have the statements but we don't know what is expected to be within the statements, which would have been a help in commenting on whether the ambit of the provisional witness list is wide enough or not.

Again, we did speak to Counsel to the Inquiry yesterday about this problem, and we note that they're sympathetic to our predicament in commenting on the list by Thursday, and we're grateful for that. But the timescale -- general timescale is of course incredibly tight, so the solution to this is quite difficult to see at the moment.

A further additional problem to that is that on the current timetable, we're to receive and start to respond to evidence proposals for those on that list from 15 and 22 May respectively. Translating that, it is 12 and 17 working days away, respectively, and that is a very short period of time when, again, we don't have the statements or indeed some of the documentation. So we're to respond within two days to the list, we're then to respond within 17 working days to evidence proposals, and we don't have the statements of most of those witnesses, and indeed we don't have a timetable either.

Turning to the issue of the content of the corporate and other witness statements themselves, we again note Mr Keith's reassurances this morning, and indeed we had similar reassurances yesterday in the conversation that I had with him. From the CTI note, it appears that multiple central government departments have failed to respond adequately to the requests made. At paragraph 6 of the note, referring directly to the central government departments, CTI said:

"A considerable number of the statements contained insufficient detail and posed more questions than they answered. The Inquiry considers that it should have been clear to those organisations that the statements simply would not provide the Chair with the detail that she will require in order to consider their responsibility for and involvement in the matters set out in the Inquiry's provisional outline of scope or its Rule 9 requests."

Of course, we read that with considerable concern. In our submissions about position statements back in September, we noted -- and again I quote that:

"Position statements ensure a comprehensive account provided openly and at an early stage and avoid the issue that can otherwise arise in which organisations remain silent on matters until they are asked, creating delay and an appearance of evasion which assists neither the Inquiry, CPs nor the wider public."

Unfortunately, that submission appears to have proved prescient. Let me make the point clear, as I hope we did in our written submissions. When you consider position statements, you describe the aim as laudable but considered there was a better way of achieving the same thing. At least from CTI's note, it appears that that other way has been frustrated.

The note, as I've read, asserts that the deficits in those statements should have been obvious to those organisations. I'd add to that that central government officials answer such requests through their lawyers, and therefore there really is no excuse for any failures to address matters.

We don't have the Rule 9s, we don't have more than a handful of the completed statements, so it's not clear to us in what way the central government departments have failed to properly respond, other than that account given in the note. We are given today some reassurance and a different emphasis, if I can put it that way, on the problem. But we haven't in fact seen any fruits of those assurances, and we fear that there will be a dragging of heels by certain of the material providers, and that may be a continuing feature of the whole Inquiry unless this matter is brought out into the open.

The words used in the CTI note indicate this as being a widespread problem, not one confined to one or two statements, and, as I've said, the note pulls no punches in asserting that the problem should have been clear to the departments and, of course, their lawyers.

The fact we've received such a small number of statements indicates the problems that this has caused or exacerbated. The note was forthright in its criticism of, effectively, the lack of co-operation, and it generated the need for more requests. Although it's welcome that CTI reports progress has been made, the proof will be when we see the statements, which of course we haven't yet.

So we submit that the Inquiry should consider three things: that where it is apparent that there has been a failure to comply and thereby either caused -- or, in fact, caused significant problems for the Inquiry, those departments or organisations should be asked to account for that, and those explanations should be disclosed.

Secondly, there should be open and transparent directions setting out what was originally requested of them and what has now had to be further requested and the deadlines set.

Thirdly, as we've said in writing, and Mr Keith turned to earlier, there should be further consideration of whether requiring position statements, even now, might be a way forward, a process which we've indicated we're more than happy to assist with. We say "further consideration" because we don't know what was and wasn't included in the requests to the departments or the deficits within what they did in fact reply. So we're not, certainly not, asking for any repetition -- they may not be necessary. But a critical issue to us is whether the organisations were asked to proactively address what they acknowledge went wrong or should have been done differently or better in terms of their planning and preparedness, and what they say are the lessons already learned. The answer to those inquiries has the potential to help the Inquiry really cut to the core of the issues rather than to end up searching for needles in the large number of documents that are the haystacks that have been provided to the Inquiry.

We've seen little evidence that those questions have in fact been asked from the statements, or indeed answered, save perhaps in one statement which purports to address lessons learned.

In terms of disclosure more generally, I'll deal with this shortly, having dealt with the witness statements or the lack of witness statements, we've noted that there is a substantial amount of disclosure remaining to be made, and Mr Keith has helpfully outlined how much there really is.

We note what CTI has said about the considerable amount of material being produced to the Inquiry without proper reference to the requests or the scope of Module 1, and in the written note there is reference to much of it being too "granular".

We entirely understand the concept. It doesn't assist the Inquiry or anybody else to just produce large quantities of material and dump it, effectively, on the Inquiry. Providers have to be responsible for determining in the first place what is potentially relevant. However, they can only do so if they have proper guidance and they're clear what are the criteria. How is the material provided to determine what is too granular, and only through clear guidance and criteria set by the Inquiry team. Is there such guidance and criteria, and if so, can it be disclosed? What's the process for checking that a consistent approach is being applied across the piece? And how can the Inquiry be clear that a consistent approach is being applied across departments? Disclosure of these matters is important not only for the Inquiry but also for core participants to be reassured that proper disclosure is being made and supervised by the Inquiry.

The fact that the Inquiry has such a massive task, has core participants coming from different directions, makes it very difficult for the Inquiry to ensure that proper disclosure is being made to it, and it's only really by publishing the criteria for that which will make that process happen.

In terms of the Rule 10 process, or the questioning of witnesses process, again this morning Mr Keith has given considerable further information about the approach, which is very welcome indeed. We dealt with this in our written submissions between paragraphs 31 and 38. We've put forward a tried and tested process used at the Manchester Arena Inquiry, similar to some other Inquiries of which we have experience. Broadly, that's the process that CTI puts forward as the first part of its proposed process at paragraphs 28 and 9 of the CTI note but undertaken in a shorter time period, over about 14 days prior to the witness actually giving evidence.

The solicitors to the Inquiry are familiar with that process, as they were also STI on the Arena Inquiry, and that process is straightforward. The Inquiry team provide the proposals, core participants respond, the Inquiry team review those responses, decisions are made as to changes to the scope of evidence and the topics each witness will be asked about and who will ask the questions. Where there are unresolved points about additional topics core participants raise, those generally can be resolved through dialogue between counsel, and then obviously you, as Chair, have the final say. In our experience, the process generally works with little or no need to trouble the Chair, because it's iterative and it is a collaborative process.

The issue of who asks the questions has been raised, and the benefits of having more perspective than different voices have been made previously and repeated in summary in our written submissions. I don't take that further. But in our experience, this process leads to a situation where core participants may well not seek to ask questions of many witnesses, not least because Counsel to the Inquiry will cover all the points, but where core participants do seek to explore particular topics, a proportionate and efficient approach can be taken through this process.

We take -- we're happy with what's been said this morning by Mr Keith about that, and it appears that further consideration has been made, and there is the indication that there will be consideration given to core participants being able to take part in oral advocacy, and there can be discussions within this process. That's precisely what this process does include, as put forward by ourselves in those paragraphs which, as I say, does considerably overlap with the initial parts of the process.

I'm grateful to Mr Keith also for his comments about the additional process added at paragraphs 31 and following of his note, described as the pre-Rule 10 process, because that to us is quite problematic, and it's been explained that this additional stage is for us to persuade that more questions can be asked. We're not aware of other proceedings where this approach has been taken, and with the greatest of respect, we think there's a reason for that, because we don't think it will work.

The witness proposal, the response to it, the review of that, and the further dialogue necessary is straightforward and resolves issues, in our submission. Another round with a second series of documents which, at paragraph 32, CTI indicates would be a further template or spreadsheet, but which they expressly say should specify not just issues or topics but the specific questions that we would seek to ask -- that's paragraph 32(b). -- we say is just unworkable, that advocacy doesn't work like that. In fact, if it did, we wouldn't need oral questioning at all. One question leads to another or the end of a line of questioning. It's organic. And so where the further stage delves into that level of detail, we say that it is not helpful.

We also note that the objections that we would have to this pre-Rule 10 process are also very practical. We note that where it's operated before, the simpler process generally takes place over 14 days or thereabouts. This proposal would expand that something like four weeks. That would mean by the time that the first witness in Module 1 is called, on the approach as designed, with weekly witness proposals being disclosed from four weeks prior to the start date, there would be no less than five different weekly witness evidence proposals in process by the time the first witness is called. In our submission, that would be a recipe for chaos, and therefore we would urge the re-think. And, as I say, again, I'm pleased by the matter raised by Mr Keith about the reasonable discussions that can take place about other CPs taking part in the oral advocacy.

Can I finally turn to the issue of Every Story Matters and the witness evidence from the bereaved.

With respect to the Every Story Matters project, the commemorations and the proposed videos to be heard at the outset of each module, we've made various submissions. But in our current submissions at paragraphs 43 to 6, we really raise two key things: that firstly, a clear plan should be provided by the Inquiry as to how these projects are intended to work and to what end; and, secondly, that the position that has hitherto been extant that they are not part of the legal process should be dropped and there should be fuller dialogue and consultation with us as representatives of the bereaved about what the Inquiry is doing.

We have repeatedly made the first point, the need for a clear plan setting everything out, and we're very pleased to hear that the Inquiry has now seen that this is the right course to take, and that is a big step forward, with respect.

Confidence in the Every Story Matters project by the bereaved families I represent is very low indeed. It's therefore important that the plan that is set out is as comprehensive as it can be and, in our respectful submission, it should include how the material is to be gathered, who by, what expertise and training they are to have, how the process of the information gathered can be quality assured -- we note that anyone can complete the online form even multiple times -- and the product of it is to be anonymised.

We know, from the webinar transcript Mr Keith referred to, about the targeted qualitative research to be directed by the Inquiry team. We're grateful for his further explanation about that, but it would be helpful to have that fully set out in the plan: the criteria set, again who will undertake it, and what is being sought.

We note also the ethics panel and the terms of reference regarding this targeted research. Again, we would like to understand that in greater detail, and it would have been helpful to have had dialogue about it before it was set up. So, as I say, we think it's a considerable step forward that the Inquiry is going to provide this plan.

Once the information is gathered, the next part that we hope the plan will address is: what is to happen to it? How is it to be analysed and by whom? What experience and training will they have? What's the object of the analysis? We're told there is to be a series of research reports which will be adduced in evidence in each module. The webinar transcript confirmed that Ipsos would be doing the analysis. Perhaps that may not be fixed in stone, given what was said about the contracts. But what experience and expertise and training does Ipsos, or whoever does it -- what do they have in that regard? It's very important, and very important in terms of messaging to the bereaved but no doubt others as well, that this is not treated as some kind of market research and that the people who are doing it have training or expertise in dealing with the bereaved.

The transcript indicates that the reports should answer the key questions in each of the modules, that they will after a few months be reviewed as to whether there are further areas we, the Inquiry, need to explore.

The Inquiry is outsourcing the gathering of the evidence relevant to terms of reference in this sense, and having it presented in an anonymised way, and then considered in evidence. Apart from knowing who the analysts will be generically and their skillsets, we would also wish to understand who it is proposed will be the authors of these reports and how will the Inquiry be able to assess them, assess their weight, assess the reliability of the information within them. All of this is highly sensitive to the bereaved because, as we understand it, this will be an important part of their evidence.

The second point is perhaps more obvious, or just as obvious, and that's engagement with us. We don't dispute the fact that the Inquiry team or parts of it have engaged with some of the bereaved, including the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, and that's to be applauded. But we have been told from the outset that this isn't part of the legal process. We, as the representatives of the bereaved, have been told that, in terms, express terms, that it's not within the tasks that we are permitted to undertake, and that, with the greatest of respect, has created some problems. And we particularly think and submit that it's important that the Inquiry has dialogue over all of these matters with us as the representatives of the bereaved, and not in any way diminishing the importance of engaging with the bereaved directly themselves.

In terms of the other matters, in terms of commemorations and the videos, whereas we welcome the fact that the Inquiry is looking at commemorations and looking at the experiences of the bereaved and others in respect of the pandemic, we do remain of the view that the Inquiry should keep under consideration hearing directly from a proportional number of the bereaved in both of those regards. We understand the videos, for example, are going to be approximately 15 minutes, and we say that that is not an adequate way of presenting the effect of the pandemic on the bereaved, never mind others.

In terms of witness evidence, having looked at the Every Story Matters plan and engagement, I just want to address in short detail what we submit that the Inquiry should do in terms of direct evidence from family members going to the terms of reference.

It is entirely right what Mr Keith says, that you have previously indicated that you will take evidence from individuals where it sheds light on systemic failures. We've taken account of that. That was made clear to us in a follow-up letter from STI dated 8 December, and that's why we have advanced this spreadsheet of a proportionate number of bereaved family members whom we say should be considered in Module 1 -- as Mr Keith says, there are about 20 of them -- and we currently intend to take a similar approach in other modules, and we've invited dialogue about that approach with your team.

We're entirely on the same page as the Inquiry, as the need for evidence in each module to be sufficient but proportionate. We've made clear from the outset that we entirely, with respect, agree that the Inquiry must move as swiftly as possible but without cutting any corners.

In terms of the dialogue about witnesses, it seemed to us that the discussion is best undertaken in the light of the Inquiry's list of provisional witnesses for Module 1. However, in light of the comments made by Mr Keith a little earlier, I will just take another minute or two just to address some of those.

We've expressly on this spreadsheet put forward a proportionate number of family members with regard to preparedness. We're not asking the Inquiry to investigate the circumstances of the individual deaths of the loved ones of those bereaved persons.

I'll give but one very short anonymised example. One of the witnesses we've put forward is a frontline doctor. She was at the frontline dealing with Covid. She also has relevant other experience in the army. She has evidence, illustrative evidence, of the lack of preparedness which we say should be heard. It should be heard because it's important to Module 1 and to the Inquiry, but it's also important in engaging family members in the evidence itself and having them valued before the processes, the evidential processes of the Inquiry, whatever other processes, for example, of Every Story Matters, are.

I think those are my submissions, and thank you for listening.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Weatherby.

I appreciate your concern about disclosure and people being ready by June 13, but I must say that I am determined to start this Inquiry on 13 June for reasons I've set out before because it is absolutely essential if I am to make timely recommendations, and by that I mean recommendations if not this year, certainly next year, that we get on with hearing evidence. So I will take a lot of persuading to postpone the start date. So I'm afraid everybody, including the Inquiry team, have to be aware of that fact, as I think they are.

As far as the additional informal process before Rule 10 is concerned, it is intended to assist core participants to participate effectively in the Inquiry process, not hinder. In fact, I believe that the first suggestion aired in public came from Ms Mitchell on behalf of the Scottish Bereaved. I understood at that time that it was welcomed. If that is not the case, then please remember, Mr Weatherby, that it is optional, and you only have to comply or engage in the informal process if you think it would be helpful to your representation of Bereaved Families for Justice United Kingdom.

As far as the Listening Exercise is concerned, I have listened to complaints that have been made in the past about the difficulty in obtaining the information you require, although I have to say when I made enquiries I discovered a very considerable amount of information available, but I do accept that it could be in one place, made even -- given even more detail, to help those whom you represent understand what is happening.

A number of bereaved groups are co-operating with the Listening Exercise because they understand that this is our way of trying to ensure that people's voices are heard.

I'm not sure what you mean about being informed the Listening Exercise is not part of the legal process, because I have always intended that my deliberations and my gathering of information and my conclusions and recommendations will be based in part on evidence I hear directly from witnesses during the course of the public hearings, and in part on the information gathered during the Listening Exercise.

So there are a number of ways in which people whom you represent, for example, can contribute to the Inquiry. There will be some who may well be called to deal with systemic failings. There will be some who may be called in later modules to deal with the impact upon them. There will be some who contribute by agreeing to be interviewed and filmed, and the videos will be played at each of the module hearings, and there will be some who will share their experiences with the Inquiry at community events, online, in person, on the telephone.

I'd just ask, Mr Weatherby, before you advance this kind of criticism of the Listening Exercise, for fear -- I know you don't intend this -- but for fear of putting people off engaging, that people do check their facts and see whether or not there is the detail there that people need to understand the exercise.

I will need the engagement of members of the public in the United Kingdom if I am going to be able to produce conclusions and recommendations that, if implemented, could reduce the suffering of the kind that those whom you represent have already suffered for other people in the future. So I need as much assistance as possible, and I welcome your continued assertions that that co-operation will be forthcoming from the organisation that you represent.

Thank you very much, Mr Weatherby.

Mr Lavery.
