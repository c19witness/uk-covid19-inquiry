8. Professor Anthony Costello
=============================

*PROFESSOR ANTHONY COSTELLO (continued).*

Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry (continued)

**Mr Keith**: Professor Costello, you remain under oath.

We were talking before lunch about basic infection control measures, and your evidence was to this effect, if I may summarise it without injustice: that a core infection control measure is testing alongside trace, contact, isolation, for the purposes of, firstly, understanding the spread of the virus, secondly, breaking chains of transmission.

At what point can a government be expected to conclude that such basic infection control measures are required? Is it when an epidemic spreads from another country, becoming therefore a pandemic once it approaches a number of other countries? Is it when infection breaches our own borders and is traced by way of such limited testing as there was of travellers as they enter the United Kingdom? Or is it when the science makes it clear, both from an understanding of the infection fatality rate -- which enables you to know what you're dealing with, how many cases there are, by comparison to how many will die -- and the degree of asymptomatic transmission? When -- or perhaps a mixture. When should a government, should this government have said, "We must now take infection control measures"?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, you need to prepare for it from the very beginning, when there is the first indication that things are serious. And I would argue from the evidence of others that by the third week of January, when people were dying in the streets in China, when three papers were published in The Lancet detailing human-to-human transmission, and Jeremy Farrar was saying that by 24 January it was clear this was very serious, that John Edmunds and Graham Medley both gave an interview to Reuters in which they said they knew this was very serious by that time, so the preparation would therefore need to be made for any virus for which test, trace, isolate and support could reasonably be expected to control the virus.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there. Thank you.

We have a chronology, Professor, and --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- I would just like to take you through some of the more significant dates in January and February. INQ000303290. On the chronology, we can see on 9 January the World Health Organisation issued a statement regarding the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan in China.

On 13 January, over the page, please, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand reported the first case outside of China.

On 20 January, the World Health Organisation reported 282 infections, four of which were outside China, and six deaths.

The following day, on 21 January, the World Health Organisation published its first Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) report.

What was the significance of that 21 January World Health Organisation report? Did it say anything about the extent of human-to-human transmission, therefore the likelihood of humans infecting other humans?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, WHO had been handicapped because the director of WHO in China, Dr Gauden Galea had not been allowed access to Wuhan, despite repeated requests, so this was a report which just said that the evidence now emerging was that human-to-human transmission was happening, in which case the threat of a substantial pandemic would be likely.

**Lead Inquiry**: On 22 January, in the United Kingdom, the Public Health England UK risk level was raised from very low to low. I'm not going to ask you about the meaning of that --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- it's a term of art on which we will hear evidence from others.

That 22 January was, in fact, the first time that SAGE sat, it sat on a precautionary basis, that is to say it had not been formally convened --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- but it came together on a precautionary basis without formal activation by COBR. The minutes record, if you take it from me, please, Professor, at point 7:

"There is evidence of person-to-person transmission. It is unknown whether transmission is sustainable. There is no evidence yet on whether individuals are infectious prior to showing symptoms."

So by this week in January, do you believe that it was clear that the virus in China would spread outside China, would eventually reach all countries? In which case, what degree of understanding --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- of the nature of the virus was apparent?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, it was changing very fast at that time. And you're quoting the 22nd, which was the day after China had, for the first time, admitted the scale of deaths in Wuhan. For the previous five days they'd been saying there were none. And so it was a fast-moving situation, but certainly by the 24th, if you go on, it was becoming clear that there was human-to-human transmission. And there were three reports in The Lancet which referred to this which were published based on data that had been collected in the first three weeks of January.

**Lead Inquiry**: That data published, as you rightly say -- I think there was an article in The Lancet. There was also another article in the Journal, the New Journal of Medicine, showed that in relation to particular clusters of infections in China, there was sustained human-to-human transmission between close family members.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: So should one have taken from that that transmission between humans generally was now established? If it was happening between close family members, it was likely to happen between members of the public?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: I think so, but it would also indicate that you have an even better chance of closing it down if your supposition was not correct, that, you know, the most important thing is to close down an infection from close family members, and therefore that makes it easier if you can close down households. And that's the first principle.

Remember that in the early days you don't have tests, so what you go on are symptoms and :outline:`close contacts`, and if you can close that down then you hope that you can bring about containment.

**Lead Inquiry**: Of course --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: And suppression actually.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- at this point, on 22/23 January, there had yet been no cases in the United Kingdom at all?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No, correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

Around that same time, Imperial College issued what was then known as its third report, which estimated that the basic reproduction number, R, was above 1, meaning every single person would be likely to infect more than one other person in an unimmunised population, which indicated self-sustaining human-to-human transmission, and they stated that that implied that control measures were needed to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak, because the likelihood was that one person would infect between two to three people, in fact, and therefore, with that level of increase, a corresponding amount of pressure would have to be applied to keep the outbreak under control.

By that week, so the week of 24/25 January, do you believe that the United Kingdom Government should have been taking active steps to prepare for the inevitable arrival of the virus here?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, I certainly think all the alarm bells were running -- were flashing, and therefore having a meeting, which they then went on to have on the 28th, would have said: look, we know this is a coronavirus, what are WHO saying? What's happening in the East Asian states? And should we be setting up advisory groups to deal with how we get a national test, how we can set up community mobilisation for contact tracing? And what should be our quarantine and isolation policies?

Those are the kinds of things. And obviously if this is growing -- you know, between the 24th and the 28th things started to happen, and in fact that was the time, on the 27th, when I sent a message to Dr Peter Singer at WHO, who was one of Dr Tedros's advisers.

As you know, on 23 January, the PHEIC committee, the public health emergency of international concern committee, at WHO met. That's not an internal committee, it's an external -- you're going to come on to that.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there, just to make plain, when you say "PHEIC", you mean P-H-E-I-C, the acronym, not "fake", F-A-K-E.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No, that's right, I beg your pardon.

**Lead Inquiry**: Professor Woolhouse was telling the Inquiry earlier that one of the major problems when facing an emerging outbreak, an emerging epidemic, is knowing whether or not the number of cases in which people are seriously ill or will die is reflective of the whole scale of the outbreak?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: So they may be a very small proportion of people who are infected, or they could be a very large proportion of people who are infected?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: At this stage, the UK Government couldn't and didn't know whether or not people who were dying in China were a large proportion of the people who were infected or a small proportion?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: That was a vital issue, was it not, because without knowing the answer to that question they wouldn't know how big the outbreak is, how widely the virus spreads, and how great the transmission is?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Except by the 27th we knew that it had spread to 17 countries.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: We knew that it was, therefore, spreading quite quickly. We also knew from the studies in The Lancet and from anecdotal reports that the case fatality rate of people in hospital was worryingly high --

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: -- 5%, yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there, because you've raised something that we need to explore. The case fatality rate, as it suggests, is the number of people who die amongst the number of confirmed cases --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- hence case fatality rate?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: That's not the same, is it, as the number of people who die amongst everybody who has been infected?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: That is the infection fatality rate?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: But at this stage, no one knew what the infection fatality rate was, did they?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No, they didn't, but one knew that, being a coronavirus that the SARS had had an infection fatality rate of 15%, SARS-1. MERS was 30%. So the likelihood was that this was going to be significantly more serious than seasonal flu.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: So, on the precautionary principle, you would have to say: yes, we think the infection fatality rate is going to be lower than the case fatality rate -- and I thought Chris Whitty got this about right, he thought he would bring it down to 1%. And that was something that -- I shared the same view. But even at 1%, if you've got a respiratory virus that spreads around a country and infects 60% of the population, 1% is a lot of deaths.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there.

You've introduced the notion, the subject of the precautionary principle. Is that a term of art or a shorthand for saying you may not know what the precise nature of this outbreak is, you may not know its latent period for sure, how long it takes for someone to be able to infect somebody else, how often it doubles, what its infection fatality rate is, but if you believe that that virus is coming your way, you must act early in a precautionary way to cover the eventuality that it breaks through. Is that the nub of it?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah. And I think that, on the 28th, when they met for the second meeting, that's the kind of thing they should have been talking about: who are the coronavirus experts? What are the plans we should be making? And -- rather than taking a very final decision about this is pandemic flu.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there. So could we have INQ000057492, please, which are the minutes from this -- it was the second stage, wasn't it, Professor --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- on 28 January.

Just to get out bearings, we can see this is the -- well, it's called the "Addendum to the second SAGE meeting":

"This addendum clarifies the roles of the SAGE attendees ..."

There are then the attendees listed.

My Lady, the names of the junior officials and the secretariat are redacted under the ordinary principles.

If you could go, then, please, over the page.

Paragraph 1:

"[Department of Health and Social Care] to send PHE isolation plan to behavioural scientists (see further action below)."

If you could scroll back out, please, 8:

"Diagnostics: Specific test should be ready by the end of week, with capacity to run 400 to 500 tests per day. Guidance being rolled out to laboratories in the UK. Sensitivity of test unclear, particularly in early phases of illness or when symptoms are mild. Currently it would not be useful to test asymptomatic individuals, as a negative test result could not be interpreted with certainty."

So was the position on the 28th, then, Professor, that the participants in this meeting understood that testing was absolutely required but there were two limitations: one, what in practice was available, not much by way of capacity; and two, whatever testing there was would throw up false negative and positive results?

Dealing with those two points in reverse order, do you have to wait until you've got a test that works really well before you start deploying it?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No, not -- no test is perfect, and most tests will either be, either -- you know, create false positives or they may create false negatives.

**Lead Inquiry**: That is to say, a false positive telling you that you've got the virus when you haven't --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- or falsely telling you're clear when you've got it?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Which is worse, of course, the false negative. So you want a screening or a test that will pick up all potential cases or as many as possible.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there.

The capacity to run 400 to 500 tests per day, at this stage in the process, Public Health England, the government, was testing some people who were arriving, because there were tests done on travellers, as well as testing of index cases. That is to say, persons who have got the infection and they're being tested, as are their contacts, to try to identify the first few hundred cases; is that correct?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: Would a capacity of 400 to 500 tests per day suffice in the event that the virus spreads, known or unknown, and reaches thousands or more?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No. But can I just point out that this refers to the capacity of PHE. Public Health England is a misnomer. Public Health England does not cover most of the public health services of England. The -- in 2013, when the Lansley reforms came in, all the districts, 309 districts in England, their public health was moved from NHS control to local authority control. So all of the district public health teams were under local authority control. Public Health England was a little bit like a sort of government thinktank of experts with a limited number of laboratories, I think they had eight laboratories. But around the country we had 44 molecular biological laboratories for virology testing, which was completely outside of the Public Health England control.

So when we're talking about the 400 or 500, that's what they would have managed. And later it was argued if they could only manage that there was no point in us developing it.

And I should point out that South Korea --

**Lead Inquiry**: I'm sorry, Professor, there is a method to my madness. We will be coming on to these issues. But the way in which you answer makes it difficult for us to follow and for the stenographer to record, so please try to restrain your answer.

So this is a reference, then, to PHE testing?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: We'll come back to the question of whether there were other testing facilities available of which PHE failed to avail itself. That's a separate issue.

Could we look, please, at paragraph 19:

"Control measures: ideally infection control in healthcare settings and rapid detection of cases."

20:

"It was agreed that Pandemic Influenza infection control guidance should be used as a base case and adapted."

What do you understand that agreement to have amounted to?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, I --

**Lead Inquiry**: And shortly, please, Professor.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah. I've linked that to their decision to allow the virus to spread, and to come up with their strategy of contain, delay, research and mitigate rather than suppress. If you're following a pandemic influenza strategy, then you cannot control the virus.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there. There is a reference, a plain reference to "Pandemic Influenza infection control". Is that a throwback to the strategy that you referred to earlier, the 2011 pandemic flu strategy?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: There was a strategy for dealing with flu pandemics?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Under that control guidance, as you described earlier, there's little point having a test because people become infected and then show symptoms and infect others so quickly --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- there isn't a window in which to test?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: And the best control is to identify whether you have a symptom, and if you do, isolate.

Does it appear to you that there was any debate about the sort of control guidance that might be needed for a coronavirus as opposed to a pandemic influenza? That is to say, testing, whole-society isolation, stay at home orders, lockdowns.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No, not necessarily lockdowns. I mean --

**Lead Inquiry**: Well, that's for a later day, Professor.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just please focus on the question. Does this paragraph indicate to you that there was any debate on any of those other measures?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No, I can't say one way or another, because there's no mention of coronavirus control in the notes.

**Lead Inquiry**: No. But you describe the decision to draw upon pandemic influenza control guidance and vary it as being a fatal error. Why is it a fatal error, in your opinion?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Because if that's what they're assuming, that you cannot suppress this virus, then it completely releases the pressure on them to set up a group to look at scaling up a national testing system, a national contact tracing system and, very importantly, policies that would enable people to be quarantined and isolated and financially supported.

**Lead Inquiry**: Where does it say in paragraph 20 "we cannot suppress this new virus"?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: It's an implication from saying "Pandemic Influenza infection control".

**Lead Inquiry**: Is it?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lady Hallett**: Doesn't the "Action" suggest it as well?

"... SPI-M to advise on actions the UK could take to slow down the spread ..."

Not suppress it.

**Mr Keith**: Is slowing down the spread part of either mitigation or suppression or neither?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Suppression is where you control so that you get the R value below 1 and the number of cases will peter out, and then you put in place a system whereby if there are any outbreaks you can jump on them quickly.

But --

**Lead Inquiry**: By way of test, trace, contact, isolate?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: In paragraph 21, SAGE makes the point that there is:

"Currently no evidence of control measures having an impact on transmission rate, but [that that] is to be expected ..."

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Do you understand that is because no one, let alone in China, had produced the data which showed what the impact would have been or was of applying measures?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

At the bottom of the page, as my Lady has noted, there is an action. You describe this action as being a second fatal error, and the Inquiry understands that you do so because the action was directed at SPI-M.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: The modellers. What, in your opinion, was wrong about asking SPI-M, modelling scientists, to advise on, by implication, practical actions that the United Kingdom could take to slow down the spread of the outbreak?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, first they called it scientific pandemic influenza modelling.

**Lead Inquiry**: Would --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, no --

**Lead Inquiry**: Professor --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: -- this is important, because actually it should be SPC-M, It should be about coronavirus. So the wrong virus and the wrong strategy.

**Lead Inquiry**: Let us not get into a debate about the correctness of the terminology under which the group operates. What, in your view, was the fallacy or the error in having --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Right.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- SPI-M as a group of expert, well intentioned scientists, albeit modellers, advising on actions that the United Kingdom could take?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Because they were asked to model slowing down the spread, but they were not asked to model the impact of test, trace and isolate, and they did not do that. They basically looked at a whole number of other measures like school closures, like large events, like :outline:`face masks`, you know, whatever, all the various so-called NPIs, but they didn't model what all the East Asian states were doing and what WHO was recommending.

**Lead Inquiry**: Because those measures were measures more usually associated with flu pandemics and they were the measures which in fact were reflected in the 2011 strategy?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

To what extent do you understand that SAGE was calling here for practical steps to be taken to put boots on the ground, as you describe it, as opposed to modelling what might happen?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah, they seemed to be focusing mainly on modelling, and the absence of an independent UK public health expert on the committee meant that there was no one challenging this idea. To me, and particularly in light of what WHO were saying at the time, and later from the evidence in February from all the East Asian states, we needed to move fast to get a national test system, to mobilise contact tracing and to set up isolation procedures, and we weren't doing that, and we were therefore effectively allowing things to spread or to accept that we couldn't suppress it.

**Lead Inquiry**: In your statement, you say that:

"From January 28 the UK advisory die was cast. The UK medical and scientific group of experts saw it as a flu epidemic. In their view there was nothing the UK could do to stop it, only to manage its progress, [and ultimately, of course] to protect the NHS."

Is that the genesis, in your view, of the contain, delay strategy and also the strategy, as it became apparent in March, of mitigating, levelling the curve --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- suppressing the sombrero as opposed to trying to stop the virus in its tracks?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yes, I think so. And I think it's backed up by what Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty have said.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. That's a matter for my Lady, not, I think, for a witness.

The World Health Organisation then reported on 29 January, INQ000268222, at page 4.

The director general, Tedros Ghebreyesus, said:

"The continued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China are of course both deeply [disturbing]."

Had you contacted the WHO yourself in order to persuade them to declare a PHEIC sooner than it did on 30 January?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, after the decision on the 23rd, I was fairly certain that many of the internal people at WHO were keen to have declared a PHEIC straightaway.

Remember, WHO had been very severely criticised about the slowness of its response to Ebola in 2014/15, and I therefore sent a message to Tedros's -- he calls himself Dr Tedros, so it's -- to say: listen, it's spreading, 250,000 cases are predicted by the end of the week, it's in 17 countries, we therefore -- I strongly urge you to try and persuade the independent committee to get a PHEIC.

In fact Tedros was already on the plane to China to get a commitment from Xi Jinping to let them in, and in fact a PHEIC was declared on the 30th.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. From the viewpoint of the United Kingdom, what difference would it have made, if any, if a public health emergency of international concern had been declared on 23 January, as might have been possible, rather than on the 30th?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Difficult to say, but a declaration of a PHEIC does have certain implications from the International Health Regulations, and I think it would have probably brought forward some of the discussions going on with the SAGE. But it's difficult to speculate beyond that.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

At the beginning of February, on 3 February, SPI-M-O, the operational modelling subcommittee of SAGE, issued a consensus statement, and I'm just going to read out two of the conclusions, Professor. You won't find it on the page in front of you.

"The number of confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus in China is estimated to be at least ten times higher than the number currently confirmed."

Number 7 of the consensus minutes:

"It is unclear whether outbreaks can be contained by isolation and contact tracing."

If you had read on 3 February that consensus statement from SPI-M-O, what view, if any, would you have reached on the likelihood that the virus would inevitably reach the United Kingdom?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, I -- by that time I was pretty certain it would, because it was going -- it was already spreading at speed. Whether I would have agreed with their unanimous conclusion about it not -- that measures would not control it, is another issue. And I would not make that decision without consulting with East Asian groups and with WHO, who were making it very clear that at all costs you have to act fast to suppress the virus.

**Lead Inquiry**: I think to be fair to SPI-M-O, Professor, I read out the words that made it absolutely clear that they're talking about the cases in China, so all they were saying is, at number 7, it is unclear whether outbreaks, in parenthesis in China, can be contained by isolation and contact tracing. They weren't saying to the East Asian countries, other countries, "Don't put measures into place".

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, by 18 February, a report in early March showed, they had already in China nationally got their R0 below 1.

**Lead Inquiry**: We will come to that.

On 4 February, SAGE minutes record that the figures showed that potentially only one in 15 cases in China was being ascertained and that asymptomatic transmission cannot be ruled out and transmission from mildly symptomatic individuals is likely.

At what stage does a Government need to know the degree of likelihood of asymptomatic transmission before deciding whether to take proactive steps to put measures into place?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, obviously if you don't have an antibody test you can't measure it, so you have to make some good guesses on the basis of pandemic science, and if you were at some stage to show me the diagram that was published by Anderson, Ferguson and others after SARS-1, which shows the relationship between R0 and asymptomatic spread, then it would very clearly show to my Lady the limits and desirability of different strategies.

**Lead Inquiry**: That is in fact the 2004 report --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- to which you refer in your statement.

But I'm going to decline your invitation, Professor, and not put it to my Lady, because I'm driving at a different point, which is not whether the science shows that there are measures open to you to take, depending on the degree of asymptomatic transmission, but whether, given that it was understood by 4 February that asymptomatic transmission cannot be ruled out --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- you would have expected measures to be taken by that stage by the United Kingdom Government?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: To do?

**Lead Inquiry**: To take -- set up working groups, as you suggest in your statement, to --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah, I would have expected that the week before, yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- put a new test and trace and isolate system into place, to start seriously considering steps for social restriction, for breaking the physical gaps between members of the public to stop transmission. All this, Professor, before there are any more than a handful of cases in the United Kingdom?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah, I mean, we -- at that stage we had to assume that a pandemic was going to happen, it was spreading fast, and therefore we needed to know that we would have the basic tools for control rather than having to go into a kind of national lockdown with 400,000 people dying as a result of a 1% mortality rate.

So, you know, you have to weigh up options, but you want to make sure that the country has the option to control it, as indeed the East Asian states showed they could control it and suppress it, in the ensuing few weeks. So that's what I would have advised, yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Two questions, please.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm just wondering if that is a convenient moment.

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, yes, it is.

**Lady Hallett**: Do you want to ask those two questions?

**Mr Keith**: No, they will no doubt open another Pandora's box, so perhaps that is a convenient moment.

**Lady Hallett**: All right, 3.30, please.

*(3.15 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(3.30 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry for all the breaks in your evidence, Professor.

**Mr Keith**: Professor, on 22 February, United Kingdom passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship came back to the United Kingdom. The Inquiry has heard evidence that that was a cruise ship which was quarantined by the Japanese Government after there was an outbreak on board. I think a passenger tested positive for Covid having left the ship, and he had earlier been taken on board in Hong Kong, so the virus had spread on board.

The crucial feature, though, of that cruise ship and the infection was, wasn't it, that because they were all tested, the authorities in Japan and then the rest of the world were able to work out how many -- what the percentage was of those persons had showed no symptoms, and were there asymptomatic?

Around the same time there was a field report from the World Health Organisation, 24 February, which showed their up-to-date thinking in relation to the extent to which the virus was asymptomatic.

What was the impact, in your view, or what should have been the impact in your view, on the United Kingdom Government of those two separate pieces of knowledge?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, on the WHO report, they had gained access to China, a big independent 25-person team to go and look at the situation, and they measured the case numbers at the beginning and the end of their stay, which was nine days, and then they held -- they published a report straightaway and held a press conference. So it was very widely covered. And they basically laid out all the details of a proper mobilisation of a country. Remember, they didn't have a national lockdown, they had a local lockdown in Wuhan, and then in the rest of the country they put in place all that was needed to mobilise people, to get tests out there and, most importantly, to isolate and to support people to isolate. Their bills were paid, their food was paid. You know, they made sure that people weren't worried about isolating. Which was a huge problem in this country, as you know, later.

So there was the guidance that should have really been absolutely critical to guiding the UK response, but I didn't see any discussion of it in any of the minutes that I looked at, in SAGE.

**Lead Inquiry**: In essence, is your evidence that certainly by that stage, at the very latest, there should have been the pulling of a major alarm cord and a call for and the putting into place of a proper process of test, trace and isolate?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah, and support.

**Lead Inquiry**: The reality, Professor, can be seen from some of the SAGE minutes as to the extent of the testing system which was then in place. Could we have, please, INQ000057492, page 2.

This is the minutes again of 28 January which referred to the 400 to 500 tests per day. At paragraph 8, there we have it again:

"Specific test should be ready by the end of week, with capacity to run 400 to 500 tests per day."

Could we have INQ000051925, please, the third page.

This is dated 4 February, paragraph 26:

"Although the UK is building regional diagnostic capability within weeks ..."

Is "diagnostic" a word for scientific testing?

"... overall capacity is limited. Capacity cannot be substantially increased during this winter influenza season."

What does that mean?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: I'm not sure. Do they refer to the following winter, which would mean in another nine or ten months' time, or were they referring to the current end of winter, being the end of February? I'm not quite sure what that means.

**Lead Inquiry**: By 18 February, Professor, SAGE 8, Public Health England informed SAGE that they could cope with five coronavirus cases per week, generating 800 contacts that would need contact tracing. So each person who's infected goes into the system of contact tracing and isolation, each person generates a large number of contacts, five people would generate around 800 contacts, for argument's sake, that was the limit that PHE were saying they could deal with.

By this stage, 18 February, from the same standing start, how many people were South Korea testing?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: By -- I think it was by about 22 February, they were getting up to beyond 15,000 tests per day.

**Lead Inquiry**: 15,000 per day?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yes. And with regards to contact tracing, be aware, coverage is everything here. You know, people on the ground. Wuhan brought in 9,000 people for 11 million population. In Korea they mobilised a thousand junior doctors and many other volunteers to go to the hotspot areas of Daegu and another one.

So they were mobilising people very quickly. What I think they're referring to there at PHE was they had just 270, approximately, contact tracers.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there. So PHE had employed expert contact tracers, the people who phone round and contact and make sure that they can identify each contact of an infected person?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: But they had a number of -- a limited number of people available to do that job?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Within the narrowness of PHE. But across the country, we had a district public health protection team in every district. And my argument is that if we had wanted to mobilise, I worked out on coverage that to get the coverage of Wuhan you would need about 150 contact tracers per district on average, obviously proportional to the size of the population. So it would be possible, and indeed when they put out a call on March 24th for volunteers to help with the whole crisis, instead of getting 250,000 people that they wanted, they got 750,000. And they weren't subsequently used, they only used about 20,000 of them to do tasks. So my argument is a lot of those people would have been health workers, retired GPs, I know some that volunteered, and they could have been employed to help manage on the ground contact tracing and, most important, ensuring that people isolated and stayed isolated for 14 days.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there.

You've told us already that there was a limit on the number of existing Public Health England regional laboratories --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah. Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- who were in a position to do the testing, but that there were other specialist molecular virology laboratories capable of processing tests?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: In a number of statements from the Chief Medical Officer, the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, and other members of SAGE, there are references to the fact that those other specialist molecular virology laboratories didn't have the physical capacity to be able to scale up the testing to the sorts of levels that you have in mind. What do you say to that?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, I've heard this, and I would want to query if this is correct. If we had set up at the end of January a group, for example, with Sir Paul Nurse, Nobel prize winner Professor Venki Ramakrishnan --

**Lead Inquiry**: Well, don't worry, Professor, about the individuals.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Okay.

**Lead Inquiry**: I'm asking you questions about --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: All the experts --

**Lead Inquiry**: Excuse me.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Sorry, I beg your pardon.

**Lead Inquiry**: I'm asking you about the system --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- and whether the system could be scaled up to carry out the valuable work which you have said in your evidence was required to be done.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Could those molecular virology laboratories have been scaled up, do you think, to meet the sorts of numbers that you have in mind?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, Allan Wilson, the director of the Institute of Biomedical Science, I referred to in my witness statement, has said why did they go to a Wild West scenario, he called it, of lighthouse labs when they could have used their own backyard people, who were linked in with all of the NHS facilities, so that the reporting of case -- of tests could have been quickly used to control the virus.

So my view is that an independent group should need to look and see whether we could have done this. But we are a big biomedical country, we have a lot of expertise across universities, across many different research facilities, and I would be surprised if these people, when consulted, could not have made a material contribution, but they weren't invited to do so.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. So is this the position -- and it's very important that the Inquiry understands whether you have evidence that shows that a vital step ought to have been taken but was not, and that it was available to the authorities to take that step -- you don't know whether or not those molecular virology laboratories could have been scaled up in time, and obviously the virus was spreading, but your understanding is there were alternative measures or alternative supplies, facilities, that should have been used but were not?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct. And on contact tracing the same. We have 5,000 environmental contact tracers, and I believe the sexual health contact tracers amounted to several hundred, and they were offered to the team in the Department of Health, and it was not accepted.

**Lead Inquiry**: Do you know when that was, Professor?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: This was -- it was ... I'd need to check. I can go through later, I don't want to hold you up.

**Lead Inquiry**: I don't believe that those offers were being made in February, which is when you --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No, not in February. No, you're right.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- say the precautionary principle --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- it's necessary to take these early steps to get on top of the virus.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Exactly.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. So that may not take us much further at this point.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

The government stopped all community testing on 12 March, and to recall the position, Professor, there were around about, at that time, some -- well, fewer than a 500 cases --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: 500, yeah, and about 10 deaths I think.

**Lead Inquiry**: What was the significance of the government stopping testing in the community?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: I think their explanation was that they had limited number of tests and so they wanted to focus on hospitals, to make sure they could test there and presumably, later, other care facilities. But it was interesting that the very next day Dr Tedros put out a statement, I think aimed at the UK Government, saying it is -- in switching from containment to mitigation is both wrong and dangerous just because we've declared a pandemic. Because it was on the 12th the government were saying because WHO had declared a pandemic, which kind of everyone knew was taking place, that that was why they stopped testing. And I think that was a bit of a non sequitur.

**Lead Inquiry**: Your evidence is that the government's explanation was that they had stopped community testing because they had limited number of tests --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- and they wanted to focus on hospitals?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: So if the reality, Professor, was they had to stop community testing because they had no tests and what tests they did have had to be focused on hospitals and the sick and the dying, why do you say in your statement that the United Kingdom should not -- you say it:

"... stopped all community testing ... This should not have happened."

Isn't the reality that they had to stop community testing because they ran out of tests?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah, but we'd had six weeks where we could have prepared for this I believe in a way that Korea did, that China, that all the others did. I need to be convinced that in that six weeks of inaction, because of their strategy saying this was pandemic flu, that they could not have generated sufficient tests to cover the hotspot areas that we had at that time. That's the key to suppression.

**Lead Inquiry**: So the position is, then, Professor, isn't it, that it wasn't that decision to stop community testing on 12 March --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- that was so wrong, it is that the reality of having to stop community testing was reflective of the terrible position in which the country had got itself, which is that there had been, by that stage, no attempt to scale up --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- the testing process?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

In your statement, you then proceed to another error, or "fatal error" you describe it as, on the part of the government, which was to remove the possibility of epidemic suppression. So this issue of the government pursuing mitigation of a virus, of the virus, by way of reducing the levels of incidence, the spread, the overall numbers, as opposed to suppressing it and stopping it in its tracks.

From what you've said, there was by early March no effective scaled up test, trace, contact, isolate, support system in place; correct?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: There were no real measures short of a lockdown that would stop the virus in its track, because there was no test, trace, contact, isolate, support structure in place; correct?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: In the early stages, remember in China and in South Korea they didn't have a test necessarily at the scaled --

**Lead Inquiry**: I'm sorry to talk over you. I'm asking you specifically about early March.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: You've established very effectively that South Korea, which developed a diagnostic test on the same day as the United Kingdom --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- scaled up its processes whereas we did not.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: But by early March, which is what I'm asking you about, given that there was no test, trace, contact, isolate support system, we had dropped the ball --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- given that there was no other non-pharmaceutical intervention measure short of a lockdown that would have the same benefits as a proper test, trace, isolate system, why does it matter if strategically the British Government did tell everyone it was continuing to pursue a mitigation rather than a suppression strategy?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, the first reason is that we ended up with serial lockdowns. We ended up with the biggest economic damage to our country in 300 years. We ended up with £407 billion spent on furlough schemes, because it spread across the population. We ended up with £450 billion of QE by the Bank of England. So massive economic damage.

**Lead Inquiry**: Professor, I'm very sorry to interrupt you again. That wasn't an invitation for an impressively fluent --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No --

**Lead Inquiry**: Please forgive me -- retrospective view of the entirety of the Covid pandemic.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No, 2020.

**Lead Inquiry**: I asked you: why does it matter in March 2020 that the government, and you showed us the SAGE minutes where they still pursued the mitigation strategy, why does it matter then that they go for mitigation rather than suppression if they had no practical means by which to mitigate properly?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Because you were going to need a find, test, trace, isolate and support system.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Because what happened was, without an effective one, the first lockdown ended, we got it right down to nearly 500 cases per day, and then it just came back up again, because we never had an effective find, test, trace and isolate.

So even if we were late, it was better to develop one and save subsequent infection, transmission and deaths than to not do anything at all.

**Lead Inquiry**: So the answer, then, Professor --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- is this, isn't it: that for those people in the government who in March were saying, "We must suppress the sombrero, we must reduce the level of the outbreak, to avoid suppressing one wave -- mitigating one wave and then being hit by a second wave", in order to be able to deal with that second wave when it surely re-emerged --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- they would have had to have, they needed to have a proper test, trace, isolate, support system in place --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- by the time of the second wave --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- which of course struck in the late autumn?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: That's what you're saying?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: So the absence of a test and trace system resulted in a lockdown because there was no alternative, it resulted in the virus getting away from the United Kingdom, spreading uncontrollably in March, and it also ensured that we were hit by a second wave?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

You are critical of the government's strategy document that was published on 3 March, which is the contain, delay document.

We'll just have that on the screen, INQ000237322.

You'll recall, Professor, this is the document in which the government sets out its strategy, if we go forward to the first page, of containing, delaying, mitigating, researching -- perhaps one more page -- I'm afraid I can't remember, I think it may be page 4. Let's try page 10, at 3.9. Ah, yes. The overall phases are: contain, delay, research, mitigate.

So as at 3 March, step 1 of the government's strategy was detect early cases, follow up :outline:`close contacts` and prevent the disease taking hold in this country for as long as is reasonably possible.

By 3 March, in the absence of a scaled-up test system, had containment of the disease already been lost?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Effectively, because they -- I think Chris Whitty, in the -- 5 March, when he was giving evidence to the Health Select Committee, indicated that they were on the cusp of moving to a delay phase.

Can I just add one small point?

**Lead Inquiry**: Please.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: This plan, contain, delay, research, mitigate, what confuses me is that both Sir Jeremy Farrar and John Edmunds have both said that this was never discussed at SAGE.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes. My Lady's received evidence, and will receive further evidence, on that, Professor, thank you.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Thank you.

**Lead Inquiry**: Herd immunity --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- is a related issue, again of which you are -- you have much to say in your statement.

If you have a system, Professor, as the government, on your evidence, appeared to have, that the only thing that could be done with the virus was chop off the top level, mitigate it, suppress it, but allow a significant body of it to pass through the population, is herd immunity simply a recognition that that is a byproduct of such a strategy? If you don't suppress a virus completely, it will pass through the population and eventually that part of the population through which it passes will gain immunity, hence herd immunity. Is that what this argument is? Is that what this issue is about?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, that only depends upon whether the virus induces persisting immunity. So if you, for example, with rubella, German measles as it's sometimes called, before vaccination many children would get this, and it would give them pretty much lifelong immunity, but this -- coronaviruses are well known for not inducing such effective immunity, rather like flu, so the ideal is to get to a point where herd immunity is brought about by vaccination, given however frequently you need to boost the level of immunity. But herd immunity does mean that the virus has got nowhere else to go.

**Lead Inquiry**: So are you saying that an additional concern at this time was not just the wisdom of the strategy, but you were unclear as to whether or not -- or what the degree of immunity that allowing the virus to pass through the population --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- would engender?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Exactly. And there was the work of, you know, Sunetra Gupta and others who put forward this view that in fact most people had been infected and that actually everything was going to die out very quickly, and the problem was that when the testing for antibodies came in, they did not find that.

**Lead Inquiry**: It became apparent that, relatively speaking --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- a very small part of the population --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Exactly.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- by the summer --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: 5%, 6% or something. Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

Now, two documents which you produced at the time, around this time, which is now mid-March, please, Professor, you wrote to Chris Whitty, Professor Sir Chris Whitty, on 15 March, INQ000282428, and you copied it to Richard Horton, the editor of The Lancet?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: And to a couple of other --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: I think to David Nabarro, to Devi Sridhar and Jason Hickel.

**Lead Inquiry**: Who are all scientists?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Of varying descriptions.

**Lead Inquiry**: "Dear Chris,

"I know you must be incredibly busy and under great pressure. I quite understand the need to stagger some measures around social distancing ..."

Pausing there, by this time, Professor, the UK Government had announced the imposition of certain relatively limited social distancing measures --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- correct?

"... but many of us are at a loss to understand why the government has abandoned intensive population surveillance, contact tracing and quarantine nationwide, which is the bedrock of WHO advice on epidemic control."

Then you refer to South Korea, by implication, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. And then you say this, in the last sentence of the second paragraph:

"... without it [that is to say population surveillance], I fail to see how you can really delay a huge epidemic in the next month which could totally overload the health system."

And of course, in the absence of a lockdown, the overloading of the health system is exactly what would have happened.

By that reference to population surveillance, although you don't use the word, did you mean testing as part of a surveillance contact, trace, isolation system?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Ideally, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right. Because without testing there can be no proper surveillance, contact tracing --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- isolation, support? All right.

Another document I want to ask your view on so that we can be clear about your position is the tweet that you sent on 13 March, two days before, INQ000268213:

"Doesn't this herd immunity strategy conflict with WHO Policy?"

Then you refer to Dr Tedros' remarks?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah, yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that a reference to what you've just told us, which is that you were challenging the wisdom of this byproduct of herd immunity because it conflicted directly with what Dr Tedros had himself recommended, which is --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- don't mitigate, don't chop the top level off --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- don't allow herd immunity as a byproduct, but suppress, suppress, suppress?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

In your statement, another area of concern is that of -- expressed by you -- behavioural fatigue?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: The Inquiry has heard evidence, Professor, that at a press conference in early March and in COBR, the Chief Medical Officer said something along the lines of, "If we go too early with stringent measures, people will understandably get fatigued", and you have been very critical of the notion that people would, over time, decline to comply, to conform to non-pharmaceutical interventions, saying that there is no forensic or epidemiological basis for that idea; is that the nub of it?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yes, I mean, I was drawing upon the psychologists who were on Independent SAGE and helping to advise us, and who actually -- one of whom was on SPI-B, Dr -- Professor Stephen Reicher, and he made it clear that, you know, some of the statements coming out, "There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued" and "The British would not accept Wuhan-style measures", that actually this was not correct and in fact the evidence showed that we did abide by lockdown measures to a great extent. And also that if you get the support right, as later happened in New York, where they were given generous support for self-isolation, you got 94% compliance, whereas in this country many poor people did not comply with self-isolation simply because they couldn't afford to do so, and our -- the -- we were not generous with sick pay, we spent £54 million in 2020 on sick pay, and we ended up, as I said earlier, spending vast billions on a furlough scheme.

So if we had got that right, there is no reason why there would have been behavioural fatigue, especially as isolation was the nub of the control policy.

**Lead Inquiry**: You are critical in your statement of a particular body in the Cabinet Office called the Behavioural Insights Team, BIT, or at least you suggest that its director was the genesis, the origin of behavioural fatigue as a notion.

Could I just ask you, please, to look at some minutes from SAGE on 13 March.

That's INQ000109142, page 4 of 5.

Paragraph 30 says this, under the heading, Professor, of "Behavioural science considerations", so this is 13 March, social restrictions have been in place but we're short of the lockdown so far:

"Difficulty maintaining behaviours should not be treated as a reason for not communicating with the public about the efficacy of the behaviours [and this] and should not be taken as a reason to delay implementation where that is indicated epidemiologically."

So my question for you is this, and it's the last question: do you accept that, regardless of the public debate about behavioural fatigue and its validity, SAGE recognised that difficulty maintaining behaviour should not be taken as a reason to delay the implementation, the imposition of non-pharmaceutical interventions?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yes, and I would also actually withdraw that statement about David Halpern, given that I read his own witness statement and presence here last week in which he said he clearly did not support that view. So since he's said that, I would take that back. I heard that from other people.

So, yes, I would agree with that.

Can I just say one thing or have you got to finish now?

**Mr Keith**: It's a matter for my Lady. There are some further Rule 10 questions, I believe.

**Lady Hallett**: There are some questions to come. Let's see what happens when --

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Okay.

**Lady Hallett**: -- Ms Morris has asked the questions, Professor, and we'll, if necessary, come back to the point you wish to make.

Ms Morris.

Questions From Ms Morris KC

**Ms Morris**: Thank you, my Lady.

Professor Costello, I ask questions on behalf of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice. Just on one topic, please, and that is a press conference, 26 March 2020, hosted by the then Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and Professor Dame Jenny Harries. I think you might have seen some YouTube footage of that press conference in preparation for your evidence today; is that right?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Mm.

**Ms Morris KC**: And you remember it?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: I have seen it, but I haven't seen it recently, but I think I know what you're going to say.

**Ms Morris KC**: Thank you.

My Lady, a copy of it is going to be disclosed on Relativity. I'm afraid, for technical reasons, I can't take the Professor to a video now, so I'm going to have to summarise it for him.

It's a press conference that causes the families that I represent some significant concern, and it was 26 March, as I say, it's after you'd written an article yourself, 20th March, called "The United Kingdom is flying blind on Covid-19", and Professor Dame Jenny Harries responded to a question about the WHO guidance called "Test, test, test". Is that the guidance you mentioned in your evidence a moment ago, 24 February, or did it come a little later?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Her "Test, test" -- the guidance from --

**Ms Morris KC**: The WHO guidance.

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, they -- I was going to say in response to that, because she said the WHO didn't apply to --

**Ms Morris KC**: I'm going to come to that, but just to get some dates clear, if I can. Was that guidance at the end of February?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Yes.

**Ms Morris KC**: Thank you. Okay, so just to give you some context Professor Dame Jenny Harries says this:

"The clue for WHO was in its title, it's the World Health Organisation, and it's addressing all countries across the world, with entirely different health infrastructures and particularly public health infrastructures. We have an extremely well developed public health system in this country", and then she talks about training other countries and offering expertise and experience. So the point there is that they're all addressing every country, including lower middle-income countries, so encouraging all countries to test of some type.

"When you come to the UK we've made it very, very clear there has been a plan right the way through this, which is entirely consistent with the science and epidemiology. We started with a containment phase and every early case of this disease was followed through, every contact was traced exactly as we would do for other diseases but particularly noticing this one, and of course the viewers will be very familiar with the fact that we had some very strict and very successful containment facilities. But there comes a point in the pandemic where that's not an appropriate intervention and that is the point really where we moved, we moved into delay, and although we still do do some contact tracing and testing, for example in high-risk areas like prisons or care homes, that is not an appropriate mechanism as we go forward. At that point what we need to do is focus on the clinical management of the patients first and foremost and then additionally, as I have said earlier, on our health and care staff and first responders staff. So obviously if there was an infinite testing facility, and we are growing them at pace and we will have them, then it moves to the public, but we need to be very careful about focusing where it is clinically most valuable."

I've just read that out so you have the context and my Lady has the direct quotation from the relevant part of the video.

So, having regard to what you've said this afternoon about what should have happened, in your view, by 26 March, my first question is: is this press conference an example of the United Kingdom promoting itself as world class or exceptional to other countries?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: Well, yes. I disagree with almost everything that was stated there. As you know, there was an assessment of pandemic preparedness where USA was 1 and we were number 2 -- this was by Johns Hopkins in 2019 -- and we ended up with five times the death rates of the East Asian states. So we've had 228,000 people die with Covid-19 on death certificates, 208,000 excess deaths, and that is a huge public health disaster. And if we'd had the South Korean, for example -- and remember South Korea, Japan are not poor countries, they have the same life expectancy if not better, same age, same GDP, and similar health systems to us, they took a different policy, and if we had followed their policy I would argue we could have stopped upwards towards 150,000 deaths.

So I disagree with her on that point.

I think she also made a comment about WHO only being appropriate for poor countries, or something similar to that. Can I just say one thing about that? The WHO put out, on February 3, a strategic preparedness and response plan and they said there are six priority actions: control transmission, do find, test, trace, isolate, outbreaks minimised in health facilities and nursing homes, preventative measures in workplaces and schools, importation risks are managed and communities educated, engaged and empowered. They put that out to every country in the world.

I would argue that we didn't do much of that.

**Ms Morris KC**: Understood, thank you.

My second question relating to the reference in the press conference to the plan of containment and delay being entirely consistent with the science and epidemiology, do you agree with that statement?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: No, I don't.

**Ms Morris KC**: And, thirdly, was there any evidence that contact tracing in vulnerable locations, for example care homes, was happening in a meaningful way in March 2020?

**Professor Anthony Costello**: I don't think so.

**Ms Morris**: Thank you very much, Professor, those are my questions.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Morris.

Is that it?

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Professor Costello.

**The Witness**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm very grateful for your help.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Mr Keith**: The next witness will be examined by Mr Keating.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Mr Keating.

**Mr Keating**: Thank you, my Lady, may I call Professor Andrew Hayward, please.

*(Pause)*

**Lady Hallett**: I'm sorry you have been kept waiting for so long, Professor.

**The Witness**: No problem.
