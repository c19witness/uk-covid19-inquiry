6. Submissions on Behalf of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice and Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Northern Ireland by Ms Morris KC
========================================================================================================================================

**Ms Morris**: Thank you, my Lady. On behalf of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice and Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Northern Ireland -- I'm sure Ms Campbell will prod me if I make any submissions that she's not content with me to make -- we indicated on Friday that we wanted to make some oral submissions to you on this topic, but that was before we received the submissions provided by Mr Bunting King's Counsel made on behalf of eight media organisations, with which we entirely agree and endorse.

All that I will add is that the bereaved families have the utmost interest in open justice and transparency at this Inquiry, and therefore even if Article 8 is engaged, which we don't entirely accept, the significance of this Inquiry and the significance of the evidence that Mr Vallance has to give to it weigh in favour of the fullest evidence in its proper context being published.

So, my Lady, those are my short submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Just before you sit down, I'm afraid I'm going to use you, Ms Morris, because Mr Bunting is not here.

**Ms Morris**: I'm a poor substitute but I'll do my best, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: The submissions from the media organisations don't seem to address the Prince of Wales case, which I was reading just before I came in to hear the submissions. Do you have any comments about the judgment of the Lord Chief Justice and Master of the Rolls in --

**Ms Morris**: I would have to defer to Mr Bunting on that one, I'm afraid.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm sorry if I asked you a -- threw a fast ball.

**Ms Morris**: No, my Lady, I'm entirely content to try to assist you if I can, but it won't be in this moment, I'm afraid.

**Lady Hallett**: Don't worry, I'll read the judgment myself. Thank you very much.

Anybody -- oh, yes, we have. Submissions of the UK Health Security Agency by MS DOLAN KC

**Ms Dolan**: My Lady, I intend to only address you very briefly to express the views of the UK Health Security Agency. I hope to be of assistance to you in delineating the issues that we say you need to decide here.

We do say, my Lady, that first you will need to determine whether Article 8 rights are engaged. It appears to UKHSA that the information within the personal reflective evening notes of Sir Patrick must engage the protections of Article 8 of the Convention, given the nature of those notes and how and why these notes were created.

My Lady, we say the Court of Appeal decision in the Prince of Wales case against the Associated news press makes that abundantly clear. They are, we might even say, more protected, if that is possible, than the manner in which the Prince of Wales had created his diary notes, in the way these personal reflective notes came to be created and their purpose.

My learned friend Ms Mitchell seems to suggest to you that the Article 8 issue has already been dealt with because you've balanced that when you came to the view that the notes with the small redactions should be provided to all core participants.

My Lady, we'd say that approach is misconceived. These personal notes do not lose the protection of Article 8 for all purposes just because you have decided that they can be disclosed under the strict undertakings that you've required of all of us to the core participants.

My Lady, if you agree that Article 8 is attracted by these notes, then of course you will have to go on to consider the real issue that is being challenged here, which is whether the display and publication of the disputed information will be a further interference with the Article 8 rights.

Now, what is currently being proposed by your inquest legal team is that material that is irrelevant to the particular question or issue that the witness is being asked about, or is being probed by your counsel or probed by any core participant, because we are all at liberty to ask questions about these notes -- that material that is irrelevant to the probing issue will be displayed on the screen simply because it happens to appear on the same page as the relevant material which is being asked about.

That is the issue, whether that should happen. And of course, my Lady, also remembering these are transcribed notes. They were written in Sir Patrick's handwriting. Your team have put in a lot of work to cope with the handwriting by transcribing them into a Word document. Matters may appear on a particular page just because of the way they've been transcribed.

**Lady Hallett**: I did check on that. I think I was assured that in fact they appear on the same page as the original. I think. I was interested in that point as well.

**Ms Dolan**: Be that as it may, my Lady, we understand Sir Patrick's objection is only to displaying, and then obviously publishing the next day, this extraneous information. That is not considered by yourself, the Inquest legal team or any core participant who is asking a question to be material to the question or the issue that is being asked.

In our view, to reveal private and irrelevant information, I mean irrelevant to the topics anybody wants to enquire into, must be an interference with Article 8 rights.

So then the question you must ask, my Lady, is: is there lawful justification for that interference? Because it will only become an infringement of an Article 8 right if the interference is not justified.

Any interference must have a lawful justification under Article 8.2 and, put broadly in this case, the matter for your consideration will be: is it necessary to display this extraneous material when you are balancing the rights of others?

Your public inquiry team seem to readily accept the material wouldn't otherwise be displayed on the screen or even released to the public if it didn't happen to be incidentally located on that particular page, and the only reason put forward by your team for it being necessary to reveal this extraneous material is their own administrative convenience.

Now, my Lady, we don't make light of the burden that is on your team. Our team are receiving the documents that are being disclosed by your team and it runs to tens of thousands of pages for this entire Covid Inquiry, but of course what your team is saying is it would create an additional work for teams who are already working extremely hard if they had to prepare these documents in a way that only revealed the material people want to ask about. It's simply too much work for them, they say, to cut and paste from the Word document and then only display the relevant material the screen.

What we say is it's just not necessary to display this material, and administrative convenience is not a sufficient reason for you to justify the interference with any individual's Article 8 rights, and administrative convenience is the only matter being put forward by your team for why it's not being done.

You must, of course, consider the position of the press and their Article 10 rights, the press and the public, and what Mr Bunting KC says is that Article 10 is engaged and that, in the spirit of openness and transparency, the press and the public should have full access to the evidence presented in these public inquiry hearings.

My Lady, of course that must be right. The principle of open justice doesn't need repeating by me. They are very good ones that you should follow and that UKHSA support. But the question you must ask is: openness and transparency about what? Sir Patrick is not objecting to anyone seeing any information that is relevant to any question anybody wants to ask of him or of another witness, and that includes your team and core participants.

There is no issue being taken by Sir Patrick about anybody using this material to probe it and to probe it with any witness. No suggestion for curtailing Article 10 rights in that respect. The press can freely report anything said in this room, and will be able to freely report the content of anything that is put to a witness by anybody. It's for that reason it doesn't appear to us this is a request for a section 19 restriction order either, as the press have construed it in their written submissions.

If section 19 does bite here, surely the necessary restriction has already been directed by you when, for very good reason at the outset of this Inquiry, you ordered that no person may publish documents received by the Inquiry which have been shared with all of the core participants. You required us all to sign strict undertakings that we wouldn't do so, save of course when those documents are put into public during the evidence and properly probed.

As you have already recognised, in your own control and your own oversight of that disclosure process, the press and the public are simply not entitled to see a copy of every document that everybody has handed to you. It's the ones that are relevant to the Inquiry in public that of course should be made public.

So, my Lady, we say the real point you must consider in determining this application is whether material irrelevant to any question asked by anyone should be presented -- sorry, extraneous to any question asked by anybody should be presented in public in these hearings at all. Sir Patrick only seeks a ruling that when his personal reflective evening notes are displayed in public, the only parts put on screen and later published on the Inquiry website are the parts that him or another witness is asked about or a core participant wishes to refer to.

The UKHSA do support that request. We say extraneous material and personal notes should not be shown simply because it appears on the same page as the relevant matters that are properly being probed in the Inquiry, and that inconvenience to the Inquiry legal team to abridge pages -- and we say that's the correct word, this is not about redaction, it's about abridging to the relevant matters -- and that abridgment may be administratively inconvenient but that it should still be done.

My Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed.

Anybody else? Mr Keith.
