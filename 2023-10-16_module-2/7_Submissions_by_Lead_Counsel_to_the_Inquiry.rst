7. Submissions by Lead Counsel to the Inquiry
=============================================

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, the issue at the heart of this particular argument is whether the principle of openness demands that where CTI or a core participant has referred to a particular passage from a page of Sir Patrick's evening notes in the examination of any witness, and has had that passage put up on the screen, the rest of the page, perhaps even the rest of the diary, part of which would have been displayed alongside the particular excerpt, must then be published and made available to the press.

My Lady, in fact just to make absolutely plain the factual premise of this argument and, I apologise to the core participants, to move a little way the target at which they have been aiming, Mrs Laura Taylor, who is the Module 2 lead solicitor, assures the Inquiry legal team that it is quite straightforward in practice to type up each excerpt to which any witness may be -- may have that passage referred to, individually on a separate page, on the screen, and therefore, in the course of time, to have that particular page with only that particular excerpt published.

But the point of principle is still required to be resolved by you, my Lady, because, firstly, that doesn't dispose of the issue as to whether or not in any event there is an obligation for the rest of that page and the original diary to be published or the rest of the diary itself. And also the ruling may have relevance to other dairies which are in the possession of the Inquiry, parts of which may also be put up in due course by way of individual excerpts.

The ruling may also have relevance to WhatsApps and texts, because the WhatsApps form part of groups and the texts form part of screenshots, although of course very different weighing up considerations will apply to such material because they are all, by definition, material sent by one person to another, and therefore the engagement of privacy rights is attenuated.

Turning to the substance of the legal argument, the first issue for you is whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy on Sir Patrick's part. In essence, is there an interference with his Article 8 rights?

My Lady, the excerpts all come from a diary which was compiled and held privately, and Sir Patrick has explained it was not meant to be published or, indeed, known to anyone. And of course he has given it to the Inquiry only because the Inquiry sought its provision under Rule 9. The diary is confidential and of a private nature, even though, of course, the contents traverse matters that were very much in the public domain, and of course are relevant to the Inquiry's work.

It may be thought that a diary is a paradigm example of material protected by confidentiality. You may conclude his views were private and protected by privacy, even if what he talked about was not.

His notes were given to the Inquiry quite properly and to the core participants, but the notes which have been provided to the core participants are still protected by confidentiality obligations. They're held subject to an undertaking. Although many members of the groups will have seen the material under the terms of those undertakings, many others have not, and the confidentiality obligations still endure.

So Sir Patrick's reasonable expectation of confidentiality and privacy still endures.

My Lady, the heart of this part of the legal argument may be thought to be this: such part of the notes as has been disclosed to the core participants was disclosed because it was relevant to that particular part of the Inquiry process, that is to say the provision of material to the core participants to meaningfully engage in this process. They weren't disclosed to the core participants to enable the core participants to publish them or with an expectation that they would automatically be published. So you may readily conclude Sir Patrick still has a reasonable expectation of privacy.

The second argument concerns the well known weighing up exercise between Article 10 and Article 8. Article 10, the freedom of expression, is of vital importance in the freedom of the press, it is statutorily reinforced by section 12.4 of the Human Rights Act, and it is an important Convention right. But on the facts of this case, it is limited in this particular way: we are not here dealing with a case in which a document has been given to a judge by way of a skeleton argument in the course of an open extradition hearing, the Guardian News and Media case, where plainly openness and the principle of transparency demands that material be published and made available.

Nor is it a case in which material has gone to a decision-maker in the course of a criminal trial, where plainly the principles of open justice demand that such evidence or material be publicly disclosed. This is material which has so far only been given to core participants under confidentiality undertakings in the course of a public inquiry.

My Lady, you will recall well, of course, the general advice in the Prince of Wales case, which you are familiar with. Neither article has precedence over the other automatically. There must be an intense focus on the comparative importance of the right being claimed on the facts of the case. The justifications for interference with each right must be taken into account. And the proportionality approach in Bank Mellat in the Supreme Court must be applied.

Article 8 undoubtedly applies because, for the same reasons which deal with the reasonable expectation of privacy, the material, by virtue of being given to the core participants, has not been made publicly available.

In that weighing up exercise, you may conclude that the following particular aspects are of great importance:

1. The confidentiality of dairies reflect an important public interest.

2. Private dairies engage the highest level of confidentiality, Sir Patrick Vallance has the right to a private space, the right to be able to commit his private thoughts to writing and to keep them private, the more so as he is a public figure.

3. The press will be able to publish, of course, those parts of the dairies which are put to witnesses and are put on the screen by way of the individual excerpts appearing on a single identifiable page, they don't need the rest of the diary to be published in order to be able to publish that material.

4. Matters which are not drawn to the particular attention of a witness by CTI or the core participants, and are not put up on the screen, are by definition of lesser public interest.

5. Sir Patrick Vallance would not have expected and could not reasonably have been expected, when he provided the dairies to the Inquiry, that the whole of the diary would be published, not just the parts that were put to witnesses. He would only have expected that the core participants themselves would be able to see all the material, bar sensitive and irrelevant parts.

6. You have the useful analogy with the Associated Newspapers case in which Prince Charles successfully persuaded the Court of Appeal to grant relief restraining publication of eight handwritten journals which, although copied to the Mail on Sunday by a disgruntled member of staff, had been seen by and disclosed to between 50 and 75 advisers or officials. His claim to breach of confidence and interference with Article 8 rights was upheld.

So, my Lady, those are the core features in the weighing up exercise which must be weighed, of course, in that balance between the extremely important right of freedom of expression, attenuated though it is in the particular circumstances of this case, and the Article 8 rights of Sir Patrick Vallance.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Keith. I think you may need to express your appreciation to the stenographer. You were going quite speedily.

**Mr Keith**: Luckily my diction is now extremely familiar to our hard-working, beloved stenographer, but I apologise if it was faster than usual.

**Lady Hallett**: I couldn't even get in to interrupt.

Right. Now we're returning to Professor Costello. I should just like to say that having heard those submissions I shall reflect upon them very carefully, I'd also like to go over the judgments that people have referred to in their witness statements again, and I will give my decision as soon as I am ready to do so. In the meantime, we will continue with the same system we have been utilising to date, which is that if we don't have the system in place whereby just the passage can be put up online, then counsel will read out the relevant passage until I have reached my decision.

**Mr Keith**: Thank you very much, my Lady, that's extremely helpful.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.
