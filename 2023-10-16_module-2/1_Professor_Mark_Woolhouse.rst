Transcript of Module 2 Public Hearing on 16 October 2023

*(10.30 am)*

**Lady Hallett**: Mr O'Connor.

**Mr O'Connor**: Good morning, my Lady. Our first witness this morning is Professor Mark Woolhouse.

1. Professor Mark Woolhouse
===========================

*PROFESSOR MARK WOOLHOUSE (affirmed).*

Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Mr O'Connor**: Could you give us your full name, please.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Mark Edward John Woolhouse.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Professor Woolhouse, you have kindly prepared a witness statement for our module of the Inquiry, that's Module 2.

It's up on screen before us. We don't need to look at the last page but I'm sure you're familiar with the contents of this statement.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I am.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You will recall that at the end of the statement there is a statement of truth indicating that you believe the contents of that statement to be true, and you have signed that with a date of 15 August of this year. Is that right?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I have, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Professor, you have, of course, given evidence to this Inquiry before. You came and gave oral evidence here during the Module 1 hearings in July, I think it was, so thank you very much for coming back to give evidence again for Module 2. I know that the details of your career were covered last time, but just briefly, you are a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, are you not?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I am, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You're also a member of the Usher Institute, which is the University of Edinburgh's school of public health?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I am, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Finally, you are the principal investigator of the Epidemiology Research Group at Edinburgh University, which conducts scientific research on infectious diseases including novel emerging pathogens, both in Scotland and globally?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And as we shall hear, of course, including Covid-19?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It did.

**Counsel Inquiry**: During the pandemic, Professor, we know from your statement, and of course we'll be talking much about this in the next hour or so, you were a member of the committee SPI-M-O?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Which of course was chaired or at least co-chaired by Professor Medley, who we heard from last week.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: He had been a member of SPI-M before that, before the committee was operationalised, as it were, in January 2020. Were you a long-standing member of that committee or not?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No, I was not, I was co-opted around about January 20th, I think. Mid-January.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, and do we take it, then, that you ceased to be a member of the committee I think it was in February 2022, when the committee reverted back to its pre-pandemic footing?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We've also of course heard about SAGE, which is the committee that SPI-M-O fed up to. Did you attend SAGE meetings during the pandemic?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No, I didn't.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We've heard from some witnesses that they attended maybe just one or two. Did you in fact attend any SAGE meetings?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: None at all.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Then finally, you were also a member of the Scottish Covid-19 Advisory Group. We did hear a little from Professor Medley, and also from Professor Keeling, about the modelling groups that were established in Scotland and Wales. Was this the Scottish modelling group or was it something a bit different?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No, the Scottish Government's Covid-19 Advisory Group, its informal name was SAGE for Scotland, so it was more at that level rather than the detailed model --

**Counsel Inquiry**: So it had a broader remit than simply modelling?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I want to start in detail, Professor, by asking you some questions about the very start of the pandemic, and in particular a series of emails that you sent and received towards the end of January 2020.

But just before we go to the emails themselves, can I take you to a passage in your witness statement which describes them. So it's paragraph 273. You will see it's come up on screen. No, that seems to be the wrong reference. Let me just double-check. We can take that down, that's not quite right.

*(Pause)*

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's not worry about the statement, let's go straight to the emails, thank you.

So can we go, please, first of all, to INQ000103349, page 6.

*(Pause)*

**Counsel Inquiry**: Could we go on another page? In fact, I think, to the last page of the document. I think I've got different page numbers. Is that the last page? Is there another page? That's it. So in fact we might need to go back to the page before, just to catch the start of that. That's it, thank you.

So this is an email, Professor, that you sent to Jeremy Farrar on Tuesday, 21 January; is that right?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just tell us, Sir Jeremy Farrar at the time was, worked for the Wellcome institute, I think that's right?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: He was director of the Wellcome Trust, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And someone who you knew or knew well?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I knew well, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: He is now the chief scientist of the World Health Organisation?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: He is.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So that's the context. We'll look at the email in a little detail in a moment, but can you just introduce it, why did you contact him then and what was your concern?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I had become very concerned over events in Wuhan, going back to roughly January 8th, when I'd received a copy of a report, actually from the Wuhan municipal health authority, which alarmed me greatly. It seemed to me to be containing evidence that a pandemic was under way --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- and possibly was already irreversible. So -- sorry.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So, we see, after you've asked him or hoped that everything is well with him, you question are you "right to be increasingly concerned about the slow drip feed of ... information on the Wuhan coronavirus".

There is then a paragraph where you go into a little more detail as to what you've seen and what your concerns are.

Then if we can go forward to the next page, please, I just want to pick it up with the last paragraph, last substantive paragraph, you say:

"My own position is that there is a very significant likelihood of this going global (I've thought that for a while, but the likelihood is increasing daily at the moment). In which case, it would be prudent to start planning for that eventuality ..."

Does that capture your thoughts at the time?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It does. And you asked me why I contacted Jeremy Farrar --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- and the reason is that I valued his opinion on this. He's very expert in this area.

**Counsel Inquiry**: He of course wasn't working in any form of sort of governmental role at the time?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I believe not.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The Wellcome institute was not a part of government. So was it more just a question of using him as a sounding board to check whether he agreed with you, with your concerns?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, I very much value Jeremy's opinion.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I want to move forward now to his response, and I'm not sure I've got the correct page numbers, I think it might be page 3, but perhaps we can go -- it's a response from ... it's an email from ...

Sorry, I think we can actually go to a different document. Can we go to, please, INQ000103227.

It's an email that you sent to Neil Ferguson, and page -- which I think might well -- I hope is on page 3 of that document. Yes, could we go to the next page, please.

So here we see an email that you sent a few days later. On this occasion you sent it to both Jeremy Farrar but also to Neil Ferguson.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's right, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: He is someone who, of course, is giving evidence to the Inquiry tomorrow, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, a professional friend or colleague?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, I've known Neil for many, many years, and again somebody whose views on this matter I would greatly value.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we look at this email together, Professor, again, it's on very much the same theme, is it not?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It is.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of expressing your concern --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, it's the same thing but with more numbers, more data.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In particular, if we see in the second paragraph, you are focusing on the R number being 2 and the case fatality rate of 4%?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just in a few sentences tell us why those numbers are significant, or at least the significance they had for you then.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: The R0 number, as that is, that's directly connected with what's known technically as the attack rate, that is that if there's a wave of infection that goes through the population how many people will be infected during that wave. It's directly connected to that.

And the case fatality rate, as it says, is a measure of how many of those people, what proportion of those people infected will die.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Then looking at the next paragraph, you say:

"If we take those numbers at face value we quickly get a ballpark estimate of almost half the people in the UK (and many other countries) getting this infection over a year or so, at least a doubling of the gross mortality rate much more during epidemic peak), and a completely overwhelmed health system."

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just focusing on that for a moment, Professor, you've used the term "ballpark estimate", we've heard about modelling and about the different types of models, whether they produced predictions or scenarios, this appears to be, if you like, a back-of-a-scrap-of-paper exercise in statistical prediction. I mean, perhaps you won't agree with that description, but there doesn't seem to be anything, put it this way, complicated about the analysis that you're undertaking there?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No, this is a very standard -- it's a very crude analysis, but I wouldn't call it back-of-the-envelope --

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right, we'll go with crude.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- it's a very, very crude analysis, and I think I say elsewhere in the email this is the sort of calculation that I would expect my undergrad class to be able to master.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Are you trying to make the point that it's something really quite clear and obvious to you at the time?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. And in the context of these emails, it's something that I fully expected would be obvious and clear to Jeremy Farrar and Neil Ferguson, which of course they confirmed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: They agreed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Then if we can just look at the next paragraph, it's there that you refer to why you are this being something that you would expect your undergraduates to do with a pocket calculator in a few minutes. But you also -- sorry, if we go down to the paragraph underneath that ...

*(Pause)*

**Lady Hallett**: Professor Woolhouse, why did you start the chain? Did you feel like you were a voice in the wilderness and therefore were seeking views from colleagues whom you respected, or did you feel that other experts in your field were thinking the same thing? Did you feel alone or ...?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No. It's a very good question.

So I fully expected my two correspondents on this to have the same interpretation of the data and the information that was emerging. As I suspect Mr O'Connor is going to discuss with me later, I was already at that stage discussing this with the Chief Medical Officer of Scotland. Basically what I -- I think I'm jumping in Mr O'Connor's evidence here.

**Lady Hallett**: I apologise to Mr O'Connor if I've jumped in.

**Mr O'Connor**: It's your evidence, Professor, not mine.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Shall I go on then?

**Mr O'Connor**: Do answer --

**Lady Hallett**: Carry on, he'll forgive me.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I think it was around about that time that I was alerting the Chief Medical Officer of Scotland to this. I did not want to do this without essentially getting my view peer reviewed. I didn't want to do that without confirmation from people I knew knew this subject that I wasn't making a huge mistake. And I got that reassurance through this correspondence.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank.

Sorry, Mr O'Connor.

**Mr O'Connor**: Not at all, not at all.

I am going indeed to take you shortly to those emails that you exchanged with the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, but before we do, let's just look at one or two more references in this document.

If we can look at the paragraph starting "What's the right response?", please, again just to understand the nature of your concern, you say:

"That's [and I take that that that is referring to your calculation based on the R0 number and the case fatality rate] not a worst case; that's based on the central estimates published by WHO."

Now, we've heard about worst-case scenarios being part of a system where one models a number of different possible outcomes and the reasonable worst-case scenario being the most pessimistic in a way, but you're saying that this is not a worst-case scenario; does that mean that it's something more confident than that or more precise than that?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No, it doesn't mean that. If you wanted a worst-case scenario you would have to do a lot more work. It's based on those numbers published by the World Health Organisation.

And again, to come back to my Lady's question, if I'm talking to the Chief Medical Officer of Scotland with this, I want to do so with some authority, and rather than -- you know, the data I would use is the data that was coming out of the World Health Organisation.

Now, I didn't necessarily agree with that data, but I used it anyway, and the reason is the critical number there is the case fatality rate, because the R0 number, as it is there, is large enough that that tells you you're going to have a very big wave. If nothing else happens to mitigate it. But you're going to have a big wave. So then it does become very, very important what the case fatality rate is. And case fatality rate for seasonal influenza, for example, seasonal influenza not pandemic influenza, would be something like 0.1%. So 4% is very, very high.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: But it's not as high as it could be and, as elsewhere in this trail, actually an even higher number comes out. So I have to say at this point I was very, very concerned.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In a nutshell, your feeling was that if these calculations, if this analysis was sound, and that's why you're checking with others, this is something that people need to start preparing for?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Absolutely.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's, if we may, look at Neil Ferguson's response, he responded within an hour or so.

We'll need to go to the page before to pick up the beginning of his response, but it's at the very bottom of the page.

He says this:

"Fully agree. Jeremy [that's Jeremy Farrar] and I were saying the same to Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty last night. I hope (and think likely) that COBRA will meet early next week."

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Now, he also says that, I don't think we need to go back to the previous page to see this, but he sent you a report at that point, did he not? He said, "I'm sending you an attached report"?

Shall we have a look --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Perhaps we do -- let's just look to be clear. He says:

"We will be releasing the attached in the next hour or [so]. It is a longer version of a report circulated", and so on.

I don't know if you recall, but the subsequent emails then do go on to be a discussion between you and Neil Ferguson about that case fatality rate and the possibility that it's actually higher?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, so we're both recognising that that is an absolutely crucial number to have, that it's very difficult to estimate it accurately in the early stages of a pandemic, this is a long-standing problem, so we have doubts and concern about it, and Neil shared those. And it was a crucial question, how high that is.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. I'm going to go on in a moment to look at the email that you then sent to Catherine Calderwood. Before I do, can we just briefly go back to that initial email exchange that you had, the earlier email exchange with Jeremy Farrar, because there was one particular email from him that I omitted to take you to and it's quite important.

So can we go back to the first page, please, of INQ000103349. Now, you'll recall a few minutes ago there was that initial email that you sent to him saying: I'm worried about this, am I right to be worried? My guess is there's a significant likelihood of it going global.

He responded, amongst other things, by sending you some internal emails that he had sent around the Wellcome Trust.

You weren't quite sure what he was in fact saying, whether he was actually agreeing with you about your prediction or not, so we see that the second email down:

"Thanks. Just to be clear. You DON'T think it will go global? Or that it will?"

So you're just wanting him to be clear?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Crystal clear, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And his response to that then is at the top:

"It will.

"It probably already has.

"So many asymptomatic, very mild infectious individuals who can transmit -- sort of worst hybrid of flu+SARS!"

Just help us, if you will, what's the significance in this context of "asymptomatic ... mild infectious" cases?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's absolutely crucial. So you'll recall the SARS outbreak of 2003 which was brought under control by a very impressive global effort led by the World Health Organisation, but the central feature of SARS that allowed that effort to be successful, was there was very little transmission in the absence of symptoms.

So if you could detect people with symptoms quickly enough, and isolate them, quarantine them, you could bring outbreaks under control.

We knew from much earlier in January, as soon as the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 had been published, that this was very closely related to SARS. Very, very closely. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses called it actually the same species; it was that close. So there was obviously a question of whether or not it would behave as SARS. But if it didn't, if there was asymptomatic transmission, then it couldn't be contained in the same way that SARS was contained. And that is why Jeremy raised the flu scenario, because a lot of flu transmission is asymptomatic, and that makes it very hard to control the same way that SARS was controlled.

So it's a technical point but it is a crucial one for the type of response that would be appropriate.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Now, you've already told us in a slightly different context that you were not getting a complete picture from the data from China at the time, and you refer, in your emails, to needing more data. But what we do see here, at the very least, is that there is a discussion about asymptomatic cases as early as the end of January 2020?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. And for the reason I gave, that it's crucial.

There's another reason it's crucial, actually; may I raise that?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: We talked about the importance of the case fatality rate being 4%, but that's a ratio. So it's the number of deaths -- which was being recorded in China, we didn't know at the time how accurately, but it was a number -- divided by the number of infections. Well, that is a much more difficult number to estimate, and if there was significant asymptomatic transmission then that number could actually be quite large. The consequence is that 4% figure would come down quite considerably, and in the end, as I think you probably know, it came down to about 1%.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: But at this stage, because we didn't know whether there were these asymptomatic cases, we couldn't make that judgement with --

**Counsel Inquiry**: That's what I wanted to press you on a little.

So you've explained why, in a situation like this, the possibility of asymptomatic cases is so important, but what Jeremy Farrar seems to be saying is that there are asymptomatic cases. Was that something that you were confident about at the time or suspected or simply didn't know?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I was not confident about it at the time. I simply didn't know.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right. Thank you. As I say, I just wanted to go back to that email.

You'll recall we were looking at emails between you and Neil Ferguson and Jeremy Farrar a few days later, and you then went on, as we will see, to send an email to Catherine Calderwood on the same day, and I'd like to look at that now, please.

That is INQ000103352. Thank you.

I think it may be the third page that we need. Yes, in fact it's the very bottom -- sorry, could we go to the third page. It's the email that starts at the bottom of this page.

You had been in touch with her before, had you not?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I first got in touch with her I believe on 21 January --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- very shortly after speaking to Jeremy.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But this one is on Saturday, the 25th, so it's -- and it's shortly after those emails you exchanged with Jeremy Farrar and Neil Ferguson?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, but, as I say, it's the second.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But that's why there is a sort of existing email chain?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And you're referring back to an email at the very beginning, but you say there:

"Forgive me bothering you on a weekend ..."

Is that a significant comment? You could have waited until the Monday, but the suggestion is you thought it was too important to wait.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can we move on to the next page, please. What we see here, Professor, I'm not going to take you through it line by line, but it's a very similar message to the message you had been, as it were, testing out on Neil Ferguson and Jeremy Farrar.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It is.

**Counsel Inquiry**: One small difference, if we can see, about ten lines down, after you've referred to the R0 rate of 2 and the case fatality rate of 4, again you talk about putting those numbers into a model, but here you talk about the effect of that being that "the gross mortality rate [would] triple", whereas when you had been speaking to Neil Ferguson and Jeremy Farrar earlier you were talking about it more than doubling, I think were the words you used there. Is that because of the subsequent discussion you'd had about the case fatality rate or can you not help us with that now?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yeah, it's ... there's an element of judgement going on here. The -- you call them "back-of-the-envelope calculations", they are quite sophisticated, but they don't incorporate all the detail that you would need to actually make those estimates rigorous. So there's some element of judgement. I used my judgement in trying to come to something sensible to communicate to a Chief Medical Officer who is not --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- expert in this area. Judgement, but consistent with the data that I had.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And you are sending her an important message?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: What were you hoping or expecting that she would do in response?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I wasn't actually certain, not knowing the Chief Medical Officer of Scotland that well at the time. I'd only met her very, very briefly. What I hoped to do was that Scotland would start to think about pandemic preparedness immediately, and I had not, from my own contacts within Scotland, at the time got any impression that they were. So I was very anxious to hurry the process along.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's just look, go back, please, so we can see her response. We see it's just a one line response. She thanks you. This is on the same day. She says she has shared it with her CMO/DCMO colleagues.

Now, we can see it's copied to Gregor Smith, who I think was the Deputy Chief Medical Officer?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: He was at the time, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can you help us whether Catherine Calderwood might be talking about sharing it with other CMOs throughout the UK, for example Chris Whitty, or are you unable to tell us what that email means?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I didn't take it that way, but of course I was aware from the correspondence we were discussing earlier that Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty had been alerted to this, if they weren't alerted to it already, by Jeremy Farrar and Neil Ferguson.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

But in any event, she says she is going to discuss it at a meeting on Monday. Is that a meeting that you were supposed to be going to --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- or not?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So how did that strike you as a response?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, that's just a holding response. I think I sent her another briefing very shortly afterwards, as more information became available. I wasn't waiting for a detailed response to provide updates. This -- I was cold calling the CMO Scotland on this one and I continued to do so.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Well, as you say, you did send another, in fact on the next day, so the Sunday.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yep.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We'll need to go to the next page forward of the document. No, it's page 2 -- sorry, I meant it's page 2, because it's an email chain so we're working backwards. Thank you. In fact, that may have been the one you went to before, I'm sorry.

So we see here the email you sent back on the Sunday. You say that you're extending your briefing, and you say that the advice you're giving her is closely aligned to the advice that Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance have received from Jeremy Farrar and Neil Ferguson. Presumably you said that on the strength of what they had told you in those emails?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You talk about there being "three scenarios in play". I just want to ask you briefly about them, each of them.

"First, there is containment of any introductions/outbreaks within Scotland/UK."

But you go on to say that that is a strategy that depends on all countries, as it were, containing the virus within their borders.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. So this is essentially the -- would be a replay of the SARS epidemic in 2003, where it is possible to contain the virus, wherever it gets around the world, but without it getting into the community and causing a pandemic.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, and then the second possibility or the second scenario is what you describe as the "not-much-worse-than-a-bad-flu-season scenario", and I think, drawing on what you've already told us this morning, Professor, that possibility revolves around the chance that the severity of the infection is actually much, much less than was being understood at the time, and because the -- if there had been more mild and asymptomatic cases, then it would have been a less serious event when it reached the UK.

Is that what you're trying to describe here?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, partly that. That's important, what you just said, but the other one is that if there was a lot of asymptomatic transmission, as I said earlier, it was unlikely you would be able to contain this in the way that the SARS epidemic was contained, so you would have to have a more flu-like response.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Then the third scenario, which you describe as the scenario that was "outlined ... yesterday", so the emails we've seen, that's the SARS scenario?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

So we see here, do we, it would be wrong to read your earlier emails as suggesting that there is only one course that this developing situation can take, you're here outlining three different possibilities?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, in the earlier emails I was acting, as I said before, directly on the data coming out of the World Health Organisation, which seems to me to be a good starting point for a discussion of this kind.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Can we now, just to finish this off, go back to the first page of the email chain, which is obviously the last email, which is sent a bit less than a week later, so on Friday, 31 January, at the very end of the month. You're updating Catherine Calderwood with some further data, some further information, and you describe it as "not much good news". You refer to the two parameters being the basic reproduction number and the generation time.

"Estimates of the former [that's the reproduction number] are higher than before and estimates of the latter are slightly lower than had been assumed."

And as you say:

"This means that any epidemic will be bigger and faster than we were anticipating a week [before]."

You also, and this is the second point you make, say:

"... there is now some evidence of transmission from cases before symptoms are apparent."

So this is the asymptomatic transmission that Jeremy Farrar had mentioned in that email a couple of weeks beforehand?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But now you're saying that there is some evidence of it. Can you help us with what evidence was available of asymptomatic transmission at the time or how confident you were in that evidence? In fact, you do go on to talk about it.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, it's low quality, I think I'm referring to the report you said earlier from Neil Ferguson, so he will be able to give you chapter and verse when you speak to it, but it is, as I said earlier, very difficult to get reliable estimates of extent of asymptomatic transmission this early on, but I believe Neil thought there was some evidence that this was occurring.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Certainly, I mean, is this fair, there was enough evidence of asymptomatic transmission at that time for it to be a factor that was important to bear in mind?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: To bear in mind, yes, as I quite clearly say. The evidence I thought was low quality, but a factor to bear in mind, as you say.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Then if we can go down a little bit below what's -- thank you. Just to summarise, you reached the point of saying:

"As we stand, however, the epidemiological indicators make the potential epidemic in Scotland of the same order as the Reasonable Worst Case for pandemic influenza used for planning purposes, and perhaps even more severe than that scenario. In which case our preparedness will be tested to the very limit. There has not yet been, to my knowledge, any formal modelling of the burden on health care systems, but the consensus seems to be that we could be completely overwhelmed (including any surge capacity) within 2-3 months of the epidemic taking off."

Then you say this:

"As always, I must stress that this is NOT a prediction. But it is a possibility that cannot be excluded ..."

I just want to ask you, in that earlier email about a week beforehand you had said it's not a scenario but it is what the data were telling you. Here you use slightly different language, you say it's not a prediction but it's a possibility that cannot be excluded.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I believe in the first email you referred to I was saying this is not a worst-case scenario.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Which was correct, because the data were still consistent with a higher R0, a higher attack rate and a higher case fatality rate, so I wasn't giving them a reasonable -- I wasn't giving the CMO Scotland a reasonable worst-case scenario. But I never at any point, and I was very careful to do this, in my communications with her or any other officials, said I was predicting anything. My line on this is I can't be 100% confident, or even anywhere near it, of what will happen, but I can be 100% confident that government should be paying attention to this.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Right. Of course, the amount of attention that's paid to a problem like this does depend, we may hear, to some extent, on how likely people think it is that it's going to happen. Is that something that you could engage with at all, or could you simply say, "Look, it's a possibility, you need to look at it"?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's what I said. I said, "This is a real possibility and you need to look to it."

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, you've used a qualifying word immediately there by saying it's a "real possibility"?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I was trying to emphasise it, not knock it down.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, this is definitely a real possibility. This is something we should be preparing for.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And we've looked at these emails in a little detail now and one can be left in really no doubt that you were expressing your concern about the developing picture?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. I was very, very concerned at that point. The worst-case scenarios were really frightening.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I want to move to another document, with that discussion in mind. It's minutes of a COBR meeting.

If we can move to INQ000056226, please. Of course this was a meeting that took place in London. You weren't there. The date, we see from the top, is 29 January, so it's very much around the same time as these emails we have been looking at. In fact it's between that weekend where you contacted Catherine Calderwood and the Friday, the 31st, when you sent the email we've just been looking at.

We can see from the front page it was chaired by Matt Hancock, and if we can go on to page 5, please, which I think is where the substantive minutes ... yes. I want to ask you about two different passages.

Paragraph 2 records the contribution made to the meeting by Patrick Vallance, the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, and he, amongst other things, says that there was "limited evidence of asymptomatic transmission".

Perhaps that's really just encapsulating the same point that you were making around the same time: some evidence but not necessarily very good evidence of that.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's how I would read it, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Then if we may we'll look at paragraphs 3 and 4. Here we move to Chris Whitty, the CMO. First of all, he says that:

"... the UK planning assumptions were based on the reasonable worst case scenario. There were two scenarios to be considered. The first was that the spread was confined within China ..."

So just pausing there, that's similar to, is it not, the first of those three scenarios that you defined? It's not quite the same, because your first scenario anticipated the virus escaping China, but then being contained within the countries that it reached. But it's a limited scenario where the virus is contained; is that fair?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, obviously I don't know what was intended by this. Just because this virus, this new disease would turn out to be like SARS would be absolutely no reason for complacency. So I'm not sure -- if that's -- the spread was confined within China, I thought that was unlikely -- I think that's unlikely, at the time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's go on to the second of the two scenarios. He says that the second is that the spread is not limited to China and there would be a pandemic-like scenario, with the UK impacted. The second scenario was plausible but it may take weeks to months. Then this:

"The CMO said that the Reasonable Worst Case Scenario ... was similar to the [Reasonable Worst Case Scenario] for pandemic influenza."

And he said:

"That there was a 10 per cent likelihood of [that] happening but that this figure had not been agreed by SAGE."

How are we to understand, what's your reaction to what Chris Whitty is recorded as having said there in paragraph 4?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I don't know where the 10% figure comes from, and I don't actually know where he gets the data precisely for the reasonable worst-case scenario. I, in my communications that we've already gone over, I was concerned this would be worse than pandemic influenza, and I remember continuing to express those concerns over many weeks subsequently -- many weeks, in SPI-M-O meetings and others -- that the reasonable worst-case scenario for pandemic influenza was not adequate for the actual crisis that we were about to face.

So I never agreed with using pandemic influenza as a reasonable worst-case scenario. Now, I said it could be influenza-like, but that was not the worst case.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. As far as the 10%, you've already told us that you would not be inclined to give that sort of risk or you would not be inclined to put a number on it. So, I mean, is your position just that, that you wouldn't engage with giving a likelihood of that nature, or can you say whether you think that that 10% estimation is too high or too low?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I wouldn't want to comment on the 10% figure, I don't know where it comes from, but I actually repeat what I said to you earlier, which is that I may or may not be 10% confident about the reasonable worst case happening, but I'm 100% confident the government should be paying attention.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just to a lay reader, Professor, and it may be that we can't take this any further, but to a lay reader of your emails, it does -- even if it's just the fact that you're bothering the Scottish CMO on a Saturday and the persistence and so on, the impression that comes across is that this was rather more than a 10% risk that you were concerned about. But they're your emails.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, he's asking about the 10% risk of the reasonable worst case happening. So, for the reasons we've discussed, the uncertainty in some of the key numbers, it is difficult to put a range of possibilities on it. But if you thought I thought a pandemic, not a reasonable worst case but a pandemic, was 10% likely, I would say it was far more likely than that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: But I did not put numbers at the time, so forgive me if I don't put numbers on it now.

**Counsel Inquiry**: That's understood. You, looking further ahead, then, Professor -- thank you, we can take that down -- as you said, you continued to engage with Ms Calderwood and her deputy, we're not going to go to all of the emails, but you carried on engaging with them, and as we will see you attended SPI-M-O meetings going through February and into March.

In summary, using these early concerns as a sort of starting point, what's your reflection on the response that then followed to the fear of a pandemic?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, I think the first thing to say is that the pandemic that unfolded, terrible that it was, was not as bad as my own personal reasonable worst case that I was worried about in the darkest days of early -- rather, late January. And, as I say, I was very, very concerned. So it didn't turn out to be that -- it certainly turned out to be bad enough, but it didn't turn out to be as bad as the worst case that I personally was fearing.

Are you asking about the whole -- the weeks after that? Because I can summarise that --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do summarise. I am going to take you in a little detail to some of the meetings, but I think it would be helpful if you were just to summarise in general terms.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I am in complete agreement, not only for the UK but for the world, with the report of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, which reviewed the World Health Organisation's pandemic response, and it used the phrase in its report "lost February", which is referring to February 2020, and they are concerned that simply -- not just in the UK, but globally -- not enough was done in terms of pandemic response. And I think that is as true of the UK as it was so many other countries in the world.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

You, in your statement, use a term "lack of urgency" during that period, which is obviously expressing a very similar sentiment, and you suggest a number of possible causes for that, which I want to ask you about briefly.

First of all, can we look, please, at your statement, page 19, paragraph 105. You say this, you share the concern expressed in a Reuters article. I'm not going to ask you to look at the article, but the concern is that:

"... the minutes of meetings of SAGE and its subcommittees did not communicate the seriousness and urgency of the situation as it developed in January and February ..."

Can you expand on that point a little for us?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. So I knew, of course, that both Jeremy Farrar and Neil Ferguson were on SAGE, we've already established that they were as concerned as I was about what was unfolding, but having seen the minutes of SAGE I didn't feel that that was reflected. So I knew some SAGE members were very concerned, but the minutes didn't seem to me to capture that concern.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I don't know whether you were following the Inquiry, Professor, but we looked with Professor Medley at some of the SAGE minutes during February in the context of the possibility of the NHS being overwhelmed. He said in his statement that he and others on SAGE had formed the view during February, I'm paraphrasing, that it was likely that the NHS would be overwhelmed. But that didn't seem to be reflected in the minutes.

Is that the sort of practical example that you would give of the minutes not conveying the seriousness of the situation?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, I think I'd point you to my earlier evidence in the sequence of emails you discussed with me, with Catherine Calderwood, where I pointed to that possibility in January 20-something, in mid to late January I was pointing at the possibility of the health system being overwhelmed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: From your evidence that you can give us, of course you weren't on SAGE, but you were present at the SPI-M-O meetings.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Was this possibility of overwhelm of the NHS something that was discussed during those SPI-M-O meetings?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I did watch your session with Graham Medley, and as I -- what I understood him saying for that was the evidence hardened up over the month of February. And I completely agree with that.

As you quite rightly said, you know, one -- or implied, one email from someone like myself using what you called a back-of-the-envelope calculation is not enough evidence to say the NHS is going to be overwhelmed. I'm warning of the possibility but I'm not saying it's going to happen. A lot of -- I beg your pardon. A lot of the -- a lot of the things I was discussing in January, all the ones we've discussed today, the evidence firmed up over the period of February.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

Then if we can look over the page, please, we could go to paragraph 107, you say you also believed:

"... there was some complacency regarding the UK's pandemic response planning. The problem was that this planning was undertaken with an influenza pandemic in mind. Covid-19 wasn't flu and required an even more vigorous response."

And so on.

Help us with that. Why was that a possible cause of that lost month, as you describe it, in February?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, I don't know if it was a cause of it, but I do recall very clearly there was a lot of discussion about the reasonable worst-case scenario in the SPI-M-O meetings of February 2020, and I'm quite clear that I repeatedly said that I didn't think it was bad enough, that reasonable worst-case scenario. And certainly that it was different.

And I gave this evidence to Module 1, that the way you respond to a pandemic, an influenza pandemic, and the way you would respond to a SARS-like pandemic are different. I gave a lot of evidence on that to Module 1. And I was worried that this wasn't fully being captured in keeping hold of the reasonable worst-case scenario for pandemic influenza for so long.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just one more of these points, if we can go to the next paragraph, please, and you refer at the top of the page to "optimism bias", and it may be that this is linked with this point, which is to do with the influence of the swine flu pandemic in 2009. Is that a fair way of putting it?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, that's one possible cause of it, but yes, it is.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You make the point here that, as it were, the swine flu pandemic in 2009 had not been as bad as at one point it was feared it would be. Is what you're saying here that that experience impacted on the way people thought about this pandemic in February 2020?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, that's my fear. As I said, I'm concerned about it. It impacted on me too, because the root cause of the -- or one of the main causes of the overestimation of the threat of swine flu was that the early estimates of the case fatality rate, that we were discussing earlier, were way too high. Way too high. And I knew that, from back in 2009, so I was naturally concerned that the same thing was happening again, that we would be exaggerating the scale of the threat, which is why I kept going on -- this emphasis on we need to know what this case fatality rate is, to know if we're really facing a threat.

But I do think that what happened in 2009 was likely to make people suspect the scientists were just crying wolf again, you know, as they did ten years earlier.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I want to move on, Professor, and, as it were, move the story forward. You've referred to February as being the "lost month", which implies that things that should have happened during that month didn't happen, and I want to ask you about what it is you think should have been done during that month, and one of the phrases that we have heard and we will continue to hear is the idea of going early, going hard. That's something that Patrick Vallance talks about in his witness statement. We heard it from Professor Hale, I think it was.

You, in your statement, suggest a rather different approach. I'm not going to go to it, but you say a better maxim is that earlier action can be less drastic action.

Can you tell us what you mean by that, and perhaps with particular reference to that month of February 2020?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I think the significance of that goes well beyond February 2020, it goes throughout the pandemic. And I think it's a really important distinction. I think it's one that sets the tone for the whole approach to the pandemic response in the UK.

So this idea, and as I remember Patrick and others repeated it several times, go hard, go early, and go wider than you would -- in fact, I think that was the phrase: go harder than you want to, earlier than you want to, wider than you want to.

Now, that, for me, is a good maxim in a particular situation where your strategic objective is to eradicate the virus. You're going to try and clear it out completely. That's what was done with SARS in 2003, and there I would hold on to that as a good maxim.

My -- mine was different. I did not think, from very early on, that eradicating the virus was even the remotest possibility. I'm not going to say 100%, I will never say that, but I was pretty convinced that was not going to be the case. In which case, this go hard, go early, go wide is going to mean severe restrictions of some kind, it's going to -- your intervention is going to be very disruptive. So I was always interested, from early on, in trying to find a sustainable intervention. And so my maxim is: if you go early, you don't have to go so hard. And I think there's a very big difference between those approaches. And the UK went down the first approach, in the end, it went down the go hard. I wanted to go early. And there's a difference.

**Counsel Inquiry**: There are perhaps at least two reasons why going early and not going so hard might be a better route to adopt, and I want to just explore with you whether you have in mind both of these reasons or only one of them.

One is that it's a more effective way of controlling the virus. The other -- and appreciating what you say about the aim being controlling rather than eliminating -- is that it is a course which minimises the other impacts that are felt by society from NPIs, the most obvious one being lockdown. I know that certainly the second argument is one that you've made.

Do you think that it's actually also a better -- simply a better way of keeping the numbers down, or are you really only relying on the fact that it has a reduced collateral impact on the population?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: A better way of keeping the numbers down. I think we'll probably come on to that. So if your response is to keep the numbers down as low as you possibly can, then yes, you go hard, you go early, you go wide, and what that essentially means, in almost caricature, but we will come on to it perhaps, is you lock down, you do something as drastic as that very, very early on and you stay there, and that's the way to minimise the actual numbers of cases.

Now, that was not something that was being talked about, an indefinite lockdown, at any stage. And since we're on this subject, for the record, no country in the world went for an indefinite lockdown. Everyone realised that, you know, lockdown wasn't going to be a sustainable measure. And given that, my emphasis was on sustainability. And I said a little while ago to you that I was convinced that it wasn't going to be a transient phenomenon, that this virus was going to be with us for a long time, and there was work done in America actually on modelling the long-term dynamics of this pandemic as early as, I think, February, but certainly March 2020, published papers showing that it would go into an endemic virus, that it would actually eventually become a seasonal infection.

So scientists were thinking about this long term, that we were in this for years, as early as that, and therefore my thinking, starting then, was that whatever we did it had to be sustainable. And we come back to this, going harder than you want, earlier than you want, wider than you want is not sustainable. So that's my -- I had a different view of how we should be handling this.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Many of those themes, or some of them anyway, emerge in an email exchange I want to ask you about. This is an exchange between you and Professor Edmunds, in the days before the decision was taken to impose the first lockdown.

So if we can go, please, to INQ000103343. Now, to set the context, Professor, there was a paper, was there not, by Professor Steven Riley in, I think it was 10 March, which went to SPI-M-O and which initiated a discussion about moving to a complete lockdown? Professor Riley is coming to give evidence tomorrow so I don't want to get into the detail of that paper, but I think it's right that that paper provides the context for this exchange between you and Professor Edmunds?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, and the paper was an important element of a discussion that was going on in SPI-M-O anyway at that time, but the paper was important, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So with that in mind, could we -- I think we'll need to go to the next page, please. Yes.

So the email I want to start with is the one at the very bottom of this page, and we'll have to go on to the next page. So you are emailing John Edmunds quite late at night on Wednesday, 11 March. First of all you say this:

"We were given the policy objective of flattening the peak."

We've heard of course about that, with Professor Medley and others. You say that you have modelled it, and then you also say that you've "described [the policy] to the policy makers here" -- "here", does that mean in Scotland?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: "... as possible, but it would be good fortune as much as anything."

I'll ask you about that in a minute. Let's read on to see what you say in the next line. You say:

"[You] also told them that the most likely outcomes are either that we'll see a peak that the NHS couldn't cope with, or we'll end up in the grip of severe BSIs with no way out."

BSIs, does that stand for behavioural social intervention?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. I mean, that's gone out of fashion --

**Counsel Inquiry**: We see different --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- that particular acronym, so non-pharmaceutical interventions, but particularly social distancing.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. So starting from the fact -- you see, you're describing the policy as being trying to "flatten the peak", and it appears you're saying that your view during February and running up to early March was that that might work but that you thought it was more likely that it wouldn't, because you would either end up with a pandemic that overwhelmed the NHS or you would be forced, presumably for that reason, into having very severe lockdown?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So that's right. In other communications I think I put that much more strongly, that trying to walk this delicate balancing act of keeping the epidemic roughly the same size without either falling into severe restrictions or, worse, having a big epidemic was ... well, it would be luck more than anything. I didn't think we could manage the pandemic well enough. And I was actually quite concerned about this. There seemed to be an idea that somehow we could manage the epidemic curve, and another analogy I used -- I fear it might not be in my evidence, so I apologise -- was directing a jet of water from a hosepipe but holding the thing 2 feet from the end. I mean, you can't manage the course of a pandemic with any kind of -- that kind of precision. So I was very concerned about any policy that said it had to follow a very narrow path to be successful, I did not think that was viable, and I expressed it much more forcefully in other communications than I did in this one.

**Counsel Inquiry**: That's actually why I wanted to pick you up on that word, your use of the word "possible", because, as you say, other people have expressed the view that it was never going to work, at least in this email you seem to be giving the view that it might have worked but that you didn't think it was likely. But perhaps what you're telling us is this email doesn't fully represent your views at the time?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, again, you've got the whole body of my emails at that time, so you can suggest that. But yes, I mean, we're holding the hosepipe 2 feet from the end, we might hit the target but it's not something to guarantee.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's look, if we may, at Professor Edmunds's response. He says:

"You can't have a lockdown for months, let alone the years that Steve ..."

That's Steven Riley, isn't it?

"... is suggesting? However, I agree there may actually be pressure for a lockdown. And they will work, temporarily."

So that's the view he was taking.

Can I then ask you about the email that you then sent in response to him. You say:

"What I was trying to say is that I think we are likely to end up with your scenario by default."

So that was Professor Edmunds's scenario. What was he campaigning or arguing for at the time?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So he was arguing for a response that involved on/off lockdowns. And actually, of course, that's, as I --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- said here -- what I'm trying to say is "I think we'll end up in your scenario by default", and that is what we ended up with: we ended up with on/off lockdowns. So that's what I was communicating there.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Then the next line:

"Neil's [Neil Ferguson] won't be allowed once they realise the toll on the NHS."

Is that because Neil Ferguson at the time was arguing or was continuing to argue for, as it were, a flattening the peak type approach?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I'm going to have to apologise to you here, because, having seen that you wanted to talk about this, I went back to try to work out for myself what I was referring to, and I can't categorically identify it, I'm afraid, as to what I was referring to there. So --

**Counsel Inquiry**: If you can't --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I'm sorry about that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No, that's fine.

That, in any event, was a discussion that you had with Professor Edmunds during that week, and as we will see there were important meetings that took place towards the end of that -- that week and then over the weekend, which set the course towards the lockdown.

If we can look at, please, going back to your statement, page 29, paragraph 160, it's right, isn't it, Professor, that you did support the idea of that lockdown at the time when, in the end, the decision had to be made whether it should be imposed or not?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That was at March 23rd, and I did, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. So paragraph 160 you say:

"For [you], the key driver of that recommendation was not model outputs, it was data on the rapid doubling times of hospitalisations and deaths ..."

Is it a fair summary that, given the position the country was in at that time, you took the view that that was really either the only course or the best course to take?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, I didn't -- didn't think there was any other option on the table on that date.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You go on, in your statement, though, Professor, to express the view that although this wasn't known at the time, with hindsight and in particular with access to mobility data that has become available since, you wonder whether in fact that lockdown was necessary. Could you expand a little on that point for us?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. Do you want me to explain what the mobility data --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, please.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- are?

So Google, which is the one that was using -- anonymously can track movements, not of individuals, but of its whole population of phones, and it was making those data -- it made those data available later on in the pandemic.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Professor, sorry, can I just ask you to try to keep your voice -- or keep reasonably slow, please.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Sorry, I beg your pardon.

They made those data available, and they give information on where people are by quite broad categories. So are they in residential areas, are they in city centres, are they in transit, so -- and those data were used quite widely, when they became available, by ourselves for some of our research on the topic and many other groups. And what the data from Google clearly show in the week leading up to the lockdown on March 23rd was that the amount of time people in the UK were spending outside residential areas, so presumably where they lived, had fallen off a cliff, in the week before lockdown. And when lockdown was introduced, it didn't actually fall any further.

Now, that's not to say there weren't lots of other things going on that might have influenced the spread of the virus, but based on that particular data stream the job was already done.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The inference you draw in your statement is that what had caused or probably caused that reduction in population movement was the, as it were, milder NPIs that had been introduced in the week or two before the lockdown?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Two things. So one of them is that. So the whole raft of measures, quite severe restrictions, had been introduced up to that time, but we didn't have sight of how effective they'd been. We couldn't even see how they'd changed people's behaviour, which is the earliest indicator of those being effective. So we'd introduced them, but we hadn't given ourselves time to see if they worked, which is one of the reasons why I keep saying earlier action can be less drastic action. If we'd done them earlier we could have waited to see if they'd worked. But we didn't, so we couldn't wait for that. So that's the --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: When did you get access to the Google data?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: My Lady, I'm not sure.

**Lady Hallett**: Roughly.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It was some time after. It wasn't even -- I don't think it was very quickly after.

Later on in the pandemic there was an even better, more purpose-built data source, which was called CoMix, a survey of people's actual behaviours, which was incredibly valuable information. But CoMix, like so many of our key data gathering structures that were set up during the pandemic, wasn't available in those crucial months up to the time of lockdown, so we couldn't see how people were behaving because we weren't surveying it. So the best we can do is look at the Google mobility data.

**Lady Hallett**: Are we talking about 2020 with the Google data?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. Oh, yes, it was made available in 2020, but I can't right now recall when.

**Mr O'Connor**: My Lady, I'm about to move to another topic. Is that a convenient moment?

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, of course. We will break now and I shall return at 11.55.

*(11.40 am)*

*(A short break)*

*(11.55 am)*

**Lady Hallett**: Mr O'Connor.

**Mr O'Connor**: Professor, before we had our break, we were debating the issue of the decline in population movement, which you had said was apparent in the mobility data which became available after, some time after, the first lockdown, and what may have caused that decline in movement.

We, I think, covered the topic of the earlier NPIs, the less extreme NPIs, which might have contributed. I think there was another half to your answer which you were going to come to. Perhaps you could come to that now.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, the other very real possibility during that period, the days or the week up to lockdown, was that people were changing their behaviour anyway; they weren't waiting for the government to announce a lockdown but they were taking precautions and changing their behaviour, changing their habits accordingly. And I think there is very likely to be some truth in that view, all the way through the pandemic, once we did have the better data that I was describing to my Lady earlier, it was clear that quite often the public was anticipating what the government would do and they were responding perhaps not purely to government directives or government regulations and rules about what we could and couldn't do, but they were making decisions for themselves.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: And I came to the view, over the course of 2020, that this actually was a very important driver of what we were seeing. And we might come to this point, but if you tried to understand that simply on the basis that it was government rules and regulations that were changing people's behaviour, you were probably getting it wrong, that the public was making their own decisions.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No doubt, Professor, one can take from what you've just been telling us that if one looks ahead to the next pandemic, the absolute need for as much of this mobility type data in as real time as possible is something that must be aspired to?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Absolutely. And for a very particular reason. So the influenza models were actually quite well informed by real data on people's movements, but obviously before a pandemic. And what we're now asking ourselves to do is make a -- how are people going to behave in the face of what was actually a once-in-a-lifetime -- we hope -- crisis? And there is no sound basis for predicting that. Behavioural science, I learnt over the course of that year, is not a predictive science. And predicting how people are going to respond was very difficult. And that made all predictions, by whatever means, very, very difficult, because you have to work out how -- not just people, how are people going to behave, businesses, institutions, every element of society, what's it going to do in response to this crisis?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Lastly on this, Professor, I think what you've said is that this data, which you found out about later, has caused you to reflect on whether in fact that lockdown really needed to be imposed when it was, because of the change in movement that was seen. Are you able to go further and offer any view as to whether, in fact, had that lockdown not been imposed then, it might never have been needed or it might have been needed to have been imposed later, or is that simply too complicated, too counterfactual a matter for you to express a view on?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, as I said, I didn't think it was avoidable at the time. There have been a number of retrospective studies on the impact of lockdown. Some of them -- we may come to this -- are -- the conclusions are very clear, they thought lockdown was critical and essential, but there are others in the scientific literature that said that it wasn't, that what we would call the marginal effect of the very severe end of lockdown, particularly the instruction to stay at home, all around the world, not just in the UK, was actually quite small.

But that doesn't mean you don't have to do all the other things. So it's not as if there aren't restrictions in place, whether they're imposed or self-imposed on us, but the very -- the legal requirement to stay at home, I haven't seen any good analysis that said that actually was the killer punch, the thing that was really needed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I want to move on, Professor, and, as it were, survey the remaining period of the pandemic, which of course is most of it, and there are perhaps two themes in your statement about that period.

One, which you've just referred to I think, is the idea that lockdown is a harmful measure which should be avoided if possible; and the other, which is related, is the whole idea of segmentation, which is a policy you proposed sort of during 2020.

As far as lockdown is concerned, you've just referred to it as being, as it were, at the outer edge of NPIs. If we could look in your statement, please, at page 31, paragraph 169, you put it a little more strongly. You say:

"... I think it is fair to describe lockdown not as a public health policy but as a failure of public health policy; lockdown is what you do when you have failed to control the epidemic in other, more sustainable ways."

Is it with a sense of, as it were, a disproportionality of lockdown; is that what you're trying to get at there?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No. I want to be very, very clear at this -- about this. So there is a view that if we were more -- if we weren't so keen to go into lockdown, that it would increase the death toll. And that is a genuine concern and it's the last thing anyone would want to see, including me. So that's not the question. And the debate often got phrased in that: you either want a lockdown or you don't, and if you don't you're prepared for more people to die. And I can't tell you how distressing it is to hear that argument, and I was presented with it many times.

May I give a bit more context?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So actually Tom Whipple, The Times science editor, wrote a review of a book I wrote about the pandemic, and he was discussing this very point, and he put it beautifully, he said: at that phase of the pandemic, supporting lockdown became a test of virtue. And I completely agree that. It was very, very difficult to say that you didn't support lockdown.

So every time, without exception, I am recommending less lockdown, I am balancing that with saying what we could have done instead. The options are not lockdown or no lockdown. The options are lockdown or a whole raft of other public health interventions that would achieve the same effect as lockdown. And if they didn't, I would never support or recommend them.

So that's why I think lock -- I just call lockdown not as a public health policy but a failure of public health policy. It's what you do when all those other things you know you can do haven't worked. It's a last resort. And it should always be that, in my view.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you, Professor, that's very clear.

One of or perhaps a group of those lesser measures that you describe, which you proposed during the pandemic, we can classify as a segmentation policy. It seems to have been described by various different tags along the way, segmentation and protecting, or people talk about cocooning, let's not get hung up on the names.

Are you able, Professor, to summarise for us what that policy that you proposed was and what you were hoping that it would achieve?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I can, but I need to give you a context again.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So what I just said relates partly to segmentation and shielding, but again I want to be very, very clear on this, that I was always of the view that it was necessary to reduce the transmission rate of this virus as part of the control measures. What I'm disagreeing with is the mechanism by which we did that. So there's a lot of interventions, to do with Covid safety measures, to do with testing, to do with quarantine -- to quarantine you have to do the case finding -- sorry, there's a whole raft of measures that would reduce the transmission rate. And these were looked into, and they might not be enough.

The segmentation and shielding is another layer. So hopefully we've suppressed the number of cases. But it's a tremendously important other layer that, in my view, I think we lost sight of during the pandemic, and I think it's very -- it's a tragedy that we did, and it's this: that we knew from very early on in the pandemic that there was a relatively small subset of the population that were at tremendously enhanced risk, tremendously enhanced, and these, put it in lay terms, were the elderly, the infirm and the frail. They were at far more risk from this virus. And a statistic that sums it up is that someone over 75 was at 10,000 times more likely to die of a Covid-19 infection than a 15-year old. 10,000 times. This is a massive difference.

I could go further in characterising this, and I think you heard evidence on this point, the average age of a Covid death is older than -- was older then -- than the average age of death.

Now, that to me is a definition of mainly, definitely not exclusively, but mainly a disease of old age. There's a couple of other conditions that have that characteristic, dementia is one, that's really concentrated in the elderly, but Covid is like that. And that's very unusual for infectious disease. And actually I can only think of one other example that behaved that way and that was SARS, the close relative.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So what was it, in summary, Professor, that you proposed --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Sorry.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- what were the measures that you proposed should be adopted?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I'm going ... but the point I want to make is that it was always, in my view, tremendously important that whatever else we did we protect those vulnerable people. This is a virus that's really targeting a subset, so we need ...

So the measures we proposed went well beyond shielding. So this was recognised. It wasn't that this was unknown, but the measures that the governmental in the UK put in were shielding. And that became to be seen as enforced self-isolation by the elderly. It was very unpopular and very, very difficult to manage, for people to manage it, so that turned out not to be a very successful policy.

So we decided that we needed to go further and we identified that many of these people cannot actually reduce their contacts to zero, because they need care, they need healthcare, they need social care, they need informal care. So how do we protect them best? By protecting their carers. The people they need to -- must come in contact with must also be virus-free. So that -- and that's called cocooning, where you protect the people around the people you're trying to protect. And that policy was something that we developed over the coming --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, please, and I'd like to ask you some questions. As you say, you drafted with others a series of papers over the sort of spring and summer of 2020?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I want though to take us, as it were, to the end of the story, where these matters discussed at a SAGE meeting.

So for these purposes can we have, please, INQ000061570.

Perhaps if we can go to page 3, we will see the section headed "Segmentation" starting -- yes.

Perhaps I should have asked you, Professor, I'm sure you're aware of this meeting, but were you at it? Because of course you weren't a regular member of SAGE, and in fact I think you've told us you didn't go to any SAGE meetings, so presumably you weren't there at this one?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I was not there at this one, no.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We see that SAGE endorsed the paper on age and risk-structured segmentation. Looking down at paragraph 19, there is a reference to:

"SAGE [having] previously advised that segmentation by age is not without considerable risk, is operationally difficult, and is unlikely to be successful in reducing mortality and morbidity. However, taking additional precautions in those at increased risk is important."

If we can go over the page, please, these I think then -- the minutes really come to the core reasons why this segmentation policy was not taken forward.

First of all, it says it:

"... would be unlikely to prevent potential spillover from younger to older populations. Even if segmentation were initially achieved and high levels of immunity could be reached in younger age groups (the duration of which would be unknown), its almost certain that a further wave of the epidemic in older people would occur once segmentation ended."

Secondly:

"An unconstrained epidemic in younger age groups would also have the potential to overwhelm the NHS", and so on.

Can I just take those in reverse order. One of the concerns, then, is that that part of the population that weren't segmented would still suffer from Covid with the risk to the NHS, and there's an additional problem here, is there not, with Long Covid being a long-term sequelae which, as we know, were being experienced by people of all ages, certainly not just the old, and that sort of group of problems were certainly one of the things that were considered by SAGE. Did you consider those to be sound objections to your policy or not?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I'm not even sure that they were speaking about our policy in these minutes, though we'll come to that. I think they were talking about the Great Barrington Declaration at the time. And I think that our segmentation and shielding policy, which is different, got caught up in their eagerness to disapprove, not accept the proposal in the Great Barrington population.

I have to say this is one of the occasions where I became very, very frustrated with SAGE. I don't think they looked at the cocooning proposal. We had looked at it, we had published it, the evidence was there, that cocooning worked. When, to my best recollection, according to the minutes, SPI-M-O was also asked to look at it, they didn't do it properly. They didn't look at the proposal we'd made, they looked at their caricature version of it, which I already knew wouldn't work, and they confirmed it wouldn't work, and that is what SAGE is saying here, it wouldn't work, but our baby got thrown out with that bathwater --

**Counsel Inquiry**: I see.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- I'm afraid, and something that I believe would have worked, as far as I can tell, was never, never considered by them.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right. Well, thank you, Professor. That's something we may then take up with others in due course.

I want to ask you just about two final broad areas. One is the question of transmission in children. Can we go, first of all, please, to your statement at page 34, paragraph 187. Thank you.

Now, at this part of your statement, you refer quite expressly to the period in sort of early-ish or mid-2020. First of all you refer to March 2020 and then later in the paragraph you refer to June 2020, and what you say by reference to those dates is that there was no evidence that school-aged children were at significant risk from Covid-19, as you say, for the good reason that they were not. And then you talk about teachers being exposed.

Do you agree that whatever the position in early 2020, later on in 2020 there did become evidence -- there was evidence available that children were in fact at risk and were catching Covid-19?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So there was definitely a clinical risk to some children, particularly those with a variety of comorbidities, but healthy children, the risk remained extremely low throughout the pandemic, and if it hadn't, of course, we wouldn't have re-opened schools when we did, as almost every other country in the world did. So that was generally agreed. So the clinical risk to children was not that great.

So what I think you're talking about is the risk of infection in children, which, you're quite right, evidence did accumulate that children, particularly older teenaged children --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- in the later years were getting infected, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Pausing there, you're quite right, that is what I was talking about. It's just the fact as to whether children were infected.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Briefly, because I think you accept this, but let's just look, if we may, at INQ000207121, this is a report from Professor Edmunds and Angela McLean, which I know you're familiar with. It's dated 17 October, so later in the year. It's based on or it reports or records two strands of evidence: one, serological data from Public Health England, and the other sort of ONS swab testing.

As we can see, we may not need to go beyond the first paragraph, but what this report tells us, or reports, is that both of those strands of data recently suggest that older children -- sorry, that children, particularly older children, may play a more significant role in transmission than was previously thought.

You, I know, became aware of that report no doubt around the time it came out. Did that lead you to adjust your views from those that you refer to in that paragraph of your statement that we looked at?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, I'm not sure I saw the report in this form but the data were discussed and available outright(?), and it did cause me to wonder about my views, and particularly my views about school, because this was important new evidence.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. So you've got no reason to doubt the evidence that was there at the time that children were being infected with Covid, perhaps much more than had previously been understood. And I know that there is a separate matter which you remained concerned about, which is the question of whether allowing for the new data which suggested that children were being more widely infected than had previously been understood, it followed from that that children should be seen as driving transmission of the disease in the community, and what were your views on that?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So even more specific than that is whether transmission going on in schools was driving the pandemic, and this -- that view, which was held, definitely, by some people in SPI-M, I'm sure they'll tell you themselves, but I think John and Angela both held it, was, of course, a powerful argument for closing schools and keeping them closed. If they were driving the pandemic.

Despite this evidence, which as you say I do accept, it doesn't say directly: are schools driving the pandemic? And it also, when it was published, flew in the face of studies from around the world that said: no, schools are not driving the pandemic, they're playing -- they're making a contribution to transmission, and there was a lot of argument about how big that contribution was, but they're not driving it. So it's that aspect that I continue to challenge.

But I have to say, this caused me a lot of concern, could it be true, but I came to the view that it actually wasn't true, that schools were not driving the pandemic.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Sorry, let's try and unpick that double negative at the end there.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Sorry, I beg your pardon.

**Counsel Inquiry**: As you say, at least one of, perhaps the most important practical issue, to which this data referred, was the question of whether schools should be closed or not, and I think what you're saying is that, notwithstanding this evidence that children themselves, particularly older children, were being infected more than had been understood, you remained of the view that schools themselves and being open wasn't a driver of the pandemic?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. But we don't have to argue on the basis of my opinion versus John and Angela's opinion, we can look at the data. So it was quite clear from conversations in SPI-M that in the November lockdown in England that there was a view that if we didn't close schools the lockdown wouldn't work. And that's consistent with the idea that schools are driving it.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So, if I can -- sounds a bit grim, but if I can call it the "experiment" was done, because the government didn't take that view, and they imposed the lockdown but kept the schools open, and cases fell. And what's particularly striking is that about two weeks, I think it was, into the lockdown, with the schools open, cases fell in the schoolchildren too. That, for me, is the end of the argument. Schools were not driving this.

**Counsel Inquiry**: All right, thank you.

Professor, just finally I'm going to try to ask you some fairly brief questions about these, what I've described as SAGE ways of working. And there are, in your statement, various reflections and criticisms of the way the SAGE structure, in other words SPI-M-O, with SAGE sitting above it, worked.

I want to ask you about just two of those. The first is the question of the composition of SPI-M-O, and if I can summarise it in this way: you say in your statement that SPI-M-O was eminently well suited by its composition to perform all the sort of public health modelling tasks that it was set, but it was limited to that, and you were concerned that there was no expertise either on SPI-M-O or anywhere else that was modelling all of the other impacts on society of the lockdowns and the other NPIs that were being discussed.

Perhaps you can expand on that point and tell us how you think the system should be changed to accommodate those concerns.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: The harms of the social distancing measures, particularly lockdown, the economic harms, the educational harms, the harms to access to healthcare, the harms to societal wellbeing, just the way we all function, mental health, were not included in any of the work that SPI-M-O did. And as you say, as far as I could tell, no one else was doing it either.

So my concern is not so much I think that SPI-M-O wasn't doing it, it would be a much bigger committee, and I think it did a valuable role in doing what it does best, which is looking at the public health component, but somebody somewhere had to be looking at everything else, or I don't see how we could possibly make balanced judgements about what to do.

And may I?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, do, please.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It comes back to this, that lockdown is a failure of public health policy. And I take the view that it would have been very helpful, in making its strategic objectives clear, if the government said explicitly: we don't want to go into lockdown, what's your advice, how can we both minimise the health burden and stay out of lockdown? And we could have given a lot of advice on all the other things you could do other than lockdown.

I think they're more likely to do that if we all in front of us had evidence of the harms that lockdown would do, all those harms, and I couldn't find anyone doing it.

But the question how to avoid lockdown was never asked of us, and I find that extraordinary, and I think that's one of the causes, is we didn't have in front of us the figures that would show how harmful this would be.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you, Professor.

Then the other aspect of the way in which SAGE worked that I wanted to ask you about was the consensus procedure. You refer at an earlier part of your statement to the effect of adopting this consensus procedure being that minority views weren't heard or weren't heard by SAGE and those to whom SAGE communicated.

Then if we can go to a passage towards the end of your statement, please, you return to this theme on page 50, paragraph 281.

If we can look at, as I say, paragraph 281, you say that:

"... SAGE and its subgroups put too much emphasis on consensus and too little on minority views. The most likely outcome -- intended or otherwise -- of only expressing a single view is that it presents policy makers with an overly limited set of options and so will channel policy decisions along a particular route."

May we take it, Professor, that you felt that it was often your minority view that wasn't being heard by policymakers?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's where I'm most sensitive to this issue, that's true, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The argument in favour of consensus, really just redrafts that paragraph we're looking at. The argument is that policymakers will find it easier if they are given one view which a group of experts have, as it were, coalesced around. What do you say to that?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I say that it does exactly what I said, that will channel policy decisions along a particular route that is actually set by the advisers. We're, for example, not offering them alternatives to lockdown, so -- may I? -- in the build-up to that November lockdown in England that we discussed, as far as I could see, SAGE was simply telling the government it should lock down. I was saying what I've said to you before: earlier action can be less drastic action, we don't have to lock down. And in fact there's good evidence now that that lockdown was not strictly necessary. But we could have done much more to avoid it if we had taken early action. And I don't think that view was ever communicated to SAGE, because, as you said to me at the beginning, they were at this harder than you want, earlier than you want, wider than you want point of view. And that clearly was something government was resisting.

So I think government was not given, in the build-up to that lockdown, the full range of policy options it should have been given.

**Mr O'Connor**: Yes.

Professor, thank you very much. Those were all the matters I wanted to raise with you.

My Lady, there will be one or two questions, I think two at least, from Ms Morris, who is here.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you. Ms Morris.

Questions From Ms Morris KC

**Ms Morris**: Thank you, my Lady.

Good afternoon, Professor Woolhouse. I ask questions on behalf of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK. Just two short topics, please.

Firstly, in relation to the evidence of Professor Thomas Hale, have you had the opportunity to read his report or did you hear his evidence to the Inquiry?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I wasn't given his report and I didn't see it, I am afraid.

**Ms Morris KC**: Not to worry, we can have that called up for you. Just two short points I'd like to address with you, please.

It's INQ000257925, page 36, please.

Professor Hale, as you may know, was tasked with the ominous task of looking at NPI effectiveness both in the UK and abroad, and he gave his evidence to her Ladyship last week.

I'm hoping that can be called up. It's page 37 of his report, at paragraph 66. It's focused on the issue of testing, Professor, just so you know where I'm going with my question.

Thank you, it's page 37, paragraph 66, please.

*(Pause)*

**Ms Morris KC**: I'll give you a moment to read that. It's talking about the success of the UK in terms of setting up effective testing, contact tracing, isolation and support measures to prevent small-scale spread of the virus from growing in significant waves.

And Professor Hale made the point that at no point -- I think it's a typographical error, it says "now point", but says he confirms in evidence that:

"... at [no] point was the UK able to achieve a level of testing, contact tracing, and isolation and support at which it could be confident that these light intervention measures would have a chance of preventing new waves from arising."

I wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on that, whether you agreed or disagreed with his --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I very, very strongly agree with that.

There was -- as I'm sure everyone in the room recalls, there was a target set sometime, I think, in the summer or maybe the first half of 2020 of 100,000 tests per day. I'd already expressed my view as to the what I call informally SAGE for Scotland, the C-19 advisory group there, that absolutely testing would prove to be vital in controlling the spread of this infection; going back to what I was saying to Mr O'Connor, always been keen on reducing the rate of spread of this infection. It would be vital. But 100,000 wasn't even close. I mean, it was so inadequate. I had no interest in it, 100,000.

What I wanted to see was mass testing on a scale of literally millions a day, and I was told when I first proposed it that my advice was not serious, that this was not a realistic option.

By December 2021 we were doing self-testing on a scale of ten millions of people a day. It was happening. But there was absolutely no realisation of what needed to be done in that first year. And even then we were so slow to roll out the self-testing. That was a tremendously effective intervention but we didn't get it until the Omicron wave.

**Ms Morris KC**: Are these some of the early and less restrictive options that you have been expanding upon this morning, that are necessary for suppression?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No, because I believe Mr O'Connor was asking me about the early months, so the technology for the lateral flow tests, the self-tests wasn't fully available until maybe November. It was trialled in Liverpool in 2020. That's when we knew we could make the test and do it. So we were relying on a much more cumbersome test, which, to be fair to the 100,000 target, was actually the test they were talking about -- well, one of the tests they were talking about in that target. But, you know, it comes back to, even if we were restricted to the PCR tests, the more cumbersome ones, we needed to be thinking on a much, much bigger scale than 100,000.

**Ms Morris KC**: Understood, thank you.

One more section of Professor Hale's report, please, this is on page 36, and it's paragraph 64. If that could be enhanced, thank you.

I'll give you a moment just to review it. Professor Hale is talking here about the trifecta that the UK experienced: of (1) high numbers of excess deaths and other health impacts; (2) long periods of closure and containment policies; and (3) a significant economic toll. And in his words:

"In 2020 and 2021, especially, the country [that is the UK] followed a 'rollercoaster' pattern. As a new wave arose, restrictive measures were often introduced only when it became apparent that the health system as a whole would be at risk, not earlier, when there might still have been potential to prevent a wave from rising in the first place."

Would you agree with that statement, Professor Woolhouse?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I would. Earlier interventions can be less drastic interventions for precisely that reason. The NPIs we implemented became very much associated with the R number, keeping the R number well below 1, and the reason for that is because we'd allowed the level of infection to rise up in the first place, so you have to drive it down. If you don't let it rise up you don't have to drive it down, so the interventions you need are less severe.

**Ms Morris KC**: Understood, thank you.

My second topic, please, is on care homes and hospitals. Given what you've said this morning in particular about the vulnerability of certain sections of the population, you've noted in your report and your statement that none of the core SPI-M-O models used in the early stages of the pandemic -- they didn't explicitly represent care homes and hospital settings; is that correct?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's correct.

**Ms Morris KC**: These were areas which were known areas of risk for transmission; is that fair to say?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Absolutely, yes.

**Ms Morris KC**: Is there a reason why they weren't expressly represented in modelling?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: My impression of that, I'm sure other views will be shared with you, is because at heart they were influenza models, and they had to be adapted. So influenza models focus on things like schools, because influenza, unlike Covid-19, is driven by infection in schools. Certainly it was in swine flu. So that's what the flu models had in them. They didn't have these other settings because they weren't thinking of them.

And it actually refers back to a question Mr O'Connor asked me, which was about did the lockdown work in the sense of was it essential. One of the things lockdown was not effective at doing, and this is tremendously important, actually was rapidly driving down cases, and their sequelae, in care homes and hospitals. Because those are major institutions and they have their own dynamics. What lockdown did was drive down transmission rates in the wider community. All of us who had to stay at home, we weren't transmitting the virus. But within a hospital, with lots of precautions, but they do have to carry on, and the same with care homes, so the dynamics of the virus in those settings were different, and lockdown did not have such a strong effect in those settings that it did in the community.

**Ms Morris KC**: Just returning back to the modelling, if we may, is it possible to model for those settings?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Ms Morris KC**: Are there any barriers on the data that was available at the time to have modelled in the settings if they'd been asked to be created?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I think it would have been challenging, because it's all very well for me to be saying they should be put in the models, but that part of the model, you have to have the input data, the: okay, I'm saying the transmission rates are different in care homes, but what are they? Well, that wasn't immediately easy to measure. So it would have been difficult. But I don't -- my understanding is the structures weren't even there to attempt it.

**Ms Morris KC**: Right, and you certainly weren't asked?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I wasn't asked?

**Ms Morris KC**: To model the care homes and hospitals.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I cannot remember when either was first raised in SPI-M-O. They became a very regular topic of discussion at SPI-M-O, but I'm afraid I can't remember exactly when they first were introduced into that discussion.

**Ms Morris**: Thank you, that's helpful. Thank you, Professor.

Thank you, my Lady, those are my questions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Morris.

Thank you very much indeed, Professor. I'm not sure that I can make you a promise that we won't call upon your services again, if we may, but you have been extremely helpful, both in the last module and this one, and a lot of very interesting points that you make. Thank you very much for your help.

**The Witness**: Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: And for also trying to alert people to the problem at such an early stage.

**The Witness**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Mr O'Connor**: My Lady, I think we're going to go straight on to our next witness, who is Professor Costello.
