4. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru by Ms Weereratne KC
============================================================================================

**Ms Weereratne**: My Lady, good morning. My Lady will be familiar with the group I represent and I'm privileged to represent this morning, the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice For Cymru has been granted Core Participant status in number of other modules, including 1 and 2, and of course 2B, which is dedicated to scrutinising the decision-making of the Welsh Government. This is, however, as you've noted, my first appearance at this Inquiry in its behalf and I'm honoured to be here. My aim is to be brief in making these submissions. But for the purposes of this different module and for the benefit of those who have not been able to follow earlier hearings, I hope it's permissible to repeat one or two matters that have already been stated in other modules and in our written submissions. My submissions today will address three broad areas: firstly, a few introductory words about the group, some questions on scope and in areas for -- key areas for substantive investigation that are currently of concern for this group, in itemised and in summary form; and finally, to highlight some points on preparatory steps.

Firstly, then, the Cymru group extends its thanks to the Chair for granting it CP status in this module, from which important lessons for the future can be learned. The group was established to ensure proper scrutiny of government decision-making relevant to Wales, this includes in Westminster, the devolved administration in Wales, and local and regional government bodies in Wales.

In granting the group CP status, the Inquiry has recognised its central role in engagement with the Welsh Government, and the strong links it has forged with other interested groups based in Wales who are not themselves CPs, but giving them a voice in this Inquiry.

It's also acknowledged -- it also acknowledges the severity of the impact of the pandemic on the people throughout Wales and the numbers of lives lost. It bears restating that it is crucial that the people of Wales can have full confidence that this public inquiry will fully scrutinise decision making in Wales in relation to the pandemic, and that the experiences and voices of the Welsh people will be properly heard and represented before it. Of course there is currently no separate inquiry in Wales, which adds to the importance of this Inquiry to the Welsh people.

The main decisions made in Wales concerning the pandemic were largely separate to, and also different from, those taken by the UK Government. The devolved nations had their own processes and responsibilities in relation to procurement of :outline:`PPE`, RPE, healthcare equipment and other medical supplies. This highlights why it is so important that the Inquiry examines the decision-making in response to the pandemic of the Welsh Government and its government bodies in addition to the decisions in Westminster and by other devolved nations that might also have had an impact in Wales.

To date the approach taken by this Inquiry and other modules has provided a measure of reassurance that it intends to take Welsh interests seriously. Members of this group have wide-ranging experience of the impact of government decisions on procurement throughout Wales, and stand ready to assist this Inquiry and share its experiences with the public.

Turning then to Module 5 matters more specifically. Of course, this module is just getting under way and, prior to the disclosure and Rule 9 exercises, its shape and scope remains rightly provisional. We do not therefore address scope today in any detail.

We note the overarching framework for this investigation set out by CTI in paragraph 16 of his note. Clearly, questions around the lack of basic resources, such as PPE for health and social care staff, and the lack of due process, and potentially of fraud are likely to feature prominently in this module. And, aligned with our submission highlighting the importance of understanding and investigating the role of each of the four nations, I'm going to say out of an abundance of caution, we ask the Inquiry team for explicit reassurance that all of the questions identified at (a) to (t) of paragraph 16 of the note will be addressed to each of the four nations, and this will include, for example, oversight mechanisms, that's 16(h), and issues of fraud and conflicts of interest, that's 16(i).

And I note in saying that the intervention made a few moments ago by my Lady on the issue of the use of the acronym HMG and the intention that it should include all devolved nations, obviously grateful to hear that, and will assume, hopefully correctly, that this applies to all other -- what I'm going to call are omissions, from my clients' points of view, in that note. And if I might add this for good measure: if -- we would welcome very much if this could be borne in mind for future submissions and notes, simply because it always causes a sharp intake of breath by my clients, and is a small anxiety that could easily be avoided.

I'm grateful.

**Lady Hallett**: Completely understand.

**Ms Weereratne**: Thank you.

So we do acknowledge that the Inquiry's provisional scope outlines explicitly reference to the governments of the UK and devolved nations and we are grateful that the Inquiry continues to respect the need to examine key questions within each of the four nations.

So, from that, I would like to add to our written submission in this way: we say that it's necessary to acknowledge that beyond end users of protective equipment lay patients and care home residents, so that the Inquiry, we say, must not overlook the likely impact on numbers of deaths from mismanagement of procurement and distribution. The question we say that arises or that we'd like to flag at this point, at this early stage, is: does the Inquiry propose to establish or consider how procurement and availability of protective equipment impacted on the numbers of deaths and the avoidability of deaths in this module?

In making that submission, we also note that proposed research work, or KLOEs, which have already been referred to by CTI, and are referred to in the note at paragraph 38, to which I will briefly return shortly, but that -- so far, that does not identify the impact on numbers or deaths as an area for research.

Turning then to points that the Cymru group would like to raise as preliminary issues of scope. And from information currently available to it, we have identified some key initial concerns around procurement questions for Welsh Government decisions, or decisions with a Welsh angle, which we say are likely to have had a direct impact on the number of deaths in Wales, and which we hope will be helpful to the Inquiry team at this stage. And these include, firstly, the effectiveness and quality of items that were procured, including from abroad. Did they meet safety standards or even guard against airborne viruses at all? Whether there were :outline:`sufficient FFP3 masks procured` rather than a focus on gowns, visors and fluid-repellent masks which gave the appearance of a government striving to procure :outline:`PPE` when in fact :outline:`what was needed was protection from airborne viruses`.

This then raises the question about the :outline:`failure to procure the correct RPE and PPE`, the :outline:`failure to have stores of adequate RPE/PPE` so that exorbitant prices were subsequently paid during the pandemic for equipment, the lack of transparency and questions over whether value for money was achieved, and that different approaches were taken within Wales resulting in a postcode lottery for the availability of protective equipment.

Turning then, finally, to more specifically points on the preparatory steps for this module. The Cymru group accepts that KLOEs are an important tool for gathering and analysing experiences shared with Every Story Matters through targeted research. In our submission, priority audiences from each of the four nations should be invite to consider the impact of procurement decisions by their own nations, as identified in the research questions set out in paragraph 38 of CTI's note.

I'd like to turn next, then, to highlight the point that we have made in our written submissions on the proposed Rule 9 updates, particularly in light of the renewed call by other CPs for position statements from government and other bodies. What we've done is to draw attention to the need to have proper detail of the issues raised in Rule 9 requests of state and other organisations, in order to assist us in participating and preparing fully for this module, including by making suggestions for lines of inquiry. Our submission reflects our experience in other modules where the full extent of Rule 9 requests has become known too late in the day so that we've been unable to raise any challenge or speak to the Inquiry team about other key witnesses or issues to be explored with witnesses in good time. Our overarching concern is that this inevitably impedes effective investigation, fairness and full anticipation by CPs.

We are, of course, grateful to the Inquiry for its collaborative approach, and it goes without saying that everyone's resources are stretched in an inquiry of this complexity, and we do note with approval submissions by other CPs for the Inquiry to take all steps to promote fairness and full participation.

We will make further submissions on this and on disclosure -- on the disclosure process in due course as necessary.

We also wish to reserve our position at this stage on expert evidence.

And finally, we would also wish to highlight that members of this group can speak to systemic failings in procurement in Wales, and the shortages of resources in hospital and care home settings where their families and loved ones lost their lives, and so we do invite the Inquiry to hear their testimonies in this module.

With that, my Lady, unless there's anything further I can help the Inquiry with this morning, we look forward to continuing to work in collaboration with the Inquiry team and other CPs in this -- to make this a meaningful and fruitful exercise.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed for your help. Very grateful.

Right, Mr McCaffery, I think you're attending remotely.
