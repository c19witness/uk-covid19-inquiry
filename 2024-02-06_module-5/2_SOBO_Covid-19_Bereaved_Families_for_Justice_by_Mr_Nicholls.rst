2. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Nicholls
=================================================================================

**Mr Nicholls**: My Lady, good morning, I represent the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group. Can I first thank you for allowing us to develop our submissions orally this morning. We've set out our submissions in writing, as I hope you've seen, and of course I won't go through them line by line.

Those submissions are intended in the same constructive spirit that we have sought to adopt throughout the Inquiry. They also seek to ensure, as far as possible, the effective involvement of the bereaved clients that we represent in Module 5.

My Lady, I am conscious that my time is tight and I have a 15-minute guillotine and I know how stringent guillotines can be. Can I therefore indicate briefly how I intend to use the remaining minutes that I have.

First, some very brief introductory comments on Module 5 from the perspective of our client.

And second, I'll move on to address orally but briefly a small number of the points we've addressed in writing, and of course taking into account the helpful update that Mr Wald has just given.

First, then, Module 5. As you have heard Mr Weatherby and others say on previous occasions, my Lady, the broad aim of our clients is to establish what happened to their loved amongst, to participate effectively in that pursuit of the truth, to ensure accountability and to prevent future deaths so that others do not have to go through the same tragedy. Those aims, as I say, are acute in Module 5. As you and your team, my Lady, will know, there has been extensive reporting concerning procurement failures and a lack of preparedness. There have been suggestions of conflicts of interest, and allegations going as far as fraud and corruption.

The clients that I represent, my Lady, look to the Inquiry to expose such failings, if they occurred, to ensure accountability, and, crucially, to identify learning or future prevention.

Having made those brief comments on Module 5, can I then turn to some of the specific points foreshadowed in our written submissions, and, as previously, where I don't address something that is included in the written document, of course we rely on what is set out in writing.

First, scope, at paragraphs 2 to 6 of our written submissions -- I can take this very briefly -- we welcome the broad provisional scope outlined by the Inquiry, including the list of questions helpfully set out at paragraph 16 of CTI's note.

We also note the helpful update from Mr Wald this morning in response to paragraph 5 of our written submissions in particular, in which he confirmed that the issues we have identified there will form part of the Inquiry's examination.

Second topic, disclosure from the Inquiry. We address this at paragraph 9-11 of our written submissions, my Lady, and of course I note the update this morning from Mr Wald that the disclosure from the Inquiry is now anticipated to begin in late spring of 2024. The CTI note previously indicated that it was due to commence in autumn 2024. And of course, earlier disclosure from the Inquiry to our clients is something that we wholeheartedly welcome.

Nonetheless, can I make some brief points about a request for earlier disclosure from the Inquiry than has taken place before in previous modules, and can I start those submissions by making two things clear: first, we fully appreciate that the Inquiry is dealing with many demands and moving at a fast pace. Second, we also consider from our prior experience in other modules that the disclosure being made appears to be that which should be made. We are not suggesting that things are not being disclosed.

However, for our clients, the timing of disclosure in prior modules has been an issue of real concern, and the crux of that concern, my Lady, is this: that we say we need disclosure from the Inquiry earlier than has been happening to date to enable effective participation in the proceedings. The point I'm sure will be a very familiar one to you, my Lady, I wouldn't labour it: if disclosure is received only very shortly before relevant evidence hearings and relevant witnesses, that hinders the ability of our clients to understand the proceedings, to propose lines of questioning, and to assist the Inquiry.

Now, of course, we do not say that all disclosure has come at too late a stage, but having gone through, in a painstaking and extremely boring exercise that Ms Brook, who sits to my right, has done with her team, we've identified that there has been an issue of bottlenecking where large amounts of material is disclosed, sometimes as much as 40-50% of the entire disclosure in a module, in the last month and during the hearing itself of a module. And what we are seeking is for that being repeated in Module 5.

Of course, if disclosure in fact is going to start in early spring 2024, that is welcome, and should help, but we hope that by raising these matters now, early in Module 5, the issues that have arisen previously can be remedied. And as we have said before, my Lady, we would of course be very open to dialogue with your team in seeking to achieve that, and we have sought, at paragraph 11 of the written submissions, to identify some possible steps for your consideration, my Lady.

I won't repeat them, they're in the written submissions. They are matters for your consideration and that of your team, because, of course, you are the ones best placed to know if those go to the issues that have caused some of what I have described as the bottlenecking problem in previous modules.

Third topic, my Lady, position statements. You have heard from Mr Wald and will have seen from our submissions at paragraph 12 that we invite you to direct position statements in Module 5. You will also recall, my Lady, that we have made those submissions before and they have not been accepted.

If I may channel the spirit of Mr Weatherby for a moment, my Lady, we say that the position in Module 5 is now different, that Module 5 is particularly well suited for position statements for the reasons we've summarised in the written submissions but which I can distill to three principal points: first, the general merits of position statements apply to Module 5 as they did previously. Of course that point only goes so far, it's been rejected before.

But, to the extent that Mr Wald says you may consider that they will have a negative impact on Inquiry resources and time, as we have said before, we consider that done properly, and in a focused manner, they will save both resources and time. You have the point.

Second, we say the subject matter of Module 5, including allegations of improper conduct and corporate bodies putting profit before public safety, is particularly well suited to position statements. Can I refer briefly, by reference to another Inquiry, to the submissions that were made by lead CTI at the end of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry in November 2022, when he described "a merry-go-round of buck-passing" from corporate and state core participants seeking to protect their own interests, that had created "a spider's web of blame".

That, of course, was a different case. But, my Lady, we say that position statements in Module 5 would assist this Inquiry to avoid the risk of the same form of merry-go-round and evasion which we have no doubt your Inquiry seeks to avoid, and which our clients seek to avoid as well.

Third, and finally on this point, my Lady, since your Module 5 ruling, which CTI have noted in their written note, there have been a number of meaningful and material instances of non-compliance with the Inquiry's Rule 9 requests.

Position statements can help to avoid such issues and that is particularly relevant because Mr Wald suggested that one reason you may think position statements remain inappropriate is because of the Rule 9 process. But of course, if the Rule 9 process is not complied with, we say that supports, now, the use of position statements.

That's all I say on that, having managed to get through that submission without interruption., my Lady.

Fourth point, experts. Submissions are at 13 to 14 of the written submissions. The core point is this, my Lady: our clients wish to be involved in the Inquiry's instruction of experts. The Inquiry allowed that approach in selecting the structural racism experts. Of course, the choice of who to instruct and what to ask is ultimately a matter for the Inquiry. But our clients seek collaboration on that issue for their own benefit and to assist the Inquiry.

The note from CTI, not altered in the oral update -- for your note, my Lady, it's paragraph 34 -- indicates that in Module 5 the Inquiry will withhold from core participants the identities of the experts and the questions they will be asked until they have completed their draft reports. We do not see that that is a necessary or sensible approach, and we invite a reconsideration of it.

Fifth topic, the Inquiry's liaison with relevant criminal investigations. We note the update from Mr Wald. There is little we can say other than this: our clients' position is that the Inquiry should be speaking with criminal investigators to assist the Inquiry's work, for example, in identifying relevant themes, topics, materials and witnesses. And the update we seek, as summarised at 15-18 of our written submission, is, so far as possible without risking prejudice to such investigations, an update on what liaison has taken place, including with whom, the terms of such contact, and how the Inquiry in practical terms proposes to manage and benefit from the overlap between its own scope and the work of such investigations.

Sixth topic, undertakings. And here I'm of course referring to the possibility of seeking undertakings from the Attorney General. And, my Lady, you're nodding your head, you know this issue very well, you've seen that we've sought, I hope relatively neutrally, to set out the context at 19-23 of our written submissions. You will understand the issue well, my Lady.

For those listening and with perhaps less experience of what is a rather technical legal issue, can I seek to summarise the issue in this way for those who are listening. The issue is whether you, my Lady, consider now or at some later stage that an undertaking should be sought from the Attorney General so that witnesses and/or organisations, that is to say legal persons who would otherwise or may otherwise seek to assert the privilege against self-incrimination and thus not give relevant evidence, can instead give such evidence.

Set against that rationale for seeking such an undertaking are a range of factors that may weigh against such an undertaking. And I should say we have taken these from, among other sources, the rulings of prior inquiries that have dealt with the issue, as well as from a pro forma template indicating the very factors that the Attorney General him or herself considers when such requests have previously been made. They include, first, that a witness may not assert the privilege at all, or may only do so in response to specific issues, rendering an undertaking unnecessary.

Second, it may be considered that the Inquiry can reach conclusions and discharge its terms of reference even if the privilege is asserted by one or more witnesses or organisations. For example, by reliance on the totality of the evidence that others have given and that's been obtained.

And third, and perhaps most importantly, it may be considered that seeking an undertaking or undertakings may seriously undermine victim and public confidence in the Inquiry itself by seeking an undertaking that would be granted to those responsible for serious failings, including where such failings have or may have contributed to thousands of deaths.

We say, my Lady, that this is an important issue. It can impact confidence in the Inquiry and, if not grappled with at an early stage, it can inadvertently frustrate and delay the Inquiry's work, which no one wants.

We understand from constructive discussions with your team, my Lady, that this is an issue under active consideration and our submission at this stage is a simple one: we invite an update as soon as possible on the Inquiry's position so it can be aired and resolved. But in the hope it assists the Inquiry's thinking, my Lady, and yours, can I make three short points as to our likely position? And I just want to clarify one matter that Mr Wald made in his update. He said that we would oppose. What we in fact say is we are likely to oppose, because of course this is being addressed at a relative degree of abstraction at this stage. But the three points are this: first, we're likely to argue against an undertaking, essentially for the reasons set out in the written submissions. First, we consider that doing so at this stage would be premature. The proper course is witnesses and organisations should first be asked the relevant questions through the Rule 9 process and their responses assessed before any consideration is given to the issue.

Second, in exercising your important judicial function in this Inquiry, my Lady, we say that you should be slow, indeed very slow, to seek an undertaking that affords protection to those responsible for the kinds of failures that I've identified.

Third, the confidence point. You have the point, I say no more.

Fourth, an undertaking may well be unnecessary. There is an experience from some inquiries indicating that the undertaking issue, if grappled with too early, can lead to an overstating of the impact of the privilege. There can be a benefit to playing out the process so that you, my Lady, can assess what people say and on what basis, and assess the privilege stage by stage as the law requires rather than jumping straight to the issue.

Penultimate headline point from us, we say that the possibility that the privilege will be asserted should not inform decisions on who are relevant witnesses to seek information and disclosure from. The issues are distinct and should be kept separate. Witnesses and organisations should be selected on relevance, based on proper questions the Inquiry wishes to ask. What witnesses say in response comes later.

Finally, my Lady, and this is my final point and I'll sit down, having exhausted a little more, I think, than my 15 minutes, my Lady, you may consider it appropriate to direct that any applications asking you to approach the Attorney General should be made promptly with a fixed cut-off time set, to avoid the issues I alerted to earlier: that is that the issue is raised too late, and can cause delay and compromise the viability of the Inquiry's evidence hearings.

On the listening exercise and commemoration you have our written submissions. My Lady, in light of the time, I won't say any more on those. Thank you for the time and, unless I can assist you further, those are our submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: You have been very helpful, Mr Nicholls, thank you. And there is no need to channel your inner Mr Weatherby, the inner Mr Nicholls does a very good job. Thank you very much.

**Mr Nicholls**: I'm very grateful.

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Wilcock?
