3. Submissions on Behalf of Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Wilcock KC
====================================================================================================

**Mr Wilcock**: I'm not entirely sure the length of my submissions justifies me having a lectern but I will take it since I was offered it anyway.

My Lady, I appear in this module on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign, instructed by PA Duffy & Co, and I make these short oral submissions in the knowledge that our written submissions, dated 29th January, are publicly available, that your Ladyship will be aware that, unless we say otherwise, we adopt and support those submissions and those made today orally by Mr Nicholls on behalf of the UK Covid Bereaved Families for Justice. And that particularly applies to submissions you've just heard in relation to the role of the people -- the group I represent within the Inquiry, the timing of disclosure, the use of position statements, and the process for the instruction of expert witnesses.

Your Ladyship, Mr Nicholls understandably didn't go into detail on the issues of commemoration of individual deaths and pen portrait. I am not going to use up all my time so I can say that we would ask you to look in detail at the submissions we make in relation to that, at paragraphs 26 of -- 25 and 26 of our written note.

On 11 December 2023 you informed P Duffy & Co that you considered the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice campaign is well placed to assist this Inquiry to achieve its aims in Module 5, by representing the collective interest of a broad spectrum of those bereaved in Northern Ireland as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic in relation to matters relevant to Module 5, as set out today by Mr Wald, King's Counsel, and including: the procurement and distribution of key healthcare-related equipment and supplies, including PPE, ventilators and oxygen to end users across Northern Ireland; consideration of the robustness and effectiveness of the procurement processes; the adequacy of the items obtained and the effectiveness of their distribution to the end user; and the UK and Northern Ireland-wide procurement of lateral flow tests and PCR tests.

As you have acknowledged, my Lady, many of the group I represent have experienced firsthand many of the issues which the Inquiry will investigate in Module 5, including not only the distribution of such key healthcare-related equipment and supplies, but also the adequacy of the items obtained, the effectiveness of their distribution within Northern Ireland, and the challenges experienced, especially in relation to procurement of lateral flow tests and PCR tests in particular, you won't be surprised to hear, in relation to the facilities in which their loved ones were being treated.

My Lady, I'm grateful for your counsel's indication as to the scope of the Inquiry, and the indication that that means there will be an examination of the approach to procurement across all the devolved nations separately. And equally grateful for your clarification that, in terms of the way questions are phrased, one must be careful, and I adopt the submissions you've heard on behalf of the Cymru team in relation to that and thank you for that clarification.

But my Lady, an illustration of why it may be important from the Northern Ireland perspective to look at procurement through the Northern Irish lens may be evident in the fact that in April 2023 the Northern Ireland Audit Office published a document entitled "Public Procurement in Northern Ireland", which observed (i) that according to Department of Finance estimates, around 25% of the total resources available to the Northern Ireland Executive are used for procurement. Now, plainly I'm talking in general sense rather than in Covid sense, but it gives an indication of the importance of the general issue of procurement to the Northern Ireland political process, and, coincidentally, to the Covid pandemic.

In 2020 the New Decade, New Approach, which you will hear much more about when you come to Belfast, made transforming how public procurement operates a key priority of the Executive, and was followed by number of different initiatives intended to modernise how procurement functions in the north of Ireland.

In that context, your Ladyship is already well aware of the parlous state of the health system in Northern Ireland, and it is with some relief that, for the first time since this Inquiry began, we do not have to tell you that we do not have a functioning Executive, and we all hope that recent events will mark the time when steps can be taken to rectify the crisis within the Northern Ireland health and social care system.

As far as this module is concerned, and in the light of the resumption of power sharing in Belfast, we note that, although a number of individual members of the Executive between 2020 and 2022 -- and Mr Wald did his best to pronounce their names correctly when he read them out -- have been granted CP status. To our knowledge, no such application has been made, or certainly granted, in relation to the Northern Ireland Executive Office, which is different to the approach taken by that office in relation to other modules.

My Lady, it's a matter for not us who applies and who is granted, but we make that passing observation.

In any event, we look forward to working with your Ladyship, your legal team, and all other core participants in your investigations in this module in order, as we put it in our written submissions, to make this Inquiry work.

My Lady, I don't think there's anything more that I can say unless there's anything in particular you would wish me to deal with?

**Lady Hallett**: No, I'm very grateful, Mr Wilcock, and, as I know I speak for everyone here, we share your hopes that the Executive can at last get back to making sure Northern Ireland is governed.

**Mr Wilcock**: Thank you very much.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

It's a break now, I think, and I shall return at 11.55.

*(11.38 am)*

*(A short break)*

*(11.56 am)*

**Lady Hallett**: Right.

Ms Weereratne KC, I'm so sorry, have -- can you pronounce your name for me just so I can get it right in the future, I'm really sorry.

**Ms Weereratne**: Good morning, that was precisely my first intention, was to say my name, and not as a matter of ego but just to say it's Aswini Weereratne. Every syllable to be pronounced.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.
