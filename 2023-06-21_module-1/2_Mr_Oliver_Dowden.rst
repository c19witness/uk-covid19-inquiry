===================

*MR OLIVER DOWDEN (sworn).*

Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry

**Mr Keith**: Deputy Prime Minister, could you please provide your name.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes. Oliver James Dowden.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you very much for your assistance in this Inquiry, and for attending today.

Whilst I ask you questions, could you please remember to keep your voice up, so we may have the benefit of hearing what you have to say, and also for the purposes of the stenographer's record.

If I ask you a question which is not clear, feel free to ask me to repeat it.

You have provided a witness statement dated and signed 18 April 2023.

Could we have, please, on the screen INQ000183332, thank you very much.

And page 5, the statement of truth to which you have appended your signature; is that correct?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that's correct.

May I begin, Mr Keith, just by reiterating what I said at the beginning of that statement, which is to say that the Covid crisis that hit our nation was the biggest challenge we faced during peacetime, and it impacted every family in our nation, and I just want to restate my deepest sympathies and condolences to all of those affected and, on behalf of the government, to say that we want to positively engage with this Inquiry and to learn the lessons that will come out of it.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you.

Mr Dowden, you have been Deputy Prime Minister since April of this year, and since February you have been the newly created Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office and, since October of last year, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, but you were not always so, because in 2018 you were appointed Parliamentary Secretary for the Cabinet Office, that is to say the Minister for Implementation, and then in July 2019 you were appointed to be Minister for the Cabinet Office and then Her Majesty's Paymaster General.

So as Minister for Implementation and then subsequently as Minister for the Cabinet Office, in a broad sense were the issues of cyber and resilience within your various portfolios?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that is correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: The Inquiry has noted that, as Minister for Implementation, your responsibilities included cyber and resilience. Whilst you were Minister for the Cabinet Office and Her Majesty's Paymaster General, your responsibilities included resilience. Now, currently, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, your responsibilities include concurrent risk and supervision and the promulgation of the Resilience Framework, to which we will come back to later.

The ministerial structure appears to be a little diffuse, therefore, in terms of who takes responsibility for the issue of resilience.

Can you help us, please, by way of commencement, on that point?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, well, perhaps if I start with the present, as it were, which is where you ended, Mr Keith.

So, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, I have responsibility for resilience and the Prime Minister has asked me to chair the national security committee subcommittee on resilience, so I have oversight in that sense as well, and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, indeed Deputy Prime Minister, I'm the lead minister in the Cabinet Office, and many of the cross-cutting and co-ordinating functions of government, including in respect of resilience, sit within the department for which I am responsible.

In respect of my previous ministerial roles, when I was first appointed as Minister for Implementation, as you say that's a parliamentary secretary, so in sort of governmental language that's the junior minister, a junior minister, in the Cabinet Office, I reported in to David Lidington, who was then the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, so I had a number of specific responsibilities allocated to me, and he, in the same way that I have now, had oversight of the department. So clearly I worked closely with him on questions of resilience and cyber.

I think on the point about cyber and resilience, and indeed many of the other aspects of my portfolio then and now, a lot of them sort of interlink with one another in terms of the government's cross-cutting and co-ordinating role through the Cabinet Office to enable resilience. So cyber resilience is an important part of resilience, and in discharging duties in relation to cyber resilience, and indeed wider resilience, I would draw on the Government Commercial Function of service and -- it had different names over time, and indeed the Government Digital Service and other aspects of the portfolio.

**Lead Inquiry**: In respect specifically of the differences between the portfolios held by the Minister for Implementation, the Parliamentary Secretary for the Cabinet Office, to which you were first appointed, and the Minister for the Cabinet Office, how did those various responsibilities concerning resilience differ? Was it that the Minister for the Cabinet Office was more senior but that the Minister for the Cabinet Office and the Minister for Implementation covered broadly the same ground?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: So first of all in respect of the Minister for Implementation, I was the responsible minister within a ministerial structure where I reported to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and he and I met and discussed it and he had overall responsibility for everything within the Cabinet Office portfolio, including resilience and cyber.

Then what happened when Boris Johnson became Prime Minister in, I believe it was, July of 2019, he took the decision that, given that we had to be prepared for the no-deal -- it wasn't really a contingency, it was a default of the government, given that we'd made the decision to leave and we had this deadline that was going to expire by the end of the year, if we didn't reach a deal with the European Union, we would have had -- no-deal would have happened, so this was a major area that we had to be resilient to. So he said, "Look, I need the most senior minister in the Cabinet Office", who at that time was Michael Gove, "to take responsibility for no-deal preparedness" --

**Lead Inquiry**: As Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: -- "as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and I want you, Oliver, as Minister for the Cabinet Office, to have responsibility for all other areas in the Cabinet Office", which of course included cyber and resilience.

**Lead Inquiry**: So from that point onwards, you took responsibility, as for the Cabinet Office, for cyber and resilience, and you took that portfolio in effect, although perhaps not set out constitutionally in writing, from the Minister for Implementation?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, I --

**Lead Inquiry**: Because formerly you had, as the Minister for Implementation, already been addressing the issue of cyber and resilience?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, so there was a continuity, in that sense, of my responsibility for cyber and resilience across to being Minister for the Cabinet Office. Clearly my role also expanded in respect of the other ministerial duties which are set out in some of the documentation that the Inquiry has.

The only small caveat I would add to that is that resilience -- and it was the most significant resilience risk we faced at that moment, in respect of no-deal Brexit -- sat with Michael Gove as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right, thank you.

You made reference a few moments ago to a subcommittee, the National Security Council's subcommittee on resilience. Is that a re-formed version of what was formerly the National Security Council's Threats, Hazards, Resilience and Contingencies committee, which, to use a phrase utilised by Ms Hammond, Ms Katharine Hammond, last week, came out of the committee structure? Is it a re-formed version of that committee or is it the same committee, do you know?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, it's -- it shares some characteristics of the previous -- I believe the shorthand for it is the THRC committee -- in the sense -- so what is different between the NSCR and THRC is that the NSCR seeks to take a more upstream view of risks and resilience and look at strategies to stop risks materialising in the first place.

So, for example, we considered in a recent meeting the biosecurity strategy. So it takes -- it takes a sort of more strategic view in that sense. It does have the capability to make cross-governmental decisions in respect of specific risks and resilience, and so has that in common with THRC. So it shares some of the characteristics of it, but it is wider in the way that I described.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

Is that the biosecurity strategy that was, I think, published by the government last Monday?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: That's correct, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

May I then ask you to give us a broad description of the nature of your functions when you first became Minister for Implementation, with particular reference of course to resilience.

You were responsible, were you not, for the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, that part of the Cabinet Office that was concerned with emergency preparedness, resilience and response. You presumably were responsible for co-ordinating, through your ministerial position, EPRR, emergency preparedness, response and resilience across government, the working with other government departments that the Cabinet Office was centrally concerned with, the liaison through the Cabinet Office with the devolved administrations and local responders, and the policy and the guidance as well as the strategising, of which we've heard a great deal from earlier witnesses.

So the Minister for Implementation was responsible, through the Cabinet Office, for those broad areas concerning resilience; is that broadly correct?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that's broadly correct, subject to two points. First of all, and I know that the Inquiry has discussed this extensively, but just as a reminder from my perspective, this was in the context of the lead government department model.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: That is to say, each of the 90-odd risks that were identified in the NRSA and the -- the precursor documents and the successor documents were allocated to individual government departments. The job of the Cabinet Office and -- as is the case in many other areas, was co-ordination and facilitation, and ensuring the bits of government stitched together to ensure that that happened.

The second thing is, again, further to what I said initially, that was in the structure where the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had overall responsibility for the Cabinet Office, and I reported in to him.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes, indeed.

So the Cabinet Office had no operational responsibility in the field of resilience and emergency preparedness, its primary function was to set the broad direction, to deal with the strategy, the policy guidance and this crucial liaison between the various moving parts of the government, the lead government department, other government departments, devolved administrations, local responders and so on?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that's correct, and that is the sort of typical role of the Cabinet Office in many different areas and it was replicated in the resilience function as well.

**Lead Inquiry**: In your witness statement, you say that you were briefed that major programmes of work were under way to improve readiness across government for an influenza pandemic, and that you were generally assured that the government was reasonably and sufficiently prepared for an influenza pandemic.

May we presume that those briefings came from the Cabinet Office by virtue of your role initially as Minister for Implementation and then subsequently as a Cabinet Office minister?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that's correct. So in common when most ministers take up a new portfolio, I sought briefing across all the areas for which I was responsible, which included resilience and, as I said, the sort of 90-odd resilience risks identified in the NRSA. I should say, in addition to that there are many other areas of resilience which are not actually included in that document, whether it's sort of resilience in terms of cross-Channel strikes or all the other sort of things that government has to deal with.

Clearly, as part of that, I'm sure that -- I know the Inquiry is familiar with the way the risk matrix works, which is that we assess both likelihood and impact and, given that a pandemic flu consistently sat up in the top right-hand corner, that was something that I took an interest in, along with other risks, and so I asked for further specific briefing on that, received that briefing, and indeed throughout my time as a minister received further briefings, all of which were consistent with advice that we were broadly in a pretty strong state of preparedness.

I relied, for example, on the international service. Now, I know there has been questions and criticisms about how those worked, but those were things that gave me assurance, and indeed there were -- throughout my time in office I received further pieces of information and briefing which reinforced that general picture.

**Lead Inquiry**: Deputy Prime Minister, to what extent, when a minister receives briefings, do the briefings descend into the specifics and the detail? You've referred to your understanding of the risk assessment process, for example. Presumably the briefings would have covered areas such as the risk assessment process, the workings of a Pandemic Flu Readiness Board, which was co-chaired by the Cabinet Office and the DHSC, the exercises, the major exercises which were being carried out by the Cabinet Office, for example Exercise Cygnus in 2016 and its aftermath, and perhaps the workings, the most important workings of the DHSC in relation to pandemic preparedness, the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Programme, the PIPP programme. Is that broadly correct, that you would have been aware of the broad nature of the pillars of the government's approach to pandemic preparedness, but not perhaps the detail at a lower level?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, first of all, it would depend on the stage at which I was a minister. So when I was first appointed as the minister, you know, I was told in broad terms, you know: this is the resilience architecture, so we have the NRSA, we have the Civil Contingencies Secretariat which sits within the department, we have the lead government department model, so, for example, in relation to terrorism risks, those are held by the Home Office and the Home Secretary, in respect of health and biosecurity risks broadly those were held by the Department of Health.

I would then, through a process of iteration, ask further questions about specific areas within that, and then subsequently during my time in office, as issues arose I would receive further briefing, either because there was a decision that had to be made, so I had to agree and scrutinise and sign off a particular document or piece of cross-government working, or because there was something that was coming sort of up as something that was moving from risk to something that may materialise. So, for example, Ebola was an example of something that we looked at during that time. There were many other examples. And of course across the wider resilience there was, as is the case most winters, there's flooding, there's occasional storms, there's all those sort of things that require a degree of cross-government co-ordination.

A lot of what you do as the Minister for the Cabinet Office, or a minister in the Cabinet Office, is you -- you kind of just -- you need to know when something remains with the lead government department or if the lead -- you often find a lead government department will come to you and say: We need some help with some cross-government work. And you'd kind of, supporting that, well, make a decision whether that was appropriate for us or something that would vest with the lead government department.

**Lead Inquiry**: So, as the minister, you're plainly dependent on anticipated risks and issues and problems being brought to your attention. You can't be responsible, of course, for every aspect of your department's operation, you won't know what all the correspondence amounts to, you are dependent on the system bringing matters which require ministerial input to your attention?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, but in -- but that's not to say that a minister is entirely passive in this situation, one sits there and waits for officials to bring stuff to one's desk. I was very much engaged, and I know most ministers are, for want of a better word, in the wider sort of civic society in respect of that.

So, just to give you some examples, frequently there'd be questions asked in Parliament, whether those were written or oral questions, there would be select committee reports produced, there would be independent bodies that produced reports, the media of course would report on these things from time to time.

So I would frequently pick up -- I would either have those things put in my box so I would see them or I would independently pick them up and I would walk into my private office in the morning or after the weekend with a list of things that had come to my attention that I wanted to receive a further briefing on. So it was more of a sort of interactive process.

But remember, my responsibility as a minister was to drive the overall direction of the department. I'm not personally an expert in the details of any of the individual risks. My job is to ensure that the department moves in the right direction, is directed in the correct way, and working closely with the Prime Minister and others to ensure that the priorities of the department and the conduct of government reflect the priorities of the government as a whole.

**Lead Inquiry**: My Lady heard evidence from Sir Oliver Letwin, you may have seen the evidence, I don't know, but he gave evidence about how, when he was appointed as a minister, he threw himself personally into one or two aspects or a number of aspects of his department, on account of his concern about whether or not there were issues that required to be attended to, and he called for specific reviews of a number of areas, departmental areas, and carried out himself, personally, some of those reviews.

Given the sheer number of obligations in the portfolio of the Minister for Implementation and the Minister for the Cabinet Office, were you ever able to throw yourself personally into that sort of review of the field of civil contingencies?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes. So almost immediately after I was appointed as Minister of Implementation, Carillion, a major government supplier, essentially went bankrupt, so there were immediate challenges for me and I tended to lead on it, working with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to ensure that we were resilient and we responded to the collapse of this major government supplier essentially to ensure that there was a continuity of delivery of public services across the board.

But also I was very mindful of the resilience of the remaining providers, because -- I won't quote Lady Bracknell but, you know, we didn't want to lose another one, let's put it that way. So I spent a lot of time working with officials both on the resilience, to ensure that if we lost another one we would be resilient to it, but also with each of those strategic suppliers to understand, pretty much on a daily and then latterly a weekly basis, the financial position of those strategic suppliers, so I had a strong insight as to what the risk landscape looked like, and then off the back of that I instituted, with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a programme of reform of government procurement and the approach that we took to our major strategic suppliers. So -- and there are other examples like that.

**Lead Inquiry**: What about in relation to health resilience or pandemic planning, so the particular field with which of course this Inquiry is concerned?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: There wasn't the sort of activity that I've described in respect of Carillion. It was the case, though -- two things. First of all, and I hope that the documents that the Inquiry has demonstrate it, I was reassured on a number of occasions, and I know this is subject to a subsequent debate by the Inquiry, and we can go over it in hindsight, but I was assured that we were in a strong state of resilience for it.

But in addition to that, I did, as issues arose, ask specific questions and indeed seek routine updates as well. So, for example, I asked to have a specific overview of resilience readiness across a range of different issues. That happened periodically, and I met with officials periodically, and I would periodically pick up issues in that context.

**Lead Inquiry**: We're now going to look at some of the documents to which you've referred, Deputy Prime Minister, and it's right that in your statement you say that you were briefed that a major programme of work was under way and you were generally assured that the government was reasonably and sufficiently prepared for an influenza pandemic, and you were broadly content that the government was taking reasonable and proportionate steps.

May we please have INQ000145720. This is a document that you won't have seen before this Inquiry, because it wasn't sent to you. It's an email from Katharine Hammond dated 20 September 2018, and it wasn't addressed to you. But it's an email that concerns the general field of resilience and preparedness for pandemic flu, and it's an email within the Cabinet Office, between the civil servants in the Cabinet Office, concerning, in September of 2018 -- so when you were a minister, the Minister for Implementation -- the priorities of the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board, to which we'll come back, and about which I know you're familiar.

At the bottom of the page, before the sign-off, before -- the penultimate paragraph, there are these words:

"Messages to the [Department of Health and Social Care]/[Cabinet Office] Ministers and in particular [the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster] as chair of the NSC(THRC) [committee] [the committee to which you referred earlier] given there are clear risks associated with not taking forward the [Pandemic Flu Readiness Board] programme."

So it would seem from this internal communication within the Cabinet Office that officials were considering the nature of the message which would have to be sent to ministers, including yourself, but in particular the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, about the clear risks associated with not taking forward the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board programme.

So given your statement that you were generally assured that the government was reasonably and sufficiently prepared and that you were briefed that the government was in a moderately decent position and that readiness was being improved, to what extent were you told at that time -- September '18 -- that there were risks in relation to the discharge of your own ministerial role associated with what was being discussed, which was not taking forward the programme at all for pandemic flu readiness?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, first of all, as you said, I didn't specifically receive this email. I would take issue with the point that you're saying that -- not taking forward at all, because the -- it was the case that I did receive advice about some of the re-prioritisation that was happening, and indeed I was specifically assured that, in respect of the two key areas that sat specifically within the Cabinet Office -- and if the Inquiry will forgive the term, it's just the wording that is used across government -- on excess deaths, that's to say the risk of increased mortality, that that work programme would continue.

I was also -- received assurance that the Pandemic Flu Bill preparedness would continue. So in the -- the advice that -- how this sort of transpired into the advice that I received as a minister was that re-prioritisation was happening, and we can come on to the -- if you wish to -- reasons for that re-prioritisation.

**Lead Inquiry**: We will.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: But that in respect of core areas for pandemic flu preparedness, and particularly areas for which the Cabinet Office was responsible, that work continued.

What I would also say is that in the -- it is the case that the way the resilience function works is it has to have flexibility. So programmes of work are set out and, as different challenges face the government, we flex resources accordingly. The key areas have to keep on going. Other areas we reach a certain state of readiness and then we resume them subsequently.

So this was -- this was in the context of what I was familiar with, which is the constant flexing of resources, because bearing in mind we have -- we were dealing with 90-odd different risks, some of them were materialising, others weren't, we had to make judgements across the board.

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed. We, of course, are only concerned with the risks relating to health emergencies and -- including pandemic planning.

INQ000145721 is a 10 January 2019 submission to David Lidington MP, who was then, as you will recall, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and therefore the senior minister. You were at that stage still the parliamentary secretary, and Minister for Implementation.

This is a memo entitled "Delivery of NSC [that's the National Security Council] (THRC) [Threats, Hazards, Resilience and Contingencies] programmes".

To remind ourselves, the NSC(THRC) committee was the committee which was taken out of committee structure in July 2019 when, as is customary, the incoming government changed the committee structures associated with the Cabinet and its subcommittees.

"Delivery of work programmes commissioned by NSC(THRC) on pandemic influenza ... are expected to be affected by the step-up in planning for a no-deal exit from the European Union."

So in a general sense, although the evidence shows that you're absolutely right that some parts of the work programmes, and some work programmes did continue, there was a general impact on the delivery of the NSC(THRC) programmes as a result of the re-prioritisation of work necessitated by planning for a no-deal exit; that's correct, isn't it?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes. What I would say is, again, and forgive me, in the context of what I said already, namely that we had to ensure that we allocated resources according to where the greatest risk lay.

Now, it was the case at that time that no-deal was the default position of the government. So it was appropriate, given -- and this is worth remembering -- the kind of frankly apocryphal warnings that were being delivered about the consequence of no-deal Brexit, for example in relation to medicine supplies and elsewhere, it was appropriate that we shifted the resilience function to deal with this.

Secondly, it was not a permanent shift. We knew that this thing would come to an end since we had an end point for -- if we didn't reach a deal, no-deal would happen.

The other point I would make on that, it has come out, I think, in some of the evidence, is that there was a flip side to this, which was that the preparation, particularly through the Yellowhammer structures made us match fit for when we did have to deal with the actual materialisation of the Covid pandemic. That is to say, it forced governments to -- departments to work together closely, so there was a lot more cross-government co-ordination, and in addition in relation to this we surged additional capacity into the department, I believe we recruited around 15,000 extra staff, who then were able to be re-deployed, once the threat of no-deal had passed, in order to further step up our preparedness for -- or to contribute to our Covid response.

**Lead Inquiry**: We will look in due course at the undoubted benefits, and there were benefits, from the planning associated with the planning for a no-deal exit, but in relation to your point, if I may observe, that the preparations were required, my question was premised deliberately on an acceptance that the preparations for the no-deal exit were necessitated. My Lady has the point already and it forms no part of this Inquiry to examine into the worth of those preparations. They were necessary as part of the plans for a no-deal exit.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: What I would say briefly on that, and I say this as somebody who voted -- don't want to re-litigate it -- as somebody who voted for remain in the referendum. It was not a question of one's view on Brexiting or not, it was just a fact that we had triggered Article 50 and that the default was that without a deal we would have no deal. So that was the default. So it was really incumbent on government, and in delivering my duties in respect of resilience I appreciated very strongly I had to make sure that the United Kingdom was in the best possible position, as did every minister, to deal with no-deal. And actually in doing that, as I said, we did get some other benefits from it.

**Lead Inquiry**: But the reality was that those preparations, necessary though they were, had a direct and significant impact upon the majority of the work programmes to prepare for pandemic influenza?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: No, I don't actually -- I don't fully accept that.

So the core responsibilities that certainly I had in respect of Cabinet Office, in terms of our areas under the pandemic flu preparedness, continued, namely the excess deaths work and the work in respect of Pandemic Flu Bill drafting, both of which, by the way, were then subsequently -- the learnings from that were used when the Covid crisis hit us. It was also the case that there was this constant flexing that happened.

When one takes it in the round, in terms of how ... it essentially tested our ability to work together. There's countless other examples of that. So, for example, the battle rhythm of having these daily XOs, the fact that we had a realtime data coming in and going out again. All of those things actually put us in a position of being in a strong position. And the advice that I received was that the core stuff that we had to do was continuing, but in line with the normal re-prioritisation that happens -- you know, for example when Salisbury hit there was a re-prioritisation. I've just been dealing with -- chairing the COBRs on the evacuation of British nationals from Sudan. There is always a flex, and if we didn't have that flex we would not be in such a strong position to respond to challenges as they hit the government.

**Lead Inquiry**: If you look at paragraph 2 of this memo, addressed to your then senior ministerial colleague, "Recommendations":

"2. That you agree:

"- That the significant majority of the pandemic influenza and [irrelevant and sensitive material is then redacted] ... due to report back to NSC(THRC) in March and February 2019 respectively, are paused until the completion of Operation Yellowhammer."

Operation Yellowhammer was the operational name given to the necessary preparations which were being made for a no-deal exit, is it not?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that is Operation Yellowhammer, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Therefore that paragraph states in terms that the "significant majority of the pandemic influenza and ... due to report back ... are paused". So a reference, no doubt, to the workstreams or the preparations or the plans. A significant majority are paused.

So my earlier question to you was: is it not right that there was a direct and significant impact on the planning for pandemic influenza as a result of the necessary plans being carried out to deal with a no-deal exit?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: So clearly -- and by the way I should notice, as you know, that I didn't actually receive this specific sub -- but the -- I don't dispute the pausing point. It is set out there. My -- the area where I -- I just person -- I take a different view given my experience as a minister at the time --

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: -- was the point about the significant impact for the reasons that I set out and I won't reprise them.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: What I would also say, though, forgive me, is that it is also worth viewing this in the context of documents that I received, which gave me assurances that in respect of particularly the Cabinet Office areas for which I was responsible, that work was continuing. So I just can't -- from my perspective that was not how it was at the time.

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed.

Page 2, please, of this memo, which absolutely correctly did not go to you, paragraph 8 says:

"The Government's decision in December 2018 to step up contingency planning ... is placing unprecedented resource pressure on both Lead Government Departments and the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, which is co-ordinating Operation Yellowhammer across Government. A number of Departmental teams have already been re-tasked, with the majority expected to follow over the coming weeks. CCS is also prioritising Operation Yellowhammer work, and identifying non-time critical work which can be paused accordingly."

Is that an accurate summation, as you understood it to be, of the consequences of the decision to initiate Operation Yellowhammer, as far as you were being briefed?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Erm ... forgive me, just to re-read this.

So I think -- yes, in some respects. I would just say two -- two further things, which is that -- I won't reprise the point about the normal nature of flexing resources. Clearly this was at the extreme end of flexing those resources and that's reflected there.

There is -- it is also the case that when we face challenges, the other thing we all do, senior ministers, ministers and certainly my officials in my department, is we just have to work harder. So we try as much as we can to walk and chew gum at the same time, to use that colloquialism. The need to deal with the new challenges, our first recourse is just to work harder and work longer hours in order to make sure that we continue with the business as usual.

The other recourse that we have, which is not reflected in here, is to actively recruit additional resource from outside government, and that was the case, I believe -- I think we recruited around 15,000 additional civil servants into government, and I would just sort of note in passing that that again was additional resource that was then subsequently used when --

**Lead Inquiry**: An additional?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: -- Covid struck.

So I just think it's important to contextualise how this fits in with the way in which government tends to work.

**Lead Inquiry**: May we have, please, document INQ000205310.

This was a quarterly update, Deputy Prime Minister, on CCS, civil contingencies activity, which was prepared in fact for you as the then Minister for Implementation, and it's dated January 2019, so INQ000205310, update for the Minister for Implementation, January 2019, and you were of course still the Minister for Implementation at that time, because you remained so until 24 July 2019.

May we have page 2, please:

"Following Cabinet agreement in December we are prioritising no deal preparations from now on. This may include standing up Command, Control and Coordination arrangements for as long as required."

We resume that's a reference to the no-deal preparation arrangements that would need to be stood up.

"[The Civil Contingencies Secretariat] will continue a small number of essential activities alongside no deal preparations but have paused all other activity to enable sufficient focus on preparations for leaving the EU without a deal."

That would appear to indicate, would it not, that in terms of weighing up the balance of activities which were being paused or ceased, the majority of activities were paused to enable focus on preparations for a no-deal exit, and only a minority of activities in the CCS continued for other matters?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, I think it's quite important with this one -- I believe it's the following slide actually makes reference to pandemic flu preparedness, so it may be --

**Lead Inquiry**: It does.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: -- the one afterwards. So that was identified as an area where work could continue.

**Lead Inquiry**: So we will see further down the page, on this page, a reference to the "Emergency Planning College operations", which was an activity to be prioritised, and then the "National Security Risk Assessment ... completion", and we know of course that that risk assessment process was completed in 2019.

So, yes, page 3, there's a reference to:

"Pandemic Flu commitments close to completion finalised, including Pandemic Flu Bill and Excess Deaths Guidance."

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, and --

**Lead Inquiry**: Those are the two areas, are they not, to which you made reference a few moments ago? Are they -- in the middle of the page:

"Pandemic Flu commitments close to completion finalised, including Pandemic Flu Bill and Excess Deaths Guidance."

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, and those were the two principal areas which were allocated to the Cabinet Office under those plan -- under the broader plans for pandemic flu preparedness.

**Lead Inquiry**: But what about all the other pandemic flu-related obligations and recommendations which had come out of Exercise Cygnus? Not just those relating to the drafting of a Pandemic Flu Bill and the workstreams relating to excess deaths guidance, the two workstreams to which you rightly have made reference?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: So this document, and you can see from the list of things, is updating me on things that fell specifically within my departmental brief, so the resilience satellite network, mobile alerting and so on. Clearly under the lead government department model, most of the activity identified under Cygnus to be taken forward fell to the department, DHSC, Department of Health and Social Care. So that's sort of separate to this piece of work that is -- this is updating me on my Cabinet Office responsibilities.

**Lead Inquiry**: The Pandemic Flu Bill and the excess deaths guidance were only a minority, were they not, of the workstreams which were required as a result of Exercise Cygnus and the pandemic flu planning to which the government had committed itself, were they not?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: In respect of my ministerial responsibilities in respect of pandemic flu, we had allocated to the Cabinet Office a small number of responsibilities. The two most significant ones of those were Pandemic Flu Bill and excess deaths guidance. There were a number of other -- a large number of other areas of responsibility allocated to DHSC. I don't believe that this, this deals with the, what fell under DHSC as the lead government department.

**Lead Inquiry**: Well, there was a committee, to which you've already made reference, the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board, which was co-chaired by the Cabinet Office and the DHSC, was it not?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes. First of all, I think it's -- I should say this was not a ministerial committee. I sit on many, many ministerial committees and boards. This was a cross-departmental operational board, and there are many, many such boards that bring together officials. So, for example, in the field of resilience for -- civil nuclear disasters is one, there's many others of them, I was aware and briefed of the board. But the key thing for me was the output out of that board and this, this document, reflects the output out of that board.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did you, as the Cabinet Office minister from July 2019 have responsibility for the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board, a board which was co-chaired by your own department?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: So it was co-chaired by officials in my department, so it's important to -- I did not -- I never sat on that board.

**Lead Inquiry**: No.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: The purpose of that board was to deal with that cross-departmental working. I was briefed on the -- both the existence of the board, and you can see that in some of the other papers, and specifically on the output of those -- of that board, and this document in turn reflects the output of that board. Indeed, I received other briefings that reflected the output of it.

It was a fairly common thing for officials to get together in different groupings to work through issues. This was a sort of standing way of ensuring that that -- that that happened, and then ministers in turn would receive reporting out of it.

**Lead Inquiry**: The board was a board for the cross-departmental working and output, as you describe it, relating to pandemic flu readiness; is that correct?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that's correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes. And it is a board which was centrally concerned with drawing up plans and pursuing workstreams related to what was required to be done in relation to prepare the country for the ordeal of addressing a pandemic flu?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that's correct, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: And it was a board which was within your department, because it was co-chaired by it. To what extent was the work of that board, as opposed to the general work of the Cabinet Office and the CCS, to which this document refers, interrupted by the necessary planning that was required to be done for a no-deal exit?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, I believe that the board -- I think it met in November 2018. Is that -- I think that is correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: That's correct.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Then it subsequently met essentially after Yellowhammer had been stood down, I believe in November or December '19, and then in January 2020 again.

**Lead Inquiry**: So may we take it from that that the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board did not meet from November 2018 to November 2019?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that's correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: Were you told, as the minister in charge of this particular aspect of the Cabinet Office, and as along with many others, that the board had not met for a year and had been, therefore, unable to consider in committee form the workstreams which were intended for it?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, I can't actually see from the documentation that I have or the committee -- sorry, that the Inquiry has, I can't see a specific document informing me of that. I would expect that I would have been informed of it. But I think the more -- for me, the more fundamental point as the minister was: what are the outputs of this process? So essentially, as you can see from that briefing, I was being assured that the core areas for which the Cabinet Office was responsible were continuing. I was also aware that because of Yellowhammer, and I think it was the right thing to do, we were prioritising resources to make sure that we were equipped for a no-deal scenario. And by the way, if we hadn't done that re-prioritisation, we would have been in a much worse position to deal with Covid when it hit had no-deal actually occurred, in terms of medical supplies and so on, and that this was part of a normal re-prioritisation, albeit, I should say, at the more sort of extreme end of re-prioritisation, given the amount of resources we had to dedicate to no-deal, since it wasn't one sector specific, it cut across many different areas.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is extreme re-prioritisation a metaphor for significant impact? The re-prioritisation that took place here, extreme as you describe it, in effect meant that an important committee dealing with pandemic flu readiness did not meet, and the majority of the workstreams to which the Cabinet Office refer in a general sense, but specifically in the context of pandemic flu planning, were interfered with, they were either paused or only part completed or stopped altogether, with the exception of excess death capacity management and the drafting of a pandemic Bill?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: I don't think there is a great deal I can add to what I previously said. I disagree with the point about the significant impact, because of the reassurances that I received, and I've made the point about how those pertained to -- those specific recommendations pertained to the Cabinet Office.

It is the case that across all government activity, and bearing in mind this is one of 90-odd different areas of activity where re-prioritisation, I'm sure, would have happened across those risks in many other areas, the assurance that I had, and indeed to my knowledge I didn't ever receive a document -- and believe me as a minister I frequently receive documents from officials that say to me, "Minister, this is a major problem, we need to do something about it"; I did not receive that in respect of the situation with the pandemic flu board.

The pandemic flu board, there was an official level cross-government co-ordination body, and as part of the shifting of resources to deal with this major challenge of no-deal as it arose, that didn't meet -- that is not to say that activities didn't happen, they clearly happened here. And also in respect of other areas, they'd been commissioned -- they weren't sort of stood down, they -- as it were, we'd made progress in a lot of areas, and in those key areas for which I had responsibility, the prioritisation continued.

**Mr Keith**: All right, thank you.

My Lady, is that a convenient moment?

**Lady Hallett**: Certainly.

I'm sorry we have to keep you over lunch. I know you have so many things to do -- well, we've been hearing about some of the things you have had to do -- but I'm afraid I have to break regularly because the poor stenographer has to cope with everything you say.

And I gather you've still got a little bit to go?

**Mr Keith**: Not much, but some.

**Lady Hallett**: So I hope it's not too inconvenient, and I hope you can work over the break.

I shall return at 1.50.

**Mr Keith**: Thank you.

*(12.51 pm)*

*(The short adjournment)*

*(1.50 pm)*

**Mr Keith**: Deputy Prime Minister, before lunch you were giving evidence about the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board. I would like to take you, please, to another Pandemic Flu Readiness Board document, INQ000023114, please.

So the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board, as we've seen, was a board chaired in fact by the Cabinet Office and the DHSC, it was a joint board, and therefore a board, of course, into which both the Cabinet Office and the DHSC contributed.

This document is dated 23 January 2020, so it's dated in fact about three weeks before you ceased being Minister for the Cabinet Office.

We can see it's a PFRB document, because in the top right-hand corner you will see the reference to the board, "PFRB". What it is is it's a dashboard of the workstreams coming out of the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board as at that date, 23 January 2020.

I'd like you, please, Deputy Prime Minister, to have a look down the "Progress since the last meeting", which is the second column, and the "Next Steps", as well as the "Key Risks", in the last column, briefly in relation to each of the workstreams, and consider to the extent to which you were aware of the progress or lack of progress for each of the workstreams.

So, the first one is healthcare:

"Progress has slowed due to extended sickness of the NHS England Pandemic Flu Lead, EU Exit activities and the reorganisation of NHS England ..."

In "Next Steps":

"Draft strategy to be signed off ...

"Consideration of the communications ...

"Further development of the service facing guidance ...

"Lessons from EU Exit planning will be reflected."

And the "Key Risks", the possibility of:

"Further major incidents in London ...

"Competing demands on key NHS [England]/[Improvement] staff.

"NHS [England]/[Improvement] change of priorities ..."

Were you aware prior to leaving ministerial office, that that degree of progress had been made in relation to the workstream of healthcare in relation to the committee which the Cabinet Office co-chaired?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, the first thing I should say, Mr Keith, is clearly under the departmental lead model, lead government departmental model, these actions pertained to the Department of Health, so the -- my expectation is those would have been reported through to the Department of Health, through their appropriate processes.

As I said in my evidence prior to the break, the purpose of this board was to bring together two different bits of government at official level and I would have been advised, and indeed was advised, on the outputs, as we discussed.

So I wouldn't have expected to have been briefed specifically on this. It could have been that I would have done subsequently, but, given those timings, I suspect by the time we'd gone through the process of the board sitting, then the subs and so on, the advice coming up to ministers, I doubt that would come across my desk by the time I'd left.

**Lead Inquiry**: Deputy Prime Minister, it's obvious that not every document goes to the desk of a minister, and you've already made plain that this is a committee which was concerned with workstreams that traversed not just the Cabinet Office but the DHSC. It was a joint Cabinet Office/DHSC committee.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: And I believe other departments as well may have had outputs from it as well.

**Lead Inquiry**: They may have had outputs, but it was a committee that was co-chaired by your department?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that's correct, it was co-chaired by officials in my department, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: The Pandemic Flu Readiness Board was a board for which you, together with the Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care, took ministerial responsibility?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes. It was a way of ensuring that we had joined-up and -- government between different parts of the government machine, just as, for example, in relation to, say, civil nuclear preparedness, there were similar boards.

But this was about driving the operationalisation of the direction that the government was taking.

**Lead Inquiry**: Number 2 workstream, community care:

"Progress on the community healthcare side has slowed due to extended sickness of NHS [England] Pandemic Flu Lead, EU Exit activities and the re-organisation of NHS [England]/[NHS improvement]."

Then over the page, please, "Excess Deaths", that is the workstream to which you made reference, isn't it, this morning?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes. That was one that was specifically allocated to the Cabinet Office.

**Lead Inquiry**: "Workshops have been held for Body Disposal, Body Transport, Body Storage, Coroners and Prisons."

Prisons was another area that the Cabinet Office was particularly concerned with, and that appears to be a workstream that was proceeded with.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, that would reflect the fact, again, of the co-ordination and facilitation role of government working with the Minister of Justice, it would have been at that time.

**Lead Inquiry**: Then over the page, please, "Sector Resilience":

"There has been no further work on this work stream as the statements of preparedness are finalised, and it was agreed that the sharing of the business checklist should be paused as a result of the need to communicate other risks, including EU Exit.

So sector resilience, what is that?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: So it's sort of what it says on the tin. That is, for different parts of society and the nation, their ability to withstand. So, for example, you might have the transport sector, you might have the education sector. It's chunks of the economy and national life. And resilience is -- clearly that's ability to withstand.

**Lead Inquiry**: It's an important part.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yeah. And again, that would reflect the fact that sector resilience is something that cuts across different parts of government, so again it goes back to this facilitation and co-ordination.

**Lead Inquiry**: But it includes health sector resilience, of course?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, of course, except that what I would say is that this is clearly demark -- health sector is the core sector for the impact of pandemic flu, so sort of implicit in that is that, given that DHSC was jointly chairing this board, that -- that would sit with them. I mean, so it's a sort of -- it's a somewhat academic distinction.

In theory, I guess, health would sit within it, but manifestly given the actual facts of where this -- how government worked together, given that health were responsible, as you can see, for many of these other areas, I don't think we would have gone through a process whereby it went: Cabinet Office, back to Health, liaison, engage. Given that Health were already liaising and engaging through this forum.

**Lead Inquiry**: Well, it was plainly an important workstream otherwise it wouldn't have appeared on the face of this document?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, it was, and that's -- but the role of Cabinet -- the reason I think Cabinet Office had this allocated to it is the fact that dealing with all the other government departments that were not represented at this board would have required the usual role of Cabinet Office to facilitate and liaise with them. There would have been a need for the Cabinet Office to facilitate and lead with the Department of Health, since they were sat round the table when they went through all these other actions.

**Lead Inquiry**: The only official whose name appears on this document, in the first column, is of the senior resilience officer, [name redacted], at the Civil Contingencies Secretariat within the Cabinet Office, which was your department?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that's correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

Number 5, "Cross Cutting Enablers". Is this a reference to the work that was done on the draft pandemic Bill, which in due course formed the basis of the Coronavirus Act of 2020?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, I think that is the case, if you look here in the second column across it says:

"All England clauses and supporting documentation ... including explanatory note and assessment of impacts."

Those are things typically associated with the process of drawing up legislation.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes, and we can see a reference to "Legislative" in the first column, and also in the last column, the right-hand column --

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, indeed --

**Lead Inquiry**: -- the future risk may be a failure to complete the Bill?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. So that's one of the areas to which you referred earlier in relation to which work continued and it was completed?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: And indeed that is reflected in the --

**Lead Inquiry**: Over the page, please.

"Communications ...

"Pandemic Influenza Public Health Communications Strategy content signed off by the four [United Kingdom Chief Medical Officers] ... Work stream then paused."

Do you know why the workstream was then paused?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: No, I don't, is the short answer. I could speculate that it was to do with our previous discussion about --

**Lead Inquiry**: Operation Yellowhammer?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: -- Operation Yellowhammer, but I couldn't say for sure one way or the other.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. Then we've got the "Moral and Ethical ... Advisory Group". Is that the group that was instituted in order to be able tackle the extremely difficult moral and ethical issues which might arise out of triage decisions having to be made by hospitals, in essence the turning away of patients for treatment?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Amongst other things, yes.

So this arose from a consideration that government would have to make difficult decisions and we would have to -- it would -- as, again, the title suggests, it would give rise to moral and ethical questions, and we felt it was appropriate to have a body to help us with that. Indeed, I signed off the creation of the Moral and Ethical Advisory Group as a minister, and I believe, certainly in a previous pack, there was a sub that had details of that.

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed. And it had had one introductory meeting, on 25 October of 2019, and there was a debate about its remit. So that structure, that committee was set up and they had one introductory meeting.

Further down the page, please, over the page, "Year 2 workstreams".

There is then a reference to this, the 2011 UK Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Strategy, as it says, the document dating back to 2011.

The review was complete and commission sent to stakeholders requesting relevant sections are updated.

"A number of updates [have been] received. Not taken on board as workstream paused. Aware of the need to reignite this workstream."

Was that strategy document, the 2011 strategy document, the sole pandemic-related strategy document in existence? It relates to pandemic influenza, it was the only one related to pandemic influenza, and there was no analogous strategy document for non-influenza pandemics; is that correct?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, I -- I would imagine that that was the case, but I have to say, I just want to be absolutely clear with the Inquiry, that under the lead government departmental model, these actions, the ones -- you can see from my answers I'm able to answer very clearly on the ones that pertain to Cabinet Office responsibilities. These pertain to Department of Health responsibilities. The lens through which I saw all of this was the NRSA and its successor documents, and ensuring we had the cross-government co-ordination. Indeed this is reflected in this body and many other bodies.

So I'm sure that was the case but I can't say that definitively to you, because the strategies that I was concerning myself with were all the things that facilitated and made government work together, and we can see that more recently with things like the Resilience Framework, the various iterations of the standards that were required across government, the risk registers, and so on.

Just as with the Home Office, for example, when -- you know, Home Office leads on counterterror. I wouldn't tend to get to the detail of each -- being sort of cognisant in the detail of each individual strategy. So that's why I'm a little bit reluctant to say for certain.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: But plainly it would appear on the face of it that that would be the case.

**Lead Inquiry**: As the Minister for the Cabinet Office and in charge of resilience, civil contingencies, the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, and the planning cross-government, through the Cabinet Office, of pandemic influenza preparedness, do you recall whether you were aware of the significance of that 2011 document? Do you recall debate about that document or the need to update it, to refresh it, or was that something that just didn't come to you as a Cabinet Office minister?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: I think this primarily sat with the Department of Health. It was their document. In order to ensure the effective delivery of government. Indeed, this is one of the challenges that I find constantly as a Cabinet Office minister, it's to know where to delineate the line between the individual government department and cross-government action. The last thing that government departments want is another government department trying to do the same thing as that department. Indeed, the purpose of this board would partly have been to de-conflict and to make sure, like, we're clear this sits with one bit of government, that sits with another bit of government. Indeed, that is reflected in the allocation of workstreams in the first column of this. Indeed, I should say this is fairly standard modus operandi of government, that you have the overall direction set, ministers are updated, and then you have -- and ministers ask questions and all those other things that we discussed prior to the break, but then you have a sort of mechanism for making sure the two bits of government work together, and this is what this board was doing.

**Lead Inquiry**: But, Mr Dowden, the DHSC in the field of civil contingencies and health emergencies is the lead government department, but the Cabinet Office still retains its obligation to ensure that the wheels of government turn, there is proper co-ordination and liaison between departments, and that all the moving parts of the health emergency civil contingencies system continued to turn.

The Cabinet Office at no time absolved itself of the obligation to ensure that the DHSC was on top of its areas concerned with civil contingencies, in the same way that the Cabinet Office was on top of its obligations and other government departments were on top of their obligations.

Where is the material which shows that, ministerially, the Cabinet Office was trying to drive this process forward, and saying, "There are gaps here, there have been pauses in the workstreams, we, the civil contingencies department, must try to resolve this"?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, I think there's -- I sort of make two reflections on this. So, first of all, this is important that we have a lead government departmental model, and that each department takes its responsibility -- and by the way, it's not as if this thing sort of sits there. That is a clear action that is allocated to a senior responsible officer, basically a lead civil servant in that department. They then fit in a structure where they will, no doubt, report to a director general or a -- probably a director general Or a director and then in to a permanent secretary. Those -- and then ministers in that department have accountability for that and oversee it and drive it.

The separate role of the Cabinet Office is to say, "Right, how do we make sure all the different bits of government work together?" So, for example, if it was the case that the Department of Health came to us, either at ministerial level or through officials, and said, "Look, we've got a problem trying to deliver this strategy, we need to get" -- I don't know -- "Department for Transport", or some other department, "in order to make this happen, we're not getting the movement we require", then they would come to officials in my department, potentially ministers would come to me, and say, "Look, can you unblock this, can you help make this happen?"

My first question would usually be: have you exhausted all the things that you can do yourself? And if you can't, then we will use the machinery of government to help achieve that. What is not a good use of resource for us is to constantly second-guess things that are clearly allocated to individual government departments.

**Lead Inquiry**: But what about checking workstreams directly coming out of a committee which your department co-chairs?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: So if there was a significant problem in respect of this, I would expect to be, and frequently was, updated -- remember this is a non-ministerial board, this is an officials -- I would have expected to receive advice, to be informed that there was a problem -- (a) there was a problem here and (b) that it was a problem that required Cabinet Office to facilitate, help unlock and so on, in the way that I've described to you.

**Lead Inquiry**: These problems did not emerge for the first time on 23 January 2020. When were you, therefore, updated and informed of the continuing problems with this process and the majority of the workstreams?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: I can't recall now, I'm sure it's -- it would be in a -- one of the documents, obviously. I don't actually recall in the documents you've showed me -- indeed, Mr Keith, I'm very happy to look at it -- one that specifically referred to this point.

**Lead Inquiry**: The reason I ask is that, of course, in your statement you say:

"I was briefed that there was a major programme of work underway to improve readiness across government ..."

"... I was generally assured that the Government was reasonably and sufficiently prepared for an influenza pandemic ... [and] I [was] broadly content that the Government took reasonable and proportionate steps commensurate with the perceived risks at the time."

It is your assertions in your witness statement that form the genesis for questions about the degree to which you were informed about the problems apparent on the face of this document.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, and the reason why I said that is that -- and I can point throughout the bundles that the Inquiry has, where I am reassured about the progress that has been made in respect of pandemic flu preparedness, and indeed if you go back to one of these previous items -- I'm not asking to scroll back up, just to recall there -- at the time I received, for example, the submission on the medical ethical and advisory group, that also had a couple of annexes attached to it, which again provided updates and reassurance -- indeed, I believe in one of these documents there is a line saying "We're one of the best prepared in the world".

Secondly, as we developed, as sort of workstreams are shifted and adjusted in the way that we were discussing prior to the break, I received updates on those. So that is the basis on which I made that assertion.

Remember, of course, all of this is being done in the context of the information that I had at that time. Of course if you now ask me with the hindsight of everything that happened subsequently, I can go into many discussions about what happened afterwards. What I was trying to convey in that statement was about my assurance as to where we were at that point, given the material that I'd received as a minister and all the information that I had as a minister at that time.

**Lead Inquiry**: This is not hindsight, is it? Because this is a document dated 23 January, produced while you were still a minister, on the eve of the pandemic, and these -- it's a reflection of workstreams that were running into problems and being paused or stopped over a matter of months, in fact 18 months prior to the pandemic.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, the first thing is that, as I said, I didn't receive an update on this. I may well have received an update and my answer to you may have been different had I received that update.

Secondly, this was the -- under a lead government departmental model, one would expect that those issues would primarily be raised to the relevant lead government department, which was the Department for Health. Indeed, on the assertion that these individual things had that significant impact subsequently, again I've not -- I've not seen the evidence of that.

**Lead Inquiry**: No, indeed.

Could we just then conclude this document by just having a look at the bottom row:

"Restructure of the Online Pandemic Influenza Documentation/Guidance.

"This work stream was paused as a result of EU Exit."

If you just go over the page, we may see the continuation and conclusion of the first sentence in the first column:

"[Government] UK and Resilience Direct."

Then:

"LRF Pandemic Flu Standard.

"The consultation on the Pan Flu Standard ..."

Which is a -- is that a testing document for local resilience forums? That was completed.

Could we then look, and you're quite right, of course, there were any number of documents after the event, but they look backwards and they shed light on the position prior to the pandemic.

INQ000057522, this was a document which concerned the implementation of the recommendations that came out of Exercise Cygnus, to which you referred. Just to recollect the position, Cygnus was an exercise in October 2016, was it not? It reported in July 2017, and thereafter, over the following three years, work was done in order to implement the recommendations from Exercise Cygnus.

Because Exercise Cygnus was an exercise in which the Cabinet Office was a participant organisation, to what extent, whilst a minister, were you informed about the progress being made on the implementation of the recommendations from Exercise Cygnus? Generally. Not just those specifically concerned with the Cabinet Office, but generally as a result of the exercise.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, first of all, I should say in respect of this document, I don't believe I was presented with this document when --

**Lead Inquiry**: No, you wouldn't have been.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: -- because it's a Department of Health document --

**Lead Inquiry**: And it's dated June 2020, after you've ceased being --

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: So that's an important piece of context for this document.

Secondly, the core role of the Cabinet Office in respect of any exercise is to make the thing happen. So, for example, very recently my department and I oversaw Operation Mighty Oak, which was to prepare us for the eventuality if we lost power in the United Kingdom, something that I'm sure is -- we won't worry about it, as a consequence of it -- or we had the appropriate actions.

So that's what the Cabinet Office was doing in terms of pulling that together. Under the lead government departmental model, and I have subsequently seen this document, you will see again, in common with the pandemic flu board recommendations, under each row there's an allocation of those to each government department.

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Those that pertain to the Cabinet Office, again, I had comfort that those were being conducted in the appropriate way.

It was not the case -- and I suppose this is the -- maybe, Mr Keith, this is the fundamental point that you are getting at with these questions, that -- I as a minister had 90-odd different risks that sat specifically identified in the NRSA within the resilience portfolio. In addition to that there were many other risks that we had to deal with.

Within that context, my responsibility was to make sure all the different bits of government were working together in terms of the overall strategy, not necessarily to dive into the detail of each one of those 90-odd risks, except if I was being advised that there was a specific problem that I -- that required my support in terms of dealing with it.

In terms of how the Cygnus then came through to this, the outcome of Cygnus was then embedded into actions that were being driven through government. So the relevant ones for the health department were embedded into the health department, and as we've seen and discussed in previous exchanges, those in relation to the Cabinet Office were embedded in the Cabinet Office --

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: -- the excess deaths and so on.

**Lead Inquiry**: We can see from this document that it refers to the fact that Exercise Cygnus demonstrated four key learning outcomes for the United Kingdom's preparedness and response capabilities, and of course you will recall that Exercise Cygnus reported that the United Kingdom's preparedness and response in terms of its plans, policies and capability were not sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic.

The report was supported by 22 detailed lessons:

"This analysis maps the 22 lessons identified against policy and planning development activities undertaken by the [whole of the United Kingdom] Government and Devolved Administrations through:

"- The Pandemic Flu Readiness Board ..."

The Body chaired by the Cabinet Office and the DHSC.

"- The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Programme ..."

Supervised by the DHSC.

"- normal 'business-as-usual' activities of those organisations with a role in pandemic preparedness."

Paragraph 4:

"Overall, the analysis has found that:

"- eight lessons identified have been fully addressed by Government;

"- six lessons identified have been partially address by the development of new plans and policies, but some work is ongoing; and

"- work to address eight lessons identified is still ongoing."

So this is June 2020, almost four years -- three and a half years after Exercise Cygnus.

What you say about risks, outcomes, workstreams being assigned to a particular government department is well understood, but which government department stood back and, with an overarching eye, asked the question: what generally is happening with the recommendations to Exercise Cygnus to cover the possibility that each department focused on its own specific workstreams? And no one took charge to drive the overall process forward to make sure that no one was falling between two stools.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: So the process by which this worked was each one of those actions was, and I believe in the subsequent pages you will see it, allocated to an individual government department. Those government departments have structures with them, and I see it within the Cabinet Office, to ensure that they deliver on the areas for which they are responsible.

So if you take those allocated to the Department of Health, there are senior responsible officers who have responsibility for those within the Department of Health. They sit within reporting structures within the Department of Health, whereby they're held to account for those things.

The whole purpose of having an SRO is to say: we're not going to have this confusion, this is the person to whose name this particular responsibility is attached.

Now, in respect of those which were attached to the Cabinet Office, those were clearly addressed in the way that we've discussed previously.

In addition to that, the facilitating role of the Cabinet Office was to say -- if the department came to us and had problems with delivery of it, they would raise them. In addition to that, it's not -- that was the preponderance of how it happened, but it was also the case that there were many officials within the CCS. They didn't sort of say, "There we are, over you go and, you know, forget about it". There was an ongoing dialogue. But the responsibility was very clearly set out, as set out in the different rows of that document.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

May we please have that document removed, and replaced by the Resilience Framework for which you took responsibility. You drafted the foreword to it, by virtue of your subsequent ministerial position as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, which post you held from October 2022, and therefore includes the framework document INQ000097685 of December 2022.

Do you recognise that document?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, I do.

**Lead Inquiry**: I'm going to embarrass you, Deputy Prime Minister, by asking you to just check that the foreword and the photograph is indeed of you and from you on page 7.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: I'll wait for it to flash up on the screen.

**Lead Inquiry**: There we are.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, it's a passing resemblance, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: This document was a document prepared by the government, with obvious good sense, in light of many of the lessons learned documents which have emanated from the Covid pandemic, as well as, of course, the reviews carried out by various departments concerned with civil contingencies, and also it was a document promised in, I think, a major government review in 2021 called the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy.

The Inquiry would just like to explore briefly some of the commitments which had been made in the report, because of course it forms no part of this Inquiry's functions and my Lady's functions to make recommendations which have already been put in place or are being progressed.

So just briefly looking at the annex, which I think is at -- no, perhaps let's start on page 5, which is the executive summary. You can see there that the report is divided up between the executive summary and the action plans in relation to risk, responsibilities and accountability, partnerships, communities, investment and skills. Annex B, there is a summary on page 66, it's page 72 online, could we have that, please, which sets out a summary of the framework actions which your report promotes.

The first page of annex B deals with those actions in respect of which the United Kingdom Government is already taking action. So in relation to risk, it's already taking action by refreshing the NSRA process. Indeed in 2022 the NSRA process was revised, was it not, to take account of the possibility of multiple scenarios?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes, that's correct. Indeed, shortly we will publish the -- sorry to get into all these acronyms, but the NRR, which is the public-facing version of --

**Lead Inquiry**: The National Risk Register, the public-facing emanation of the National Security Risk Assessment.

Then creating a new head of resilience, so the United Kingdom Government is already taking action by creating a new head of resilience.

May we task you, please, with the question: has a new head of resilience been appointed?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that a post within a government department or is it a post outwith a government department?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: It's a post within a government department. It's a post within the Cabinet Office. So one of the principal post-Covid reforms we have undertaken is to take the previous CCS, so Civil Contingencies Secretariat, and deal with one of the challenges, which is: how do you balance dealing with immediate crises as they hit whilst continuing to ensure the wider resilience picture?

So, am I at liberty to name -- it might just help to --

**Lead Inquiry**: By all means.

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: So Roger Hargreaves now runs the COBR unit. That is the crisis unit to deal with issues as they immediately emerge. So in the short term. So we don't lose sight of the longer-term challenges, Mary Jones oversees and indeed is head of resilience. They -- just in terms of the overall architecture of the Cabinet Office, they sit in slightly different reporting structures, so Mary sits within -- and forgive me, these are further details -- EDS, the economic and domestic secretariat, which is the overall cross-government co-ordination function. Roger sits primarily within the NSS, the National Security Secretariat, which reflects those slightly different preponderances. One is about joining up whole of government in form of resilience, one is about the immediate crisis response.

**Lead Inquiry**: There was, before this Resilience Framework and before the full terrible impact of Covid-19 became apparent, already a director of national resilience in the Cabinet Office, a full-time job, between March 2020 and May 2022.

To what extent is this new head of resilience any different to the pre-existing job of being director of national resilience in the Cabinet Office?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: So the principal difference is the split that I described to you, namely between the -- ensuring that we have both the focus on the challenges as they hit, the immediate management of those, and taking the longer-term risk -- the longer-term view. Also I would say, the other thing that does -- and this runs through the framework -- is looking at how we try and prevent these things happening in the first place, so the sort of strategies like the Biological Security Strategy, actions in relation to critical national infrastructure resilience, resilience to cyber, net zero strategies, all of those cross-government efforts that ensure that these crises don't happen in the first place, as well as the resilience for when they do.

**Lead Inquiry**: In relation to the new resilience function, in the third bullet point, the government's already taking action by:

"Strengthening [the] UK Government resilience structures by creating a new resilience function ..."

Before the split in the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, between the new COBR unit -- which is now in the National Security Secretariat --

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: No, sorry, forgive me, so the COBR unit is the COBR unit, it reports into the national security --

**Lead Inquiry**: It is in the --

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: -- part of the national security --

**Lead Inquiry**: It is in the National Security Secretariat, and the other half of the old Civil Contingencies Secretariat is the Resilience Directorate, which is now in the economic and domestic secretariat.

So what extent does this new resilience function differ from half of the old Civil Contingencies Secretariat, namely the Resilience Directorate, which is now in the economic and domestic secretariat?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, I think one of the problems that we identified previously, and what we're seeking to address with this, is the tendency for the person that has overall charge of this to permanently be focused on the immediate risks and not to take that longer-term view. And I have actually seen this in action both as a minister before and afterwards. I now have totally separate meetings, regularly, with Mary Jones, who is the -- I'm referring to her from now on as the head of resilience -- who is briefing me on where we are with resilience and prevention, whereas Roger Hargreaves, as head of COBR, is the person that is briefing me on ensuring that we are across the immediate challenges we face, such as -- you know, the Sudan evacuation was one of the more prominent recent challenges that we faced.

So I think in that way you ensure that one doesn't become the sort of poorer relation of the other.

**Lead Inquiry**: Page 73, please. The framework distinguishes, does it not, between those steps in relation to which the United Kingdom government is already taking action and those actions which the government is committing to take by 2025, that's on page 73, and, page 74, by 2030.

I want to ask you, please, about one particular aspect of page 73, the roles which will be put in place by 2025, halfway down the page, partnerships, because the degree of external review, of challenge, of advice antithetic to groupthink, is an important issue for this Inquiry.

The government has agreed to:

"Grow[ing] the United Kingdom's advisory groups made up of experts, academics and industry experts in order to inform the NSRA. This may include establishing a risk-focused sub-group of the UK Resilience Forum."

In drawing up the report, Deputy Prime Minister, what did you have in mind in relation to what those external experts, academics and industry experts might consist of, given that the report in its body makes plain that SAGE will continue to play a vital role, the United Kingdom Resilience Forum is already set up, the provision for a body called STACs will continue to provide expert advice, and that the government will actively and regularly draw on expert challenge.

Do you know what exactly is in mind in terms of growing those groups rather than relying upon the existing structures?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Well, there's a short answer and a long answer. To give you the long answer I'd have to go through each of those different bodies that you listed and explain to you the specific functions. The short version of that is that I don't believe that any of those body performed specifically the function of an external look and challenge across resilience.

So just to take one, SAGE was -- is particularly in relation to biological security risks and particularly in the health sector. They wouldn't have much to say -- I wouldn't think they'd have anything to say in relation to a severe terrorist incident. They might have something to say in relation to, say, civil, nuclear. So the idea is to create some further external challenge.

Indeed, for me as a minister, and I find this in conversation with other ministers, and I think you've probably heard in evidence, and I saw briefly in the evidence of Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the most important challenges for us as ministers is to know what the right questions are to ask in the first place, and the more divergent forms of opinions and views you can get, the better able you are to ask the right questions.

So within this Resilience Forum, which, as you said earlier, I chair, I think there is value in trying to take -- so the Resilience Forum at the moment is about kind of pulling together, as it were, all the different strands in line with the whole-of-society approach that's outlined in this strategy. That would be about providing the sort of challenge inward, as it were.

So I think there is value in doing that. Although I would say that I have -- you know, I've tried to keep up to date as much as I can with the deliberations of this Inquiry and I think some valid points have been made about other routes for finding that external challenge, so we'll certainly look to the outcome of Module 1 to see what your recommendations are in that respect.

**Mr Keith**: Thank you very much.

Questions From the Chair

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Dowden, as far as the head of resilience is concerned, what level of official is it?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: Director.

**Lady Hallett**: She?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: She is a director.

**Lady Hallett**: She reports to a minister in the Cabinet Office that happens to you at the moment, or to the Deputy Prime Minister, if there is one? To whom does she report officially?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: She reports to -- well, she's available for all ministers to meet with, but she will report to me, not -- Deputy Prime Minister is sort of to one side -- as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is the lead minister in the department. Indeed, I meet very regularly with Mary Jones, as you might imagine.

**Lady Hallett**: Given the number of responsibilities that you referred to very briefly, and I heard from Sir Oliver Letwin, do you think there may be an argument for saying that there needs to be a minister whose specific responsibility is resilience?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: I think it's a very interesting argument, and I -- you know, I saw Oliver's evidence quite late last night, so forgive me if I didn't catch every nuance of it, but I can see the argument he's making. The thing I would just say to consider on the other side is two-fold.

First of all, if you try and pull out resilience from all the other cross-government co-ordination that happens in Cabinet Office, I think you'd lose something from that. So, for example, I'm able to link across, for example, the intelligence I receive on the NSS side, in terms of malicious threats, and indeed that is very relevant to resilience now in the context, for example, of the Russia/Ukraine developments that we've seen over the past year or so. I'm also able to link it across to the Government Commercial Function, which sits within my department, and they in turn link through to each of the commercial functions of each department.

So I don't think you -- if you took all of it and transferred it across, you'd basically be saying, "Have me", as it were, and -- I mean, I think that on balance it probably works better to have a senior minister, and I'm fortunate enough to have been appointed senior minister now, overseeing all of this.

To the other point that Oliver made, I think he made the point about having the Prime Minister's ear, being able to influence. There would inevitably be a very limited number of ministers who were able to have that kind of access to the Prime Minister. So you may well find that there could be a trade-off there, not necessarily, but I would just be concerned about how enduring that would be. So it could well be the case that when the minister was first appointed they would be somebody that the Prime Minister, you know, knew well and placed a lot of trust in. You could find over the course of reshuffles they became a less significant minister. It is always the case that the Cabinet Office is a core government department, and the role of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, certainly for the past 20 or 30 years, has tended to be held by a senior minister, and I think that would be the thing I would weigh up in considerations.

**Lady Hallett**: One last question. You've said a number of times, as is bound to be the case, that you rely on assurances that you get and briefings that you get from officials. How do you as a minister make sure that they're not marking their own homework?

**Mr Oliver Dowden**: It's a very good question. It goes back actually to the last exchanges, which was about one of the biggest challenges as a minister is knowing the right questions to ask. So all ministers rely on external input. I would say external input I rely on is first of all think tank reports, reports from all the numerous learned institutes, questions that are posed to me in Parliament, I shall, you know, for -- I shall have the joy of questions in Parliament tomorrow on the Cabinet Office and I will make sure that I'm across all the issues that are going to be raised there. That will almost certainly give rise to some external challenge, which I then put back into the system. It's also the case that there is from time to time quite considerable media interest in it. I will always make sure that if I'm going to be questioned on these things I know where we are, and when I get the responses, I will frequently say, "Well, hang on, how does that thing match up with the other thing?"

I've always taken the view that I welcome more external challenge. I think a diversity of views and opinions helps make for more robust decision-making and a minister that's empowered with a greater diversity of ideas is able to better perform as a minister.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

Mr Keith?

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, there are no questions under Rule 10(4) for which you have granted permission, so that concludes the evidence of the Deputy Prime Minister.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister, thank you for helping the Inquiry.

**The Witness**: Thank you, my Lady.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, the next witness is the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

**Lady Hallett**: We're going to have to break, obviously, in the middle, so can you -- we started at 1.50. So the break would probably be at about five past, ten past.

**Mr Keith**: Certainly, my Lady.

Yes, please.
