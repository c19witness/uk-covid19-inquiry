*PROFESSOR MATTHEW KEELING (affirmed).*

Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Mr O'Connor**: Thank you, Professor. Do sit down. Could you give us your full name, please.

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yeah, Matthew James Keeling.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Professor, you have prepared a witness statement at our request for the Inquiry. We see it on screen. At the end of the statement -- again we don't need to go to it -- you've signed the statement underneath the statement of truth saying that you believe that the facts it contains are true, and your signature was made on 5 July of this year; is that right?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: That's correct, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Professor, you are a professor of mathematics and life sciences at the University of Warwick, I think?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yep.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And you also explain in your witness statement that you are, I think, the director or possibly a director of the Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology and Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research at the University of Warwick as well?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In a couple of sentences, tell us something about the work of that institute?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Okay. I mean, it's a large institute, so it's also in some ways virtual, so we don't have a specific membership but we do have individuals that are sort of highly connected with it and interact fully, and it spans people who are interested in using quantitative tools to address challenges in biology, and this is everything from sort of cellular biology and genetics through to a large range of different problems in infectious diseases, everything from sort of childhood diseases such as measles through to human papillomavirus or HPV, Mpox --

**Lady Hallett**: More slowly.

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Sorry.

**Mr Keith**: I know. I appreciate we've got a time limit, but we have to remember the stenographer.

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Sorry. So, yeah, human papilloma virus, monkeypox and then also livestock infections. So we cover a huge gamut of work.

**Mr O'Connor**: Mathematical modelling of that whole range you just gave us of epidemiological issues?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So, as we'll hear, Covid was well within the range of the type of work that you were already doing?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yes, I'd say that's a good ... yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You joined SPI-M in early 2009, so by the time of the pandemic you had been a member for over ten years. Did that make you one of the longer serving members or not?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: I believe Neil Ferguson and John Edmunds were on at around the same time. I believe they were both members when I joined, but they'd only recently become members. So I'd also sort of been there when we'd gone through the 2009 swine flu outbreak, so that gave a sense of perspective.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, and in fact you say that you were the acting or an acting chair of the committee in 2009 at the time of the swine flu pandemic.

During the Covid pandemic, you were an active member of SPI-M-O, but you weren't a regular attender at SAGE. I think you did attend it on a few occasions but, unlike Professor Medley, you weren't there routinely?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I want to ask you about a few of the matters you've raised in your witness statement, Professor Keeling, and the first of them is what you describe as the JUNIPER consortium. So it's paragraph 10 of your witness statement where you start to describe this.

Perhaps you can tell us in your own words: it was I think a consortium that was formed during the pandemic, perhaps quite early on, I think in, you say, the spring of 2020; is that right?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yes, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And it was a coming together of epidemiological modelling academics from a number of different British universities?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yeah, there were seven different universities represented.

**Counsel Inquiry**: At a later stage in your witness statement you talk about the fact that the sort of the field and SPI-M also had a very, a significant representation first of all from what we know we should call the London School, and secondly from Imperial College London, and was this consortium that you call JUNIPER an attempt, if you like, to gather together other universities who on their own had a much smaller presence, but working together could work at scale in the same way as those other two institutions?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Basically, yes, I mean, we wanted to sort of balance out the skills that we'd got, and I think also by having a large number of different universities we could tap into pools of other expertise as well, which I think helped.

**Counsel Inquiry**: There was, you describe in your statement, a problem with the funding for the consortium, which took several months to sort out. Should we see that as just one of those things in university life, or is it more fundamental and a matter that this Inquiry should sort of address?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: I mean, I think it's more just one of those things that happens. We're all used to not getting funding on occasions, and things just taking longer than they should do. I mean, as soon as we got the funding we were able to do more, but we were pulling together before that as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: One of the advantages of the JUNIPER consortium that you describe in your statement is being able to access regional data, and I take it you mean data from the regions represented by the different universities; is that right?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yeah. So, I mean, we were certainly talking to local health charities -- local health trusts, and I know the same was true of the Manchester group, they were very involved with their local health centres. So I think that gave us a different perspective. Just being outside London sort of quite often means that you view things quite differently.

**Counsel Inquiry**: It does, though, raise the question of whether you need to be at a university in Exeter or Warwick to get hold of regional data relating to those areas or whether -- I mean, one might expect that data of that sort is available to modellers, if it needs to be, anyway?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: I think the data's available, I think what you lack is the perspective of actually going and being able to talk to the public health people who are on the ground, who will have a slightly different perspective to what is just in the data. So I think you just get a richer sense of what's happening.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Now, I think I'm right in saying, Professor, that all of the universities that were part of the JUNIPER consortium were from England. Is that right?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You may have heard us asking Professor Medley about how modelling works with regard to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. First of all, have you got anything to add to what he said? But, secondly, was it in your mind that the JUNIPER exercise might include the devolved nations or not?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: I would say we didn't actively exclude them, it wasn't that we wanted this to be an England-only grouping, I think it was more of a sort of circumstance of what was happening. Individuals who were working in comparative areas within SPI-M-O just came together and it just happened to be various people from England. But it's worth saying that I think a lot of us were also involved with work that was going on in the devolved nations, so I attended the Welsh TAG several times and spoke to them at quite long length, I also did quite a lot of work with the Scottish, so Public Health Scotland, trying to understand when they were seeing sort of anomalous rises in cases in local areas. So I don't think we had this dominated English point of view, I think we were all working across the devolved nations.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

I want to ask you one other further question about the imbalance, if you like, or at least the dominance on SPI-M-O of the London School and Imperial College.

In the questionnaire response, the initial questionnaire response that you provided to the Inquiry -- let's call it up, it's INQ000056476, that's it, and it's page 37, please. If we could highlight the fourth paragraph, "In the very early stages ..." That's it, thank you.

"In the very early stages of the pandemic, modelling activities [as you have said] were dominated by Imperial College and ... LSHTM."

Then you say this:

"They had representatives on SAGE [so in the case of Imperial College that's Professor Ferguson, in the case of the London School that's Professor Edmunds] and therefore bypassed SPI-M-O."

Before I ask you about that, let me remind you of something that Professor Woolhouse said in his statement. I'm not going to call it up, but he refers to very much the same situation and talks about SAGE marking -- or rather SPI-M-O marking its own homework because there were essentially the same people on both committees.

Is that a problem that you're identifying by using the word "bypassing SPI-M-O" there?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: No, I think I'm referring to different things here. So I think in the very early days of SAGE it was very easy -- and I'm not sort of laying the blame here, I'm not saying this is anyone's fault -- but it was very easy, if there was a modelling question, for either John Edmunds or Neil Ferguson to say "Oh, we can answer that", and if that comes up in SAGE that seems a perfectly natural thing to do; and I think it was only later, when there were more groups involved with SPI-M-O, that the questions came to SPI-M-O and we addressed it as a larger group. So I think that was just a case of how it was.

In terms of marking our own homework, I'm not sure that's true either. I mean, yes, there were members of SPI-M-O who were on SAGE, but actually the times I went to SAGE and presented work I got a grilling by people who were, you know, experts in their own field and would really take you to task on the assumptions. So I don't think we ever did that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The point made by Professor Woolhouse, and he'll explain it for himself when he comes here, but he starts from the proposition that SAGE is supposed to be -- one of its functions is to challenge the conclusions drawn or the evidence provided by SPI-M-O, and makes the point that if the same people or the same people from the same area of expertise are on both committees, then the challenge function that might be provided by SAGE is bound to be diminished.

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Slightly. I think we'd already gone through rounds of modelling critique of the technical elements within SPI-M, or SPI-M-O, and I think, you know, that happened on the Tuesday meetings as well as the Wednesday meetings, and I think those were technical discussions that you wouldn't have wanted to have at SAGE. Whereas SAGE offered a more wide-ranging challenge to some of the premises and assumptions that we'd put in.

So I think -- I felt we'd got an awful lot of challenge. I don't think it's reflected terribly well in the minutes. You know, we've already had discussions of what the consensus statement is, but without wanting to list every single argument that was proposed and then defended, I don't know how you'd do that in a systematic way.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. We can take that off the screen.

I'm going to move on, Professor, and I want to address with you, and I hope develop, an area that we discussed with Professor Medley, which is the question of the range of experience and expertise on SPI-M-O.

You'll recall -- I think you were watching at least some of Professor Medley's evidence -- the passage in, again, Professor Woolhouse's statement where he made the point that SPI-M-O by its membership was eminently well qualified to address these epidemiological modelling issues, but couldn't really provide an answer to issues around deprivation, inequality, the economic impact of the pandemic.

Let's look, if we may, at part of your witness statement, which is paragraph 42, which starts on page 11, I believe. Yes. So it's the last two lines of this page and then going over to the next. You make a very similar point, Professor. You refer to the discussion about interaction between epidemiological and economic modelling. You say it was made clear to you that the role of SPI-M-O and SAGE did not extend to considering the economic consequences of infection or control measures -- so entirely as Professor Medley said -- and you endorse that position precisely because of the limits of your own and your colleagues' expertise.

You say that you would of course have been happy to collaborate with experts in these areas, and I think in another part of your statement you say you actually did more than that, you volunteered or you tried to --

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- make that happen?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: We certainly reached out at various times -- I mean, not as part of SPI-M-O, but as independent academics -- to try and work with groups who were looking at the economics.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And did that bear fruit? I'm going to come on and talk about your paper in a moment, but in terms of reaching out within the SAGE or SPI-M-O structure, did that work?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Well, not within SAGE and SPI-M-O, this was sort of from our academic group out to other academic groups.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So perhaps we are now talking about the paper and the work you did?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You refer to that, I think -- yes, so it's in fact the paragraph 43, which is on the page. You say that in late 2020 you worked with a large group of academics to explore the wider costs and benefits of social distancing measures over two time periods, one which I think was in the past at the time you did your work and one which was just in the future.

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And you say in the paper you used a willingness to pay approach, considering the economic losses the country would be willing to sacrifice to preserve one year of healthy life, and then you go on to describe the paper; is that right?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yes, that is correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's actually have a look at the paper itself, if we may, so it's INQ000205272. This is the paper that we see -- as you say, there are a series of authors, you're the third that we see on there, Professor.

If we can go to the second page, first of all, please, briefly, and let me say I'm not going to -- I'm sure it's fascinating, but not only given the time, I'm not going to get into the detail of the precise modelling that you did relating to those two time periods. I just want to look at the approach that you took.

So at the bottom of this page we see that the paper states at the last paragraph that:

"Much of the existing modelling literature on the pandemic has focused explicitly on the impacts of interventions that minimise the direct health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, such as the number of individuals being admitted to hospital and/or dying ..." and so on.

If we can go to the next page, please, at the top you refer to the fact that there are of course non-health benefits and harms that can arise as a result of the lockdown, and you list some sort of economic impacts, giving some examples in the hospitality sector and so on.

Then at the end of that paragraph you say:

"As a result, judicious use of lockdown measures may ultimately hasten economic recovery. It is therefore important to consider the effect of any control policy on the overall economic cost of an outbreak, taking into account both positive and negative health and economic effects."

Then a few lines further down where we see there is a 15, so about six or seven lines down in that passage, just one sentence, you say:

"In this paper ..."

And here I think you capture what you're trying to achieve:

"In this paper, we analyse the effectiveness of different control scenarios ... taking into account the positive impact on public health and the negative impact on the economy."

So does that summarise what you were trying to achieve?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We see further on down the page these terms that you referred to in your witness statement that you had used, you see:

"To establish the COVID-related health impacts, we calculate the quality adjusted life year (QALY) loss for each scenario."

You also then refer to the societal willingness to pay conversion factor.

Can you explain, I hope in lay terms, what you mean by those terms?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: I will try my best.

So QALY, or quality adjusted life year, is the idea of just counting how much health benefit you get from any particular intervention, so this could be giving someone a new type of drug, it could be vaccination, and what you look at is how many years of good healthy life have you saved, and what needs to be done in all of health economics is to balance that against the cost of the drugs, the cost of the vaccine, the cost of any intervention. We do that by having a willingness to pay. In the UK we usually set that at £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY, so per healthy life year, and that's the sort of standard metric that we have.

So that seems to sort of balance out all these costs and benefits, and so we wanted to try and apply the same logic to NPIs, so what was the economic consequence of doing certain interventions compared to the benefits that we got in terms of health, and we do that by balancing at this willingness to pay, which is usually £20,000, but we went across an entire range because it wasn't clear to us whether you're willing to pay more because it's a pandemic and you want to minimise the loss of life, or whether you're willing to pay less because it's a larger scale thing and we know that there's going to be some loss of life associated with it. So we looked across an entire range.

**Counsel Inquiry**: It's important to emphasise, isn't it, Professor, that this was not -- it sounds a rather cold hearted calculation to do, but it is something that is done routinely, as you say, both in the context of vaccines and also whether to purchase new drugs, for example?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yeah, it's the routine way. So JCVI, which I also sit on, has to go through this sort of process every time we put a new vaccine through the pipeline.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We heard from Professor Medley earlier a plea, almost, the point he was making that in order to -- for modellers to assist policymakers, they need to understand, policymakers need to explain what their objectives are. And is what you've just explained as the sort of choice of the willingness to pay figure, would that be something that you, as a modeller, would look to the politician or the policymaker to tell you about in order to inform your modelling?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: It's certainly a possible way of doing it. I mean, there's multiple ways of doing this balancing. One of the other things that's worth pointing out is that we look at a level of NPIs, but there's lots of ways of buying the same level of control. So, you know, deciding which elements of society you limit becomes the political decision, so it's not -- you know, it's not for SPI-M-O to say whether or not you shut schools or pubs; that then becomes a politician's type of decision.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, that leads me to another point I was going to raise with you, because we can see what you've been doing in this paper is taking a step beyond the sort of normal, if you like, epidemiological modelling and added a new dimension for economic impact. But of course, as we have heard in evidence in the last week or so, the pandemic had impacts that went well beyond economic impacts: we have schools closing, children not going to school, we have impact on various parts of society, we have impact on women and girls, domestic abuse; the list is very long.

In principle, would it be possible to extend this type of modelling to address those sorts of issues as well?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: In principle. This was very much set up as almost a pilot or a, you know, proof of principle to show what could be done. I think it's hard to put every single category in because you need to put a monetary value on them. It's probably also worth saying that, you know, I'm not an economist, and so our view of what the costs were of lockdowns are probably quite trivial compared to, you know, what an economics person would see and say "Ah, well, you know, there's long running implications for various businesses". But we just did GDP as the easiest single measure that we could take at the time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Perhaps in that regard if we can have a look back at your statement, please, page 14, paragraph 51. You've just indicated that perhaps the economic input into that paper was a little bit rudimentary, but you make the point here, picking it up three lines down:

"Developing the methodology to understand and quantify the broader impacts of pandemics, including mental health and societal wellbeing, requires a wide spectrum of academic disciplines."

So even wider than that group who wrote that paper with you. You describe it at that stage new, groundbreaking interdisciplinary work that takes time and is best undertaken before a pandemic.

Is it -- well, first of all, are you aware that these types of models, this type of work, taking forward that work that you did, is actually happening or not?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: I don't know of anyone who's undertaking it at the moment. I know several people who are applying for funding. There's various new funding initiatives that are around, so there's people applying for it. Whether it gets funded or not is a matter that we'll see in the future, but it's certainly an area that a lot of people are thinking about.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Again you've echoed a point that Professor Medley raised but, it seems self-evident that if this work is to be done it would be much more sensible to do it before the next pandemic rather than trying to do it in a rush before the next pandemic?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Definitely. I mean, we've learnt a lot during the pandemic but it's much more important to keep that going and to build on it.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

I want to move on, please. Could we look, staying with your statement, please, at page 6, paragraph 23. Picking it up three lines down, this is about the "following the science", you say:

"In my opinion, the use of the term 'following the science' led to the impression that the balance of evidence was weighted towards the scientific advice that was being provided. In turn, this led to negative attention being received by members of the scientific community."

Elsewhere you say that the term was confusing and unhelpful. Can you expand on those various thoughts, please?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yeah. I mean, I think what the paper showed on the balancing economics and health is that you can't just look at a single measure, and we know that politicians aren't going to do that. You can't just say "We want to save lives, reduce hospitalisations, no matter what", and we wouldn't expect them to. There needs to be a balance between health, economics, wellbeing, social care. And so I think just saying "following the science" made it sound like the science was being weighted more than anything else.

It was also the case that the science, certainly in terms of SAGE minutes and documents that went to SAGE, was being put into the public domain, whereas I don't -- I never saw any of the other evidence that we assume was being considered. I mean, we never saw it so we don't know. We never saw any of that.

So it very much felt as if, certainly in the early stages, any documents that went to SAGE were what was driving policy and therefore if individuals didn't like policy it reflected on the modellers, it reflected on the scientific advice that was going forward.

So I think quite often "following the science" sounded like we almost had too much power, and I don't think that was ever the case, and certainly not in the first year.

It was very much that we were answering questions that we thought might want to be asked, but -- you know, I think Professor Medley said this -- it wasn't until early 2021, when we started doing the roadmap documents, that there was a really good dialogue between scientists and policymakers, and I think by then we started to understand what --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Slow down. Sorry, I'm going to pause you a moment.

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Sorry.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You were saying it wasn't until early 2021 ...?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: That there was sufficient dialogue and understanding between policymakers and the scientists that we could actually do things like the roadmap to relaxation, which really was -- I think it was really the first time when there was this sort of marriage between science and policy that we knew what they wanted to do and we could generate policy-ready answers on a timescale that was important.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

I think you expand on that theme a little, if we can look at page 15 of your statement, paragraph 56. You say:

"During the early epidemic period there was some degree of misunderstanding between modellers and politicians; politicians were often asking questions that were way beyond the scope of any model, while for modellers it was often difficult to clearly communicate many of the subtleties and uncertainties to policymakers."

It sounds as though what you're describing is just missing each other?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yeah. I mean, we quite often got -- I can remember we had a question that came through of: what would be the impact of opening garden centres? Now, this sort of -- you know, our models are very much a caricature of what's going on in the real world. There are people who try and what's called -- form what's called a digital twin, which is, you know, you have individuals moving round within your computer model that try and replicate what's happening in the real world. Those are incredibly difficult to match to any data, so we're taking a much more sort of aggregate approach, averaging over people of a given age group, and so we can't address those sort of subtleties.

But in the same way I think when we communicate to policymakers we often do one figure and a page of caveats, and the caveats are as important as the figure, but it's very easy for someone to just look at a graph and read off the top curve.

So I think there was miscommunication in both directions.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, and you describe what Professor Medley described as the deeper engagement, if you like, between SPI-M-O and people from the Cabinet Office, which led to that more productive relationship --

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Definitely.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- later in the pandemic.

I think one last topic, Professor, and that's data. Can we have a look at paragraph 46, page 13, please. You start paragraph 46 by making the important observation that:

"Models are only as good as the data that feeds into them ..."

It's right, I think, that at various stages during the pandemic you struggled to get good enough data to put into your models?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yeah, I'd say that was true.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And you give us various examples in this witness statement. So in the balance of this paragraph, you describe a problem related to being -- related to being provided with the detail about the first time people tested but not subsequent tests; is that right?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yeah. So in -- up until, I think it was almost towards the end of 2021, we were only getting information on the first time someone tested positive, and if they tested subsequently that wasn't information that got fed through to SPI-M-O and, you know, in the first few months there was good reason for that, because if people tested twice within a week that's really the same infection. But as we started to get later, we needed to know about reinfections. As it was, reinfections weren't really that much important until we hit Omicron and when they became much more common, but we didn't know that without the, data and I think there's lots of cases of this where -- you know, modellers always want more data, but there were certain questions that we were handicapped from answering because of the format that the data came in.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

Looking down, in paragraph 47 you describe a disconnect between case and death data and hospital admission data. That may be an issue which -- I'm going to show you an email in a minute which I think probably touches on that.

But also in paragraph 48 you seem to be referring to a slightly different problem where, towards the end of that paragraph, you refer to differences in the ways data is reported and recorded by the four nations causing difficulties. What were those difficulties?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: So each of the devolved nations has its own way of recording data. So certainly for the first few months we were getting different datasets through from Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and England. Some of this is just how the data's formatted; some of it is actually the definitions that underpin it. So I believe at certain times Wales counted people in hospital with Covid in different ways to what England did, and this changed during the pandemic.

So what we needed to be careful of is: we're trying to model the underlying mechanisms and not model the counting process. So if people start counting things in different ways, it can make our job more complicated. But, as it says there, later -- DSTL and then UKHSA actually stepped in and did the routine data collection and cleaning, so we were starting to get it in a unified format, which made life so much easier.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do you think that that improvement, that sort of lesson, as it were, has now been learnt or do you think that perhaps, were you to go back to needing to access, let's say, hospital data or four nations data on a routine basis, these problems might crop up again?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: I think the problems would crop up again simply because -- I mean, for example we don't have an integrated electronic healthcare system, so each hospital trust collects its own data, and so somewhere that has to be aggregated.

Now, if we have another pandemic, I expect for the first few weeks that will just come through as the raw data, and then as time moves on we will get, you know, whichever group it is, probably UKHSA, actually formatting that into a single unified data structure.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'd like just -- the last document, I think. We looked at that questionnaire which you filled in, it's actually over a year ago now, but perhaps we could have another look at that, please. So that's INQ000056476, and it's page 39. Thank you.

So in fact a lot of the text that is included here you've adapted and used in your statement, so we can see next to the number 2 that statement about models only being as good as the data that feeds into them, and then the paragraph or so that follows, you're describing those problems with hospital data that we were just discussing.

Then I want to pick it up about ten lines from that number 36, where it says:

"I had hoped that many of these difficulties would have been resolved for the [what I gather we call Mpox these days] Monkeypox outbreak, but if anything, the data access issues are worse."

You say "are" because I take it that you were dealing with the Mpox outbreak in this time last year when you drafted this questionnaire; is that right?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: That's correct, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You go on to say:

"Admittedly SAGE and SPI-M are not directly involved in [Mpox] modelling, but the academic community has still been asked for its help. With [Mpox] the UK data is only available to UKHSA affiliated staff with a UKHSA laptop and is again siloed so that the entirety of the datasets are not available to all users."

Professor, we had a couple of days ago a data expert giving evidence to the Inquiry who expressed his own concerns that some of the advances in data sort of interoperability, if you like, that had been achieved during the pandemic might be slipping away -- and we showed him this passage in fact -- but it sound as though there is reason to be concerned that things might be just as bad in the next pandemic as they were in the last one?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: I think there's reasons to be concerned. Talking to people within UKHSA, it's clear that they understand this is a problem and they are working towards solutions, but I don't think any of these solutions are trivial. There's a large amount of ethics, GDPR, lots and lots of regulations that surround being able to just freely give out data. There are partial solutions, as it says sort of towards the end. OpenSAFELY is a fantastic example of a repository where people can access health data in a very, very secure environment, but I don't think that's yet caught up to the computational demands that we have for modelling, which are vast. I mean, I was generally sort of maxing out our computer clusters at Warwick over a weekend to generate the next week's projections. So that type of power isn't available very often within these systems.

So I think there's a conflict between how we make these things secure enough that data doesn't go outside the system but still allow us to utilise the power of university computer systems.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Professor, we've talked a number of times, both with you and Professor Medley, today about, as it were, the roof needs to be fixed while the sun was shining -- I think someone else used that analogy -- but preparations for the next pandemic that need to be made in between pandemics; and it seems to me this is -- what you're saying is something in that category?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: Yes, definitely. I mean, it's not a small task, though. I think this is -- you know, we need the protocols in place. It would need an awfully large amount of work to actually try and integrate this into a reasonable system, and I think we also have the problem of trying to second-guess what the next pandemic and the next data needs will look like. It's very hard to say, yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Presumably it's work that needs to be continually refreshed because, as computers change, as datasets change, as perhaps the law changes, then the way in which it's going to be stored and provided to modellers may change as well?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: That's correct, yeah.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But certainly something for this Inquiry to consider -- you may have a view on this -- as to whether it's work that would be appropriate so that, when the next pandemic takes place, you in your modelling teams have data ready to go to assist policymakers from the start?

**Professor Matthew Keeling**: I mean, I think it's vital, but I also think it is something that UKHSA is looking at at the moment. It's not that everyone is sitting back and just saying, "We'll do it the next time we have to", I think it is being undertaken but it is going to be a slow process.

**Mr O'Connor**: Yes. Thank you, Professor.

My Lady, those are all the questions I have time for.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Professor Keeling.

You are obviously one of those people who worked extraordinarily long hours to serve the public, and I fear that you and your colleagues haven't received the recognition that you deserve. So may I speak on behalf of all those who have been following the work that you and your colleagues did, and express my gratitude again. I've expressed it to other of your colleagues, but may I express it to you too.

**The Witness**: Thank you very much.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you. I'm afraid doing public service doesn't always get recognition.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: 10 o'clock tomorrow, please.

*(4.00 pm)*

*(The hearing adjourned until 10 am on Friday, 13 October 2023)*
