*MR STUART GLASSBOROW (affirmed).*

Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Mr Keating**: Do sit down, thank you.

Could you give the Inquiry your full name, please.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Stuart Richard Glassborow.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Mr Glassborow, thank you so much for attending today, thank you for assisting the Inquiry with its investigations.

A few things just by way of preamble. First of all, both of us need to keep our voices up. Secondly, pace, if we could monitor our pace because there is a record being kept of what you and I say, and from time to time I may ask you to pause just to control the flow of information, if that's okay. And lastly, if any of my questions are unclear, do please ask me to rephrase them, because I'm sure the fault would be with me.

Your statement, you provided a statement to the Inquiry dated 11 October of this year. It runs to 35 pages, with 50 exhibits. We can see it in front of us, and you have signed it at the back, confirming that it's true to the best of your knowledge and belief; is that correct?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You have had the chance to refresh your memory in relation to the statement and other documents as well before coming in today?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Your evidence covers the time that you were the deputy principal private secretary to the Prime Minister in number two's private office, isn't that correct?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: That's correct, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Bit of a mouthful, but you were number two to Martin Reynolds?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: To Martin, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. And today we want to explore with you really to understand the system in which economic information and analysis and advice was provided and fed through you or other means to the Prime Minister and core decision-makers, its evolution during that period, and whether there was any issues with its provision and incorporation, and lastly, and importantly, whether there was any lessons that we, the Inquiry, can learn in relation to that.

So first area, an overview of your role. You have been a civil servant for over 20 years and still are, isn't that correct?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Initially working DWP and then, thereafter, in the Treasury, and for three years, 2019 to May 2022, you were on secondment to Number 10 as the deputy principal private secretary, as we just heard?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Then you returned back to the Treasury and you continue to be there to this day?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In relation to how a private office works and the role of a principal -- or a deputy principal private secretary, we have heard evidence about that, so I'm going to take it very briefly, but is it fair to say it's a key liaison role?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: It does play a liaison role. The private office -- you did hear about this last week -- is --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- that small team, you know, providing direct administrative support for the PM as he discharges his role. You know, arranging meetings --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- relaying commissions or read-outs or decisions from the Prime Minister, obviously to the much, you know, bigger unit that is the Cabinet Office and all the other departments in government as well. So it's a sort of small administrative team working around the Prime Minister.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The team is a conduit, and in relation to what you've mentioned in your statement, it facilitates joined-up decision-making, you say this, it facilitates:

"... coordinated, joined-up decision-making ... and to synthesise, track and drive progress on the Prime Minister's priorities across central government."

Is that a fair summary?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think yes, it is, obviously working closely with the political team and colleagues in the Cabinet Office as well, but yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: That phrase "synthesised", it's been used already this morning and it touches upon your statement, and we will return to it, about how information is funnelled through into Number 10 and how that is then presented, synthesised, to the Prime Minister.

As your role as deputy PPS to Sir Martin, you oversaw domestic policies, and Imran Shafi, who we have heard evidence from, he was one of the private secretaries who worked alongside -- underneath you, you were his manager, isn't that correct?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Multiple meetings. The pandemic consumed your working life ore the period of time you were in Number 10, I think that's fair to say and to recognise, and you were involved in multiple meetings and multiple types of meetings.

What I wish to draw out are the meetings on an economic front that you were involved in, key meetings. From your statement, we can draw out this: that there was 11 different types of meetings but the core ones, is it not, were the PM's morning meetings, the 9.15s, and you were involved with HMT, Her Majesty's Treasury, and economy meetings such as the bilateral meetings with the Chancellor, and in relation to those you mentioned that they were on a weekly/fortnightly cycle; is that correct?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yeah -- the PM's bilateral meeting --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- with the Chancellor? Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you. So bilateral means Chancellor and Prime Minister?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: And the supporting teams --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Of course.

Data dashboard meetings, which we have heard about generally, the economy dashboard meetings, which we're going to touch upon in a few moments, and in addition there was regular meetings between you and senior HMT officials, you were the link person between HMT and Number 10.

Before turning to that economic funnelling of information and the synthesising of information, I want to touch upon the initial response of the UK Government. We've heard a lot of evidence about that already, so it's going to be quite short, but you were a person who was there in person actually during this time, and you've touched upon it in your statement. In relation to the initial response of Number 10 in January up until late February, your evidence distills to this, does it not: everyone was broadly carrying on business as usual, we were unaware of the likely scale and impact of the pandemic and therefore treated it as one of the many issues crossing the PM's desk up until late February 2020.

Is that a fair representation of the evidence in your statement?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You add this, and perhaps we could bring this up, it's page 17, paragraph 62(a), please. Last three lines:

"To the best of my knowledge, we in Private Office -- and the No 10 machine more generally -- were not advised of the likely scale of the pandemic and its impacts."

This is at late February.

Just reflecting upon that, and there is a caveat there, "to the best of [your] knowledge", but is that an accurate statement, that the Number 10 machine was not advised of the likely scale of the pandemic and its impacts?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think the point that I'm looking to make here is that in this initial period -- you mentioned sort of January and February -- as you said, Covid was one of the issues the Prime Minister was engaging with --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- alongside lots of others, you know, including the sort of development of the budget that the Chancellor was to deliver and -- I think on 11 March, and High Speed 2 and 5G and I think some of the things that other witnesses mentioned last week, and at that time -- in this time, while I think there is -- you know, there's all the information and analysis that's being discussed in the COBR forums and coming in from SAGE at this time and -- what I don't recall hearing was sort of lots of representations that the sort of Prime Minister's diary should be completely cleared of everything else and that he should be solely focused on Covid in this phase, as opposed to it being, as you said, one of those issues amongst many.

Now, that might sound a bit odd in hindsight now, but I think that was the felt experience at the time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just pausing there, in relation to focus, the focus was elsewhere; is that a fair summary?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, I think there was significant focus on Covid, it was an issue and there was data coming in and the Prime Minister was briefed on it in a way I think you've heard about from -- last week from other witnesses, but there were lots of other issues as well. I mean, you know, genuinely substantive issues on their own terms.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Was it a case from an economic point of view, and that was your liaison with the Prime Minister, was that he at that stage, up until mid-February, was more concerned about the economic effect of an overreaction to Covid?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Erm ... I don't know if I would characterise it, his view, like that. Or -- I mean, I don't have a completely clear view of what might have been in his mind then, but I think the idea that one would not want to overreact was something that was -- I mean, I think if he -- I do recall that phrase, and I think he's reflecting some of the advice he received. For example, I think the CCS advice on 28 February, which I think, again, you've looked at a bit --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- refers to sort of the need to balance the need -- the desire to take precautionary measures that -- while not overreacting. So in that -- I mean, I think he -- I recall him in a sense echoing the advice he received.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Was it little bit more than that, bearing in mind that before events unfolded in Lombardy we -- he was referring to, "Well, is this like swine flu? It's not that serious. There is a danger of overreacting"?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I mean, I don't recall him saying that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No? Not in your daily interactions with him, that's not something which came up?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: No.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You describe in your evidence that the second phase in the response at Number 10 is when the scale of the problem in northern Italy became clear and intensity of work stepped up in late February; is that correct?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And then we fast forward to a change in strategy on 13 March, where you were present at a significant meeting with Mr Cummings, Mr Warner, Mr Shafi and Ms MacNamara, on the evening of 13 March, and you recall that, don't you?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: This followed on, as you say, from the SAGE meeting that day. How would you describe the mood in the room amongst this collection of civil servants and advisers?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, I think it was a very serious discussion, because as -- this was sort of a moment where I think Ben Warner was reporting back from the SAGE discussion, and the -- and the -- you know, the latest data from that and what that might mean. And in parallel Helen MacNamara, as you heard from last week, I think, sort of relayed, you know, her new latest understanding of the sort of readiness of, you know, the government wider plans for dealing with the pandemic, and you got both of those things being part of that same discussion, which made it a pretty serious discussion.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Helen MacNamara funnelling in her knowledge, enquiries into Civil Contingencies Secretariat, Department of Health plans --

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: From the Cabinet Office, yes, exactly.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Ben Warner feeding in his review and assessment of the SAGE meeting and the modelling?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yeah, so you've got both those issues --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- sort of coming -- as it happens, coming together in one discussion that evening.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And was this a case of civil servants and political advisers really taking over a view of what the strategic direction should have been?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, the nature of that discussion was to talk through the two issues that we've just mentioned, in particular the sort of latest data from SAGE and what that might imply for I think what's now been described as plan A --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- for managing the virus, with, you know, I think an awareness amongst the group of people that there may be a case for pivoting to a different plan in order to protect the NHS, something, you know, more -- closer to suppression rather than mitigation, to achieve that, and also that the challenge may be more immediate than had perhaps been appreciated by some people.

But while this is -- you know, it felt like at the time and talking to you now it feels like a very significant discussion, it is also just some of the Prime Minister's team and someone from the Cabinet Office in effect preparing a meeting or meetings for that weekend, and that was what happened, is the output from those discussions was for us -- for us to -- well, convene meetings to prepare to brief the Prime Minister and for him to engage or hear from the scientists directly, meet some of his ministerial colleagues, and those were the meetings that took place on the Saturday and Sunday. So the scale of the issues are significant, but the -- in a sense, it doesn't feel like an unusual process to me.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I don't want to cut you short, but they're long answers, and we'll perhaps try to condense them a little bit more to assist our stenographer.

You used the phrase "pivoting" in relation to the plan, perhaps an understatement. The strategy was jettisoned, was it not, when you went for the meeting with Prime Minister on 14 March, which you touch upon in your statement, but the view was that there was a real need for an immediate lockdown, isn't that correct?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Erm, I'm not sure -- I'm not sure -- my recollection is not that there was the realisation or the view that we need an immediate lockdown. As I say, I think the two key points on the data or what might be implied by the data in those discussions on the Saturday, or the Prime Minister's meetings, related to the need to take more significant measures --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- than had been hitherto imagined, and possibly to -- well, and to move quicker than had been envisaged. And I think --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Pause there. There's a follow-up question that will hopefully assist you. Two questions which flow from this and then I'm going to move on to our main topic.

Was there an agreement or acknowledgement at that meeting on 14 March that there would be a need for a lockdown?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, I think the read-out from that meeting says that it was agreed that it was the right time to implement measures sooner than had been envisaged. And then the summary, the read-out from the follow-up meeting, on the 15th, was that measures should be brought to COBR, the actual official decision-making forum, that meeting happened on the Monday, to take -- you know, to implement advisory measures on working from home, staying at home, not going to pubs and restaurants, ie the sorts of things that the Prime Minister then announced on the 16th.

So sort of looking back at the records, from my recollection, the discussions that weekend played into the measures that the Prime Minister announced on the 16th. Which at the time felt very significant interventions. It's not --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I can't think of any other time in recent history a Prime Minister has announced those sorts of measures.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So pausing there --

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: What I -- okay.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Was there -- from what your -- the short answer is, well, no, there wasn't a discussion about having a lockdown, there was a discussion regarding an agreement regarding more restrictions, more NPIs; was that the position?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, I think significant ramping up of the NPIs. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that from after the event we have quite a strong concept of lockdown, what exactly that entails, the different elements of that is sort of embodied in 23 March. I don't -- from my recollection, I don't recall, certainly not, you know, widespread understanding of that being the thing that ought to happen or we ought to get there by a certain date. I more recall discussions happening in real time that led to the sort of announcements on 16 March, the closing of schools further -- later that week, the further restrictions I think that were announced on the Friday --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Pausing there.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- which all then ...

**Lady Hallett**: Let him finish, I think it might be quicker in the long run, Mr Keating.

**Mr Keating**: Forgive me.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: But then the realisation the following weekend or the advice the following weekend that there was a need to go further and hence the -- what we now know as a lockdown being implemented on the 23rd.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So it was a case more of rolling measures of NPIs which then evolved into a lockdown?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes, in the light of the --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- data being updated and our, you know, increasing awareness of the situation.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The last question on this: was it the case from 14 March that the Prime Minister expressed that there was a need to play for time before imposing greater restrictions such as a lockdown?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: No, I don't recall that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No recollection?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: No.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm going to move on to the economic aspects, which is a central aspect of your evidence today.

You mentioned, and we touched upon it already, that HMT, Her Majesty's Treasury, was a core part of your role, and, again obvious, HMT having a central role in government really because of the financial aspect; is that fair?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You mention at paragraph 31 of your statement that one aspect of your role is to crystallise the options for the Chancellor and the PM in the round, having regard to the choices, priorities and the trade-offs inherent in economic and fiscal policy, and you were the lead between, as we've discussed already, the Chancellor and the Prime Minister in that respect.

Drawing your evidence together on this is that in that sort of crystallisation of the options role, is it right that you would commission and communicate data analysis and advice, prepare meetings, and commission advice as necessary?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yeah. I mean, I think it's the Treasury's job to crystallise the options and, as you say, in the round, ie looking at the interlinkages or the trade-offs between them. My role, slightly more mundanely, was to sort of help prepare the meetings for the Chancellor and the Prime Minister to discuss those. I mean, you know, for example, as would then be decided or announced by the Chancellor at budgets or spending reviews --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- in normal times.

**Counsel Inquiry**: But in any event, you were a key conduit between Number 10 and HMT?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of what information, what economic information the Prime Minister was receiving via HMT and from other sources, coming in at times through you, you touch upon this at paragraph 36 -- perhaps we could bring that up.

"... I sought to ensure that the Prime Minister ... [had] ... the latest economic and financial information received from HMT ... [appraisal] of relevant economic analysis pertaining to specific options for managing the pandemic; and ... [he was] able to engage the Chancellor on decision-making on economic and fiscal policy ..."

So that he was informed to respond to the Chancellor.

How was that done? How did you ensure that he had that information?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, I'll perhaps work through the three elements briefly to give a sense of this.

So I think the first part of the Chancellor's role in providing economic advice to the Prime Minister, obviously supported by the Treasury, is at point (a) here, giving a description of the latest economic situation, financial information.

During the pandemic, we instigated, I instigated a regular series of economy dashboard meetings which for the chief economic adviser, you heard from earlier, to -- and colleagues in the Cabinet Office and on occasion from other departments to present to the Prime Minister, that sort of picture, building on -- I mean, that -- we instigated that because of the sheer scale and pace of the issues that were evolving at the time, but it builds on regular weekly briefings, market updates that are coming through by email that I would then, you know, put in the PM's box as relevant --So there's an established way of doing that that we built on.

On the second --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Sorry, would you like -- because it's one of the topics I was going to explore, why don't we deal with it sequentially, because there's a section on economic dashboards --

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Okay.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- yes. While we're talking about it, let's deal with it, because you mention at paragraph 40 of your statement that you sought to systemise the economic briefing for the Prime Minister and you established a series of economic dashboard meetings which ran from June 2020, and these took place roughly every three or four weeks in sequence, and that was in parallel to the reporting of information that was available.

Why did you feel the need to systemise the economic briefing in June 2020?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, as I say, I think, you know, there's an established practice for the chance -- you know, there's various means by which the Chancellor and the Treasury on his behalf provide this sort of analysis to the Prime Minister in normal times, like directly in meetings or bilateral meetings that they might have together, or through sort of written briefing, but the thought here is just the scale of the, you know, issues and impacts from the virus or the measures taken to manage the virus meant and the speed at which they were sometimes moving made Treasury colleagues and I think that it was worth having -- I think you said three to four weeks, I think there were initially weekly meetings actually. For much of that for 2020, I think there were pretty much weekly meetings, to take the Prime Minister through the latest on employment, inflation, how different sectors are doing, different regions are doing, consumer behaviour, business behaviour. This all sounds quite dry, but it is the info -- the data that relates to people's lives --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- and livelihoods.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, let's -- we can look at the notes and illustrations so people know what you're talking about. You said there were weekly -- I was quoting you -- three to four --

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Okay.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- times a week, but I'm quite happy for that clarification.

In terms of attendees, and we'll look at one in a moment, those who were present at these meetings, is it right it was the chief economic adviser from HMT, other senior officials, and on occasion would the CMO or the CSA be at any of these meetings?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: So for the most part the Cabinet Office sort of brought these together, so a senior official in the Cabinet Office with the chief economic adviser. On occasion I think maybe some officials from other departments. If some of the data related to sort of businesses, you might have someone from the Business Department would be present as well, and then I think CMO or CSA did attend a couple -- you know, some of these meetings as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's look at one. So it's a dashboard which was prepared to show at the meeting.

INQ000281288, please.

And this is one of your exhibits, and it's dashboard 14. So we're looking at this as an illustration of one type of way economic information was fed through to the Prime Minister.

If we could turn to page 2, please, this is just a snapshot of what would be referred to -- retail sales, consumer and business confidence, and the labour market.

Let's look at page 3 just for a moment. The graphs perhaps speak for itself.

Page 4, at this stage we're 29 October, we have "Eat Out andMobility". We see there on the graph, the blue line, that there was -- for the UK average, that there was a significant increase in eating out at that stage as a result of that scheme; is that correct?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think that's what it shows, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Perhaps we could deal with, whilst we're dealing with information, pause and deal with Eat Out to Help Out, and your knowledge of it from the Number 10 perspective. We have heard some evidence already this morning from Ms Lombardelli from the HMT perspective.

Eat Out to Help Out, would you agree, a significant economic measure that summer?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: It was a -- I think it was a reasonably significant economic measure. It was part of the summer economic plan the Chancellor announced on 8 July, I think, and one measure amongst several, including, I think, a sort of £9 billion job retention scheme and a £14 billion business rates support, £9 billion on grants, sort of £3 billion, you know, cut in stamp duty, and this measure was one part of that package. I think actually the cost of it was only a few hundred million, so from the sort of purely fiscal scale it was -- you know, I think it was only a few percentage points, as it were, of the overall economic package that the Chancellor did announce at that time, but obviously it was a significant measure.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, significant measure, significant in terms of trying to change human behaviour and to get consumers out into society; is that a fair summary?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think it is. I mean, I recall a bit from the time, but also -- but have sort of looked at some of the documents since in preparing for this, that I think the Treasury and the Chancellor, you know, sought to design the scheme to operate within the wider Covid framework in place at the time, or the guidelines that had been developed and announced, and, you know, I think 23 June the Cabinet decided to open, you know, hospitality --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- as part of a wider approach of incorporating a sort of Covid-secure, you know, regime -- a Covid-secure sort of way of living, with, you know, use of table service, restrictions on group size, maintaining safe distance in the space. And I think that was, you know, the wider regime for managing the virus and then this economic policy was designed -- I mean, as I understand it reading the Treasury material now --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- was designed to sort of fit in within that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So what I'd like you to do is, putting aside the Treasury perspective at the moment, is from your perspective, Number 10, about your knowledge of this scheme and how it evolved.

It probably flows from your answer already, this was something which was, am I right in understanding, was driven by HMT and the Chancellor as a scheme; is that correct?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of its formulation, when did you at Number 10, as that sort of conduit with the Treasury, when did you become aware of this scheme was about to launch?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think it was in a meeting on 2 July when the Chancellor took the Prime Minister through in fact the overall summer economic plan that we've mentioned. I mean, there -- at some point in late May the Chancellor had done a very, very high level view of sort of his early thinking, where, you know, he'd mentioned, you know, the idea of sort of targeted tax cuts or a subsidy scheme, sort of that level of detail, but something that looks like Eat Out to Help Out was something I heard about on 2 July.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. And was there no awareness -- or did there become an awareness at Number 10 that there was no scientific analysis of the impact this scheme would have on the virus?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I don't recall whether that was discussed in that meeting.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And thereafter we had this period from July until the launch of the scheme in August; was there any knowledge in that intervening period of the absence of scientific evidence?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think I and others in Number 10, you know, did become aware that, as you say, there hadn't been direct CMO, CSA, SAGE analysis or advice on this policy, so we did come to know that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: When -- you say before the launch of the scheme in August?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And was it the case that a view was taken, "Well, we're going to persist with the scheme in any event"?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, I don't -- I mean, I can't speak on behalf of, you know, all people who would have had an interest in this. I don't recall, you know, significant sort of representations being made to sort of in some sense revisit the policy. That's not to say that some people didn't have views or -- you know, one way or another at that time, but in the sort of wider context was -- as I say, this was one measure in -- in a purely sort of fiscal sense, quite a small measure amongst the whole wider economic package. And, you know, some awareness that this was the sort of type of scheme that was being implemented in other countries as well.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No more on Eat Out to Help Out.

Let's return back to the dashboard and go to page 5, please.

We're going to look at two more pages on this slide and then put it to one side. Here, again, is the sort of information which the Prime Minister would see, and other key decision-makers. We see "Consumer and Business Confidence" and its negativity during that period. And lastly we see, if we could turn to page 7, which are -- and page 8, please. Thank you.

In terms of the parts of the economy, the sectors which were presented in this information, we can see it was broken down into sectors which could operate remotely, those which required a physical presence of workers and those which required a physical presence of consumers.

That's how the sectors were divided; is that correct?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And one question is this: in relation to the economic data which has been funnelled through and represented in these dashboards, or other dashboards around that time, did it consider the impact on different socioeconomic groups or different ethnic groups?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think -- I mean, I don't have in my mind the precise content of all of them. We had, I think, around 40 of these meetings sort of through 2020 and 2021, so I can't recall the precise content. I mean, we followed a broad template, but it evolved over time.

I think -- I mean, two thoughts. One, in these meetings is sort of facilitated precisely that discussion, for example there was quite a lot of discussion at different points about the hospitality sector, the very significant impact of the virus on that sector, and the fact that its workforce is disproportionately young and lower paid, from ethnic minority --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- and female, in fact, and that that sort of -- I recall that being the sort of issue that was being discussed off the back of this information.

I think the second thing I stressed -- I would stress as well is that the purpose of this tool was a sort of -- the provision of information, contextual data for the Prime Minister, building on -- I mean, some of -- a lot of this data was in the main Covid dashboard as well --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- used in those much more -- even more frequent meetings, but this sort of built that out a bit further for the Prime Minister.

The policy -- the advice on what measures to take to manage the virus, what, you know, restrictions to impose or, you know, how and when to lift certain measures as the virus is abating, that was brought together by the Cabinet Office with input from the Treasury on that policy, and my very strong recollection is that, you know, those key bits of advice from, you know, the Cabinet Office for the Prime Minister, for Covid-O, Covid-S meetings, the main committee meetings you have heard about previously, all included sort of equalities information, the impact of the virus and how that actually itself was having disproportionate impacts on, for example, certain ethnicity minorities --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Pausing there --

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- and -- I'll just finish the point --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: -- just on -- and the economic -- you know, the economic measures of closing or opening certain sectors or taking measures in certain regions might have particular impacts as well. So those policy documents did contain that sort of information.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We're aware of the wider information. I was just asking in relation to economic effect in relation to ethnic groups or socioeconomic groups, whether that was presented in a dashboard. Can you do -- can you assist the Inquiry, go back over those dashboards, check what the position is and whether this is a representative dashboard and then we'll know whether that data comes through, please.

Another source of information, economic information, between -- for the Prime Minister was the bilateral meetings with the Chancellor, and in relation to those, we've heard a little bit about them, they were meetings which took place in any event, they were a regular feature pre-and perhaps post-Covid.

But one question is this, in relation to the amount of meetings going on at that time, 09.15 meetings, Covid-S, the quad, the Cabinet: why was there a need for these bilateral meetings between the Chancellor and Prime Minister only at that time?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think the Prime Minister had bilateral meetings with a range of his colleagues. I mean, he does in normal times and he did in this time. I mean, that is a normal feature of government, for the Prime Minister to meet specific colleagues to discuss issues in their portfolio.

The main items being discussed in these specific meetings was on sort of economic interventions or economic support measures. So I mentioned earlier that, you know, the Prime Minister typically in committee meetings would decide what, how -- what measures to take to respond to the virus, what restrictions to impose, which restrictions to lift. Once sort of that path is set, as it were, at a point in time, there would then be a need for the government to consider what economic measures to take. So, for example, in March 2020 we've locked down, the Treasury bring forward a proposal on furlough to support workers at that time, and the sorts of measures I mentioned earlier in summer, economic plan, the tax measures, stamp duty, et cetera, and those tax and spend measures, as it were, conditioned on the wider context as set out -- you know, as determined by the virus, as determined by other decisions, those would be the ones that principally the Prime Minister and Chancellor would discuss in their bilateral meetings.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Could I ask one question in relation to that, which is this: you mentioned that these meetings were in terms largely if not solely for support in relation to decisions and strategy which had been agreed, economic support. Was it ever that these meetings were an area where the Chancellor or the Prime Minister would look to review or finalise a strategy such as lockdown?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think the Prime Minister and the Chancellor did discuss in some of these meetings the question of how to manage the virus, as I imagine the Prime Minister did with -- in his meetings with the Health Secretary and, you know, as relevant to Education Secretary as well.

They weren't the decision-making forums for those decisions. That would be the meetings in -- well, ultimately Cabinet, but the Covid-O, Covid-S committee meetings with the range of ministers in them.

What, where they are, in effect, the decision-making meeting is on these economic policy, furlough, scheme for the self-employed, loans, grants, and that is actually I think a pretty long established convention, that on -- you know, it may even be enshrined, I think, in the Cabinet Manual -- that on those sorts of economic policies which in normal times typically manifest themselves in budgets, but here we were having sort of announcements quite -- more frequently than that, those decisions were for the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to take together.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Four remaining topics which we're going to cover before lunchtime, and one of them is synthesiser, your role, and what does that mean?

So you mention in your statement that at paragraph 51 you saw your role as:

"... to ensure input from across government was synthesised in order to help the Prime Minister bring together the range of views -- sometimes opposing -- so that he could make decisions effectively and on an informed basis. This was a two-way process, in a sense that my role also involved communicating the Prime Minister's steers, and decisions, colleagues ..."

And that's something, in a report, we're going to touch upon in a moment, is that the synthesisation of information.

Are you content with what you set out there; is that an accurate representation of your role, synthesising information for the Prime Minister?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think it may not be 100% clear, just to come back to some of what we were discussing a moment ago. I mean, from my role, as me as an individual being the point person with the Treasury and the Chancellor's team, you know, there would be these sort of data flows that I mentioned earlier, weekly briefing, market data and the like, that, you know, I'd have sight of and put to the PM as relevant, you know, new -- you know, as it emerges.

On the bit -- I would just sort of underscore, linking back towards it, that the bringing together of the analysis and the policy on the management of the pandemic, that's what the Cabinet Office did, taking, you know, predominant -- primarily the health data, the scientific analysis, but also, alongside that, the economic data on sectors and region -- you know, different bits of the country, and the like. And that would -- they would bring that together in the papers for the sort of committee meetings. So I wasn't there writing lots of primary, you know, documentation for the Prime Minister. The sort of much larger team in the Cabinet Office was doing that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Your role, as we discussed already, was a conduit, not as a policymaker --

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Exactly.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- or policy adviser?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Exactly.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I want to turn to the Institute for Government report, which you've seen already. It's entitled "The Treasury during Covid. What lessons can be learned from the pandemic?" Dated April 2023. And again, this is the part function of the Inquiry, lessons learned, so I would like your assistance in relation to this. You've seen it already, as I mentioned.

Perhaps we could bring it up. It's INQ000226497, at page 1, please.

And the Inquiry has also heard evidence from Alex Thomas, who is from that organisation as well. So there we see the front page, and the authors, and it's a 108-page report, we're not going to turn to each and every page, but I'd like you to -- it's probably correct to recognise that the report talks and outlines the positive aspects of the Treasury response. It includes financial support, engagement with other departments. So it outlines some positive aspects to the Treasury response.

I wish to have your perspective on some of their other observations which maybe fall within that lessons learned category, and one of those is optimism bias, and perhaps we could turn to page 7 in relation to that. I'll bring up the text, I'll read it out to you and I'll ask for your perspective and experience.

Bottom of the page:

"During the summer and autumn of 2020, the Treasury appears to have suffered from an optimism bias that the government's public health advisers did not share ... This led the Treasury to: not implement some relatively easy improvements to support schemes; implement the Eat Out to Help Out policy in summer 2020, which was inconsistent with scientific advisers' assessment of the risk of a second wave; and announce very late the extension of furlough in autumn 2020."

The whole text is there, I've read out most but not all.

From your perspective, from being the conduit, is that a description which you could relate to, that there was a degree of optimism bias in summer and autumn 2020?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I mean, obviously my role is -- I was in Number 10 supporting the Prime Minister, I find it a bit difficult to comment on the -- what the -- is somehow the Treasury's mindset. I mean, I was managing some of the processes that we're -- we have been talking about earlier. What I do know is obviously the Treasury -- you know, the Treasury had the same scientific analysis and information as everyone else in government at this time, and also -- I mean, this obviously relates to a specific period of time. I think there were quite -- there were several discussions, sort of committee meetings, to think about sort of future strategy should the second wave come forward. You know, to continuously plan or prepare for that in the summer, which I know the Treasury team helped prepare and the Chancellor participated in, so I think that's my understanding.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Information sharing and data is our next point, let's go to page 6, please, and it should be our second bullet point. It set out what we've discussed already, that:

"... the main responsibility for synthesising evidence from across government to inform central decision making ..."

Is with Cabinet Office.

"But the Treasury, as a powerful player at the centre of government, had an important role to play too and had ability to advocate for and generate better information sharing."

Again, perhaps uncontroversial, but do you agree with that summary of the roles?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I agree with the -- I agree with the summary of the roles, I think it says the same thing that we were discussing earlier about the role of the Cabinet Office.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Within that context, if we could pan out to look at the third paragraph, please, it says this:

"There was a stark contrast in the transparency of economic evidence informing ministers' decisions compared with the scientific evidence. Very little of the social and economic evidence that informed ministers' decisions was published, particularly before 2021, and the Treasury shared almost none of its analysis externally, even with trusted experts. This lack of transparency hampered effective synthesis of evidence (and thus decision making) and may have undermined the government's ability to convince the public of the merits of public health restrictions."

Pausing there for a moment, do you agree with that analysis that there was a lack of transparency of information from the Treasury?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Again, the perspective I can speak from is sort of within Number 10, and the Prime Minister I think did receive a lot of information in the different ways that we've discussed, and I won't sort of go over them all, again, but, you know, on the wider economic situation, the economic analysis relating to sort of the measures taken to manage the virus and on options and ideas for economic support. And in the different ways and different forums that we've -- that we've mentioned.

As I read this, this is sort of perhaps an observation about transparency not with Number 10 but more widely in government or beyond that, and, I mean, I ... from the role I was doing, you know, that's not something I had so much of a clear view on.

**Counsel Inquiry**: There is one part which does touch upon you, because it suggests this, that this lack of transparency hampered the effective synthesis of evidence, which is the Cabinet Office/Number 10's role. Do you agree with that observation in this report?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I don't recall having that thought at the time, no.

**Counsel Inquiry**: If we go -- continue down, please.

**Lady Hallett**: I suppose it would depend on who had the information and what do you mean by being transparent. Do you mean telling the public, do you mean telling other people who need to know, I suppose?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, sorry, as ...?

**Lady Hallett**: The synthesis would only be effected if the people who needed the information didn't get it.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Sorry, I don't quite follow the point.

**Lady Hallett**: No, well, probably I'm not making --

**Mr Keating**: It's probably my fault for -- effectively it's this: those questions in the report, you were responsible, the Cabinet Office was responsible, for the synthesis of the evidence, and the IFG report says -- after drawing in observations and soundings from a number of different sources says that there was a lack of transparency at HMT, which impacted, they say, Number 10's ability to synthesise the evidence. So that's the suggestion. What do you say to that?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, I think the same point I had earlier. I didn't have that -- that feeling at the time, so in terms of the Treasury's input to the Cabinet Office, I -- you know, well, I guess that's my answer. I think maybe if your point was that before that could the Treasury have gone about its business in a different way in terms of what it was gathering or understanding and testing out with other ... I mean, I find it a bit ... I mean -- I --

**Lady Hallett**: No, sorry --

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I don't feel that I could sort of comment on how the Treasury goes about its business, as it were, before it then turns to the Cabinet Office or Number 10.

**Lady Hallett**: No, sorry, my point was, and perhaps it's unfair on you, it should go to the authors of the document, but it all depends -- if the authors of the document are criticising the transparency of the Treasury, it all depends on what they mean by transparent: do they mean telling Cabinet Office or do they mean telling the public?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yeah.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry, that was the --

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: I tell you what you can probably help on. In normal circumstances -- this was obviously a time of national emergency -- in normal circumstances would you expect the advice that the Treasury gives to the Prime Minister and to the Cabinet Office to synthesise for the Prime Minister to be made public at the time, or at all?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, I think in a sense that's what budget documents or spending review documents do. In normal times the government makes -- the Treasury, you know, sets out a whole bundle of decisions on tax and spending and other measures and sets out the relevant analysis, or indeed, actually -- well, sorry, sets out the relevant thinking and some of the analysis behind some of those policies, with a much fuller sort of exposition on the fiscal and economic impacts context in the associated documents from the Office for Budget Responsibility, now that, you know, that exists, to play that independent -- independent role.

Obviously what was happening at this time was more frequent decisions in slightly more improvised ways.

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry to interrupt, Mr Keating.

**Mr Keating**: Not at all, my Lady.

Information sharing, I'm just going to continue with this theme a little bit longer, if we could turn to page 7, please. It suggests that there was the strategic sharing of information by HMT, and I want to ask you about that.

It says this:

"... the Treasury -- shared analysis strategically to support their particular point of view, with the chancellor feeling he needed to 'make the economic case' as a counter to 'the health case' that the health minister was making. This contributed to decision making becoming a tug-of-war in autumn 2020, which led to sub-optimal decision-making."

So this phraseology regarding a tug-of-war in autumn 2020 -- thank you for bringing that up -- was there this binary or separation between science and Health on one side and the economy and Treasury on the other side as we left lockdown 1 and emerged into summer and autumn 2020, from your experience at Number 10?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, I think ... I mean, are you thinking in the September period now?

**Counsel Inquiry**: As we -- as lockdown eased, restrictions eased, and especially entering September onwards, the circuit breaker thereafter, was there this, as these authors described it, a tug-of-war between Treasury on one side and Health on the other side?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think in September obviously cases were picking up, and the emergence of the second wave, perhaps foreshadowed by the experience of other European countries, that's the sort of situation we were -- we were in, and that was a challenge that was faced, you know, over a couple of months, right up until the final decision to do the second lockdown at the end of October, and so it was discussed, you know, multiple times in multiple forums through September, in October, the PM being briefed by the medical -- you know, the Chief Scientific Adviser and Chief Medical Officer meeting independent scientists and I think meeting -- you have heard about from other witnesses, and discussing the circuit breaker idea, and then in committee meetings where ultimately he decided -- the Prime Minister -- not to do the circuit breaker, to do other measures, the rule of six at the start of September, toughening the tier system in October, I think other measures about 22 September as well.

And in -- so discussed in multiple forums, getting information from lots of angles. I think, you know, it's known that the scientific advisers were -- were -- you know, like SAGE, advocated a circuit breaker I think on the 21st --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: And I think it's known or the -- you know, the Chancellor is on record, he did an interview in March 2021 saying he was opposed to the circuit breaker. So I think those positions are -- you probably know them.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, asking your -- giving you the opportunity to give evidence from your perspective as Number 10 as somebody who was synthesising information from an economic perspective, and those discussions which were taking place, the last point on this, which is set out at page 61 of the report, says this:

"Interviewees involved in discussions over social restrictions variously described central decision making for much of 2020 as 'a bit of a Punch and Judy', 'enormously chaotic', 'a tug of war' and simply '[not] a proper bringing together of science, public health and economic considerations'."

Now, is that a fair assessment, from your perspective, of those discussions in the autumn of 2020 especially?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think -- I mean, I've mentioned that the discussions took place in multiple -- in multiple meetings and ahead of the Prime Minister making decisions at sort of different points in time on the circuit breaker idea and then, ultimately, 30 October on the second lockdown, and there were, well, as we said earlier, debates in those meetings.

I think -- I mean, it's also the case that -- I mean, take -- you mentioned sort of the whole period of 2020, the ability of the sort of the Cabinet Office to sort of have a -- its sort of central -- its ability to bring together the analysis from the science and the health and the economic side to inform the advice it was synthesising, it was bringing together, did, as you would expect, from this period, improve over time, through 2020 and into 2021.

So that's my main thought on the last point here.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So is this fair, your evidence is that things improved?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: In terms of the ability -- the bringing together of all of this information. I think it was all on the table at the relevant points, but the sort of sophistication of that analytical integration did improve through 2020 into 2021, informing the second roadmap, and the nature of the sort of overall government operation in 2021 felt a bit different than it might have done in March 2020, and I suppose that's not necessarily a surprise given the nature of the challenge we faced.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We're now going to demonstrate the economic efficiency in use of time, three points, five minutes.

The first point is this, let's open up, please, INQ000273901 at page 373. You've seen this already and it's really just to assist you in relation to a point I'd like to ask you about.

So that's INQ000273901, and that should be page 373.

It relates to this, while that's being brought up, as you've seen this already, is that: was HMT, to your knowledge, the way that it was pressing economic interests in discussions, did it create an environment where the Treasury and the Chancellor were pejoratively termed as "pro death"? Was that a phrase that you heard -- I'm not suggesting you used it -- you heard being used pejoratively in and around Number 10?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I don't recall that phrase, no.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And that there is an entry which you have seen which is in front of you, a hard copy, at a meeting on 25 January 2021, the PM is recorded as saying that he wants Tier 3, March 1, Tier 2, April 1, Tier 1, May 1, and nothing by September, and he ends up by saying the team must "bring in the pro death squad from HMT".

A meeting, an economic meeting, this is Sir Patrick Vallance's dairies, you've got the entry in front of us, I'm sorry you don't have it on the screen in front of you, but do you recall the phraseology by the Prime Minister referring to HMT as the "pro death" squad?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: As I say, I think it refers to a meeting a couple of years ago. I don't recall that specific phrase. I mean, I see that this is from Patrick's notebook, I wouldn't dispute what he has recorded but I don't recall the phrase at all.

I mean, I think -- I mean, is it helpful to say a bit more about what's going on at this time, or do you want to move --

**Counsel Inquiry**: No, no, thank you. I'm just asking for your recollection.

Second, penultimate, point is the interests of the elderly. In the discussions especially in the autumn of 2020, do you recall the Prime Minister referring to the interests of the elderly, how effectively older people should accept their fate and tell the young to get on with life and the economy going.

Was that something in your dialogue with him that emerged in discussions?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I think this is another extract from Patrick's diary on 26 August.

**Counsel Inquiry**: It is.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I mean, I know that --

**Counsel Inquiry**: We can bring that up if you wish. That's INQ000273 --

**Lady Hallett**: We don't need to bother. Did you hear it, Mr Glassborow, or not?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: I mean, this is, I think, from a WhatsApp group that I wasn't part of, on a date -- or time when I was on leave, so I don't have an awareness of this --

**Mr Keating**: I'd like you to just bear with me and listen to the question a little bit more. I'm not suggesting you were on a WhatsApp group, but Sir Patrick Vallance in the two extracts you were shown refers to the word "obsessed", the Prime Minister "obsessed" by this. Was it the case in your -- as the economic conduit dealing with him, that he ever used that phraseology referring to the interests of the elderly?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: No, I don't recall him using --

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm asking for your recollection. It's not written down on a piece of paper.

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: No, no, I don't recall -- I'm just thinking about that period of time. I don't recall that sort of phraseology in the space that I think you're referring to.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Last question, and turning back to lessons learned, and one of the matters in that report which we've touched upon, we don't need to bring this screen up, is whether there should have been an economic or socioeconomic equivalent of SAGE to assist decision-makers with analysis of the trade-offs of decision-making.

I'm going to ask your opinion, because you were at Number 10, now you're back at HMT, what's your view in terms of a recommendation or lessons learned of an economic SAGE, so to speak?

**Mr Stuart Glassborow**: Well, thank you, I mean, I'm aware of the idea, I've seen it come up in some of the other evidence here, it's -- I don't think it was something that was ever formally proposed to the Prime -- as far as I'm aware, to the Prime Minister or indeed something that he proposed to the Treasury, as it were.

But in terms of my perspective, I think -- you know, my understanding is that SAGE itself filled a gap that existed in providing sort of scientific advice on the virus and there's no other element of government that in place, standing function, to do that, and therefore it was obviously necessary for SAGE to take that role.

On the economics, the sort of Treasury exists to do that in some sense. You've got a standing economic unit within the Treasury -- I didn't see the chief economic adviser's evidence earlier, but -- I mean, she may disagree, may have disagreed -- that -- you've got the economic -- who are plugged into the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Bank of England, international groups such as the IMF, the OECD, think tanks, academics, and so in that sense, for the sorts of products we were looking at earlier, like those dashboards, they are bringing together information, data and analysis from all of those sources, following a sort of playbook or way of working that I think has been -- that I would recognise from having been in the Treasury previously and so feels -- feels familiar.

Now, I can obviously understand and I know I think in their corporate witness statement the Treasury referred to sort of, you know, market sensitivities of putting out, you know, certain information at certain times, but, I mean, my own personal reflection is that, you know, in a sort of fast-moving crisis, unprecedented situation such as a pandemic, I could imagine the sharing or testing of some of that in a bit -- some of that work a bit publicly than might normally take place. So I think the function and the role and the work already exists, it's -- well, it links back to your point on transparency earlier.

**Mr Keating**: External transparency.

Mr Glassborow, very grateful.

My Lady, I'm sorry we've encroached beyond lunchtime, but unless you have any questions that's all I wish to ask.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Glassborow, thank you for your help.

We will break now and I shall return at 2.05.
