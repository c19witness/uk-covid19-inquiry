6. Submissions on Behalf of Clinically Vulnerable Families and 13 Pregnancy, Baby and Parent Organisations by Ms Mccabe
=======================================================================================================================

**Ms McCabe**: My Lady, yes, thank you very much.

I act with Adam Wagner and Rosa Polaschek on behalf of two core participants. The first is Clinically Vulnerable Families and the second is 13 Pregnancy, Birthing and Parent Organisations. We are instructed by Slater and Gordon solicitors on behalf of both, and I have Shane Smith in attendance with me today.

My Lady, on behalf of the 13 Pregnancy, Birthing and Parent Organisations I have no substantive submissions to make at this hearing, save to say we're very grateful for the updates from Ms Carey King's Counsel this morning, in particular the Inquiry's aim for disclosure to be complete by the end of June or early July, bearing in mind the school holidays, and also to say that the Pregnancy, Birthing and Parent Organisations are working hard to identify suitable individuals to provide impact evidence to the Inquiry, and they were very grateful to be asked to do so.

My Lady, on behalf of Clinically Vulnerable Families, who I will refer to as CVF, there are five topics I wish to address today.

The first, my Lady, is the inclusion of the clinically vulnerable and clinically extremely vulnerable as a separate equality group.

My Lady, this is a submission which was made by Mr Wagner at the last preliminary hearing, but it's an issue that CVF feel particularly strongly about, and no ruling was made on it, so they have asked me to repeat the submission today.

My Lady, the pandemic, as you'll be aware, had and continues to have a distinct impact on clinically vulnerable people. They remain at higher risk of severe disease from Covid-19 and they've had to make difficult choices about the extent to which they can participate in all facets of public life since public health measures have been withdrawn.

CVF's core concern, my Lady, is that the distinct impact on the clinically vulnerable was insufficiently considered throughout the pandemic, and at present they feel that the clinically vulnerable as a group have practically been forgotten, within the healthcare system but also in wider society.

CVF are therefore keen to ensure that this very serious oversight is not repeated in the Inquiry, and so, in that context, CVF's overarching submission is that the Inquiry must consider clinically vulnerable people with an appreciation of their distinct interests in this module and that it must specifically bear clinically vulnerable people in mind when investigating the healthcare response to Covid-19.

Now, your Ladyship will recall that the Inquiry's terms of reference include an obligation to consider any disparities evident in the impact of the pandemic on different categories of people, and the terms of reference make clear that those categories include but are not limited to those relating to protected characteristics under the Equality Act. So evidently the scope of the categories of people is within the Inquiry's discretion.

My Lady, the Inquiry's equalities and human rights statement on the website currently states that when investigating unequal impact among different groups, the characteristics which will be considered are: groups with protected characteristics, geographical differences, social economic background, occupation and immigration status.

While those are all hugely important groups, CVF were disappointed to see that the clinically vulnerable are not identified as a relevant group or characteristic within that statement, notwithstanding the submissions made on their behalf at the last hearing.

So CVF therefore repeat their submission that the equalities and human rights statement should be amended to add clinical vulnerability to Covid-19 to the list of characteristics which will be considered by the Inquiry when investigating unequal impact among different groups or populations.

Whilst this may appear to be a fairly small step by the Inquiry, CVF submit that amending that statement would be a tangible demonstration of the clinically vulnerable's important place within this Inquiry and will ensure that the mistake of overlooking this group is not repeated in the Inquiry as it too often was during the main phases of the pandemic.

My Lady, my second topic is reasonable adjustments at the substantive hearing in the autumn. CVF are exceptionally grateful to the Inquiry's operations team for the steps taken to enable their in-person participation at preliminary hearings to date. Your Ladyship may be aware that CVF has been engaged in correspondence with the operations team in respect of appropriate reasonable adjustments which will allow CVF members to attend and fully participate in the substantive hearings.

CVF does acknowledge that online attendance at those hearings is possible. However, they're very keen for CVF members to have safe access to the physical space if at all possible and they remain concerned that this will not be possible as matters stand.

CVF will continue to liaise with the operations team in respect of this, and they sincerely hope that a creative solution will be identified to enable their full participation in the substantive hearing.

My Lady, my third topic, expert evidence.

From CVF's perspective, the Inquiry must ensure that it has the evidence necessary to properly consider the impact of the pandemic on clinically vulnerable people as a key demographic. With that in mind, they have two brief points to raise.

The first is a point of clarification on the current expert evidence. CVF are very grateful for the Inquiry's confirmation that some of the experts already instructed will address the challenges faced by the clinically vulnerable. In particular, Professor Snooks and Professor Edwards' report on primary care and emergency pre-hospital care will address issues around the shielding programme. They were very pleased to learn that.

But in addition to the points which were summarised today, which will be addressed by Professor Snooks and Professor Edwards, the Inquiry is invited, if it has not already done so, to instruct those experts to specifically consider the long-term effects of shielding on all shielding people, but in particular, my Lady, the psychosocial effects of shielding. CVF's very strong view, which is supported by its members' lived experience, is that the psychosocial impact of shielding is just as important as any other long-term effect, and that must be addressed in that evidence for the Inquiry to have a full understanding of the shielding programme.

My second point on expert evidence is simply to endorse the submissions made by -- some of the submissions made by the John's Campaign core participant group, and specifically on the instruction of a specific expert in respect of the clinically extremely vulnerable population, albeit if that request is granted CVF would want to feed into the contents of the instructions, and CVF also endorse John's Campaign's submissions in respect of obtaining an expert in respect of hospital-acquired transmission of Covid-19, especially :outline:`airborne hospital-acquired transmission`. So CVF ask that the Inquiry seriously considers those requests.

My fourth and penultimate topic, my Lady, is the importance of Module 3 addressing the impact of Covid-19 on children's experiences of healthcare. CVF have already noted that there is no explicit reference to children in the provisional scope of Module 3, and they are of course aware that there is a separate module upcoming on education and children. However, that does not, in CVF's submission, distract from the need to consider children's particular and distinctive experiences of healthcare as part of Module 3.

We note what was said by Ms Carey King's Counsel this morning in respect of Professor Edwards and Professor Snooks' report specifically, but notwithstanding that, CVF submit that the impact of Covid-19 on children's experiences of healthcare, including clinically vulnerable children, and the impact of shielding or not shielding on clinically vulnerable children, fall within the scope of Module 3, and would be grateful for confirmation of that from the Inquiry.

If the Inquiry does not propose to consider those issues within the purview of Module 3, then CVF seek confirmation of whether they'll be considered in the forthcoming separate module on children.

My Lady, finally, some brief observations on the submissions made by other core participants in respect of spotlight hospitals. CVF hear what was said in respect of that this morning. They do echo the concerns about a rose-tinted corporate view, but they will review the statements with interest when they are disclosed. And, briefly, CVF endorse a specific submission made by Covid Bereaved UK at paragraph 13 of their written submissions, which is that -- the concern that a focus on a very limited number of spotlight hospitals may be at the expense of consideration of wider systemic issues that were faced by the population, for example differences between NHS trusts in respect of their approach to DNACPR and the Covid-19 decision support tool, which is of particular concern to CVF.

My Lady, unless I can assist further, at 3 minutes to 1, those are my submissions on behalf of CVF.

**Lady Hallett**: Excellent timing, Ms McCabe. Thank you very much indeed for your submissions.
