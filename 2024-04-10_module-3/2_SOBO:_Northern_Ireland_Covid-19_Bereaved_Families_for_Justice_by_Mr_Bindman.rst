2. Submissions on Behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Bindman
=====================================================================================================

**Mr Bindman**: My Lady, I appear on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice. You've received our written submissions and I propose to use the short time that I have to bring to the fore some key topics on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved.

As you are aware, uniquely in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland has a fully integrated system of personal social services with healthcare, referred to as "health and social care". The Health and Social Care (Reform) Act 2009 created a single regional Health and Social Care Board. This single regional Health and Social Care Board, working in conjunction with the Public Health Agency, commissioned services to meet assessed need and promote general health and wellbeing. These services were provided by six newly established health and social care trusts: Belfast's, Northern, South Eastern, Southern, Western and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service HSC Trust; along with other HSE arm's length bodies.

Each health and social care trust was accountable for its performance and for ensuring that appropriate assurance mechanisms were in place. This obligation rested with the Health and Social Care trusts' board of directors. It was the responsibility of the Health and Social Care trust board to manage local performance and to manage emerging issues in the first instance. The -- and I'll call them HSCT boards for short, the HSCT boards remain responsible for performance management and assurance in respect of all of the HSCT's activities.

There has been further modification in the Health and Social Care Act 2022 but the background prior to 2022 is important as it lays the foundation for many matters which I seek to bring to your attention today. Specifically in the context that many of our clients believe that each of the trusts or the trust areas functioned inadequately during the pandemic, none more so than in hospital settings and care homes. Our clients have genuine concerns about the trusts' guidance, standard of care, implementation of visitation, family liaison, end of life care and DNR and DNACPR protocols and the stark lack of consistency on these issues across the trusts.

Much if not all of the inconsistency across the trusts stems from the fragmented and complex health and social care structure operating for a relatively small population. This granulated structure has led to the existence of different policies and procedures and thus differing standards of care and treatment across the trusts.

I lay out that background, my Lady, to give some context to the submissions that I intend to make.

The Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice feel strongly that there should, if possible, be a forensic examination as to how each health and social care trust responded to the pandemic, with emphasis on the compelling differences in standards of care and approaches taken.

To this end, as you will have noted from correspondence from PA Duffy Solicitors on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice to the Inquiry, we implore it to send Rule 9 requests for information to the chief executives of each of the five health trusts in Northern Ireland.

In light of the division of the trust areas, and on the eve of Module 2C, tranches of disclosure support the commonly held view amongst our group that there were different care and treatment standards employed across the HSC trusts due to different policies and procedures being employed. The result, we say, was a postcode lottery.

Examples from our client base include patients who were unable to receive IV antibiotic treatment at home outside the Belfast trust. This particular client's mother had to be admitted to hospital for this treatment and subsequently went on to contract Covid-19 in hospital. The family were told that if she was in the Belfast trust, IV antibiotics could have been administered at home, meaning that there was clearly an unnecessary exposure of the vulnerable or a vulnerable person to the virus.

Another example of obvious divergence of approach concerns the expectations, rules and protocol for testing of trust staff. Many of our clients have flagged this as a matter of particular concern, particularly in relation to domiciliary care. Our clients observe the screening of staff providing domiciliary care was not prioritised to the same extent as it was for staff in clinical or care settings.

Many of our clients reasonably believe that domiciliary staff members brought Covid-19 into their vulnerable family member's home with little or no precautions taken to prevent the spread of infection, including not wearing PPE and giving inadequate responses as to why they were not wearing the same.

In our submission, the trust executives ought to be called to the Inquiry to answer and to explain who was responsible for overseeing the drawing up and implementation of preventative standards for domiciliary care. It is only with first-hand accounts given by the relevant heads of the trust divisions that there can being a full and proper examination of the decision-making employed, the reasons for the same and an assessment of the outcomes, both intended and unintended, if not obvious, of those decisions.

What is not clear to our client base is whether there was any effective collaboration between trust executives, it appears on the face of it there was not, and if not, why not. We are keen to understand the level of communication between each of the five chief executives and their relationships. What were their reasons for employing certain decisions over others? Were experiences and lessons pooled and shared or did the trusts work in silo? The resultant effect, as referred to previously, was a postcode lottery.

By way of example of some of the experiences of our group, they query why some trusts employed liaison officers to keep families updated and others did not. Communication or the lack thereof is a key theme for the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, whose friends and family were not properly and adequately appraised of the care and even deaths of their loved ones and, as a consequence, are left to suffer the purgatory of the unknown.

This has understandably added to the trauma of their loved ones' passing. One of our group, Sarah Todd(?), lost her mother in 2021, her mother died in hospital. Ms Todd was not informed that her mother's condition had deteriorated. Ms Todd was not informed that her mother had even passed away.

So I turn then, my Lady, to deal with the issue of spotlighting hospitals. Whilst recognising the enormous pressures of time this module already faces and that a considered decision has been made to choose the two largest hospitals in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice are apprehensive that the focus on these hospitals will inevitably be at the exclusion of other hospitals, particularly given that the hospitals chosen are situated in the two largest cities in Northern Ireland whereas 37% of the population in Northern Ireland live in rural areas, such that there are other hospitals that serve those communities. The product of the current spotlight hospitals information may not be representative of the experience faced by our clients. Of the six health and social care trusts I have referred to, the current identified spotlight hospitals will only come under the umbrella of the Belfast and Western Trusts and do not examine the decision-making and, importantly, the impact of those decisions on three other trusts.

Because of the differences in decisions made by different trusts, a one-size-fits-all approach simply cannot apply.

For example, the Inquiry may well be interested in a serious incident which was declared in the Southern Health and Social Care Trust as a result of three clusters of the Covid-19 virus at Craigavon and Daisy Hill Hospital between August and October 2020. In the three outbreaks a total of 15 of 32 patients with Covid died. These included specifically the haematology ward outbreak at Craigavon, where seven of the 14 patients with the virus died, in the male medical ward outbreak at Daisy Hill, six of the 13 patients died, and in the 4S ward outbreak at Craigavon, two of the five patients with Covid died.

A serious adverse incident report was published in September 2023 and found that the lack of regular screening of in-patients or healthcare workers hampered early detection of hospital-acquired Covid infections. It also cited insufficient and inadequate isolation facilities, overcrowding and inadequate space for social distancing in the emergency department of Craigavon Hospital.

Naturally, questions arise as to how the outbreak compared to the decision-making and outworkings in other trust areas. If there were other systems in place that protected other hospitals, why were they not adopted in the Southern health trust? Were the systems that were adopted different to the other trusts? Can it be said that the differences led to this significant incident?

It follows, in our submission, that without some flexibility there is a danger that the unique healthcare structure in Northern Ireland may result in the Inquiry being unable to sufficiently contrast the differing approaches made by health and social care trusts. For that reason, we ask that consideration is given to adding spotlight hospitals to the current list and potentially considering three or four hospitals in total across the five different health and social care trusts. We've identified those in Antrim and Craigavon as being the appropriate hospitals.

Finally, my Lady, and on a more general note, we seek some clarification regarding matters raised about the crossover of issues in earlier modules.

At the preliminary hearing for Module 1 on 25 April 2023, Mr Keith King's Counsel clarified that preparedness in hospitals and care homes was not an issue which would be explored beyond general terms in respect of the UK Government and the devolved administrations declaring how hospitals and care homes should prepare for civil emergencies and pandemics. Principally:

"... [a] more detailed examination of preparedness in hospitals and care homes, especially at an operational level, must be for healthcare and care sector modules."

That is a quote.

We welcome that clarification, but now, on the cusp of Module 3, seek further explanation as to how the close interplay that Module 3, the impacts on healthcare systems in the four nations of the UK, and the outworkings of particular decisions made by respective healthcare systems, cross or span into issues that come under the rubric for Module 6, the care sector.

By way of example, in a letter dated 3 April 2020, the health trusts wrote to the care home registered providers clarifying the hospital discharge protocol regarding testing, making clear that there was no expectation that patients are tested for Covid-19 before discharge from hospital to a care home. Less than three weeks later, and by 22 April 2020, there were 297 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in 60 care homes in Northern Ireland.

In respect of the lived experiences of our client base, in the witness statement prepared by Marian Reynolds(?) for Module 2C, she recounts how her aunt was discharged from hospital in poor health with effectively the same care package that had been in place before she was admitted to hospital, with no adaptation for the significant deterioration in her aunt's health, or that the family support that had previously been there was absent because they too were suffering from Covid. When the health trust were challenged about this, the family were offered an anecdote about another person who was discharged on the same care package. This was cold comfort to the family, who knew that the arrangements were demonstrably inadequate, and put Ms Reynolds' aunt at serious risk. Whilst failings of this nature may have been present prior to the pandemic, the impact of the reduced oversight of mechanisms during the pandemic compounded the problem and elevated the risk.

So, my Lady, it's for those reasons that we ask the Inquiry to consider our request in respect of the health and social care trusts and the spotlighting hospitals.

Unless, my Lady, there are any matters which I can assist with, those are the submissions.
