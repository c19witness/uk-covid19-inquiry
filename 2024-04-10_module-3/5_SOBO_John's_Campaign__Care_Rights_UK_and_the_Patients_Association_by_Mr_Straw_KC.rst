5. Submissions on Behalf of John's Campaign, Care Rights UK and the Patients Association by Mr Straw KC
=======================================================================================================

**Mr Straw**: Thank you. My Lady, I'd like to address eight topics this morning.

First, the need for people to be central to this questions. The very first line of the NHS Constitution for England is "The NHS belongs to the people". The reason why the constitution repeatedly makes clear that the patient will be at the heart of everything the NHS does is that this is the most effective way of organising a health system. In the same way we submit that the most effective way that this module can examine the impact of Covid-19 on the health system is to place people at its heart. It is only by focusing on the lived experiences of individual patients or staff that this Inquiry will fully understand and learn from the pandemic and from its response.

In consequence, we warmly welcome the indications from the Inquiry in this module that it will focus on individuals. However, we are concerned with the approach that appears to be taken to spotlight hospitals in this respect, and I'll come back to that in a moment, if I may.

The second topic is the issues to be investigated. We made some submissions about the Inquiry's provisional list of issues previously, for the purpose of the last preliminary hearing. There has been no specific response to those submissions, and the timescale for a revised list of issues is now said to be the end of May. We would invite the Inquiry, if possible, to produce the revised list of issues sooner than the end of May, if it can do, because this would provide assurance to core participants that their submissions are being addressed and it's also very important to guide future preparation.

In light of recent developments, the CPs, our CPs, have further submissions about what issues should be investigated.

So, firstly, healthcare outside hospital. The hospital setting, while of course is very important, should not be given disproportionate attention in this module. It's important to also investigate the impact of Covid and the response to it on healthcare outside hospitals and to consider healthcare holistically across the range of relevant contexts. Healthcare is provided in hospitals, but also in GP surgeries, by community care, at home, in residential care, in hospices and in a number of other settings. As the NHS Constitution for England states, at 5:

"The NHS works across organisational boundaries ... The NHS is an integrated system of organisations and services bound together by the principles and values reflected in the Constitution. The NHS is committed to working jointly with other local authority services, other public sector organisations and a wide range of private and voluntary sector organisations to provide and deliver improvements in health and wellbeing."

We submit that that approach again should be reflected in the Inquiry. An investigation which encompasses healthcare outside the hospital is important for two key reasons.

Firstly, non-hospital healthcare involves critical services which are provided to a very large number of people. For example, the NHS provides some 95 million contacts in community services each year. Restricted access to community services for many meant that non-Covid-related health needs were left unidentified and untreated and this led to serious illnesses and deaths.

The second reason is that healthcare outside hospital raises specific and different issues with respect to Covid and the response. To take some broad and basic examples, the risks of Covid infection were different outside hospital. Effective infection prevention and control measures were different, and the dangers of not providing non-Covid healthcare and treatment were also different.

We note that a number of other CPs have made similar submissions to this for the purpose of this hearing, including the British Medical Association at paragraph 28, and CATA, paragraphs 3.1 to 3.2, which we endorse.

The next additional issue is regulation and oversight. Issue 2 in this module's provisional list of issues is core decision-making and leadership. We urge the Inquiry to include within this the way in which systems for complaints, regulation and oversight of healthcare operated during the pandemic. Those systems were suspended or otherwise hugely disrupted. It's difficult to see that that was appropriate, since regulation and oversight were no less important during a pandemic and this ought to be examined.

The third additional issue is end of life healthcare or other care. Palliative care for patients with Covid-19 in acute hospitals is issue 5(b) within the list of issues for this module. It's unclear whether other forms of end of life or palliative care are covered. These are important topics that were overlooked during the pandemic and which ought, we say, to be covered at some stage by this Inquiry.

There are a number of issues of public concern in this area, which include the following four:

First, the lack of end-of-life care for non-Covid conditions, a lack of end-of-life care for any condition outside of acute hospitals. This left many people to die alone and without support.

The second issue of concern, the reasons for the lack of end-of-life care, these may include entrenched systemic inadequacies and that older and disabled people were considered to be expendable.

The third issue, restrictions on visits from carers and loved ones.

And fourthly, whether those delivering palliative care outside hospitals were provided with sufficient PPE and other support.

So we invite the Inquiry to make clear that it will investigate these issues at some point and we also invite it to consider calling expert evidence on end-of-life care. This may be obtained from the Cicely Saunders Institute at King's College London, and in particular from Professor Irene Higginson, and we'll forward a copy of her CV to the Inquiry so it may be considered.

The fourth and final additional issue is that we agree with Mr Weatherby King's Counsel in urging you to include preparedness for health and social care within this module.

The next topic is spotlight hospitals. While this is a potentially useful aspect of this investigation, we submit that it should not be exclusive and should not preclude a full and proper investigation of the relevant systemic issues by other means.

CTI's note for this hearing at paragraph 9 appears to recognise this and that this won't be exclusive, but to give an example, topic (h) in paragraph 13 of CTI's note is visiting restrictions. One of the concerns of the CPs who I represent is that visiting guidelines were interpreted and applied very differently between different hospitals and other healthcare settings. In some places they were applied very restrictively and this led to serious harm. Some examples of this are set out in our witness statement, paragraphs 37 to 39.

Now, while this might be examined to a degree by the spotlight hospital process, it's unlikely to be fully understood by that route, so we submit other evidence is necessary in order to fully investigate it.

Now, this morning Ms Carey King's Counsel appeared to suggest that evidence will not be taken from patients or their families in respect of the spotlight hospitals, only staff. Now, if I've interpreted that correctly, then we would object to that approach. For the reasons I gave at the start, we submit that it's very important that evidence is taken from patients. Without that lived experience, the perspective from spotlight hospitals will be one-sided and will overlook key issues.

The next topic is mental health. As to the investigation of adult mental health by this Inquiry, the November 2023 update note stated that, while this won't be examined in this module, Module 3, it will be investigated in another module or other modules.

It's not clear which module will examine this important issue, or why it doesn't fit most obviously within this module, and that's why I'm raising this again now.

We respectfully submit that it is important that adult mental health is investigated. The pandemic response restrictions on visits, for example, had a very severe impact on those with psychiatric problems in hospitals or otherwise. Mind's submissions for this hearing give some examples of this at paragraph 19, and our witness statement gives other examples. Mental health healthcare is an integral part of the broader healthcare system and we agree with Mind that, as a consequence, it should fall within this module. In any event, we respectfully invite the Inquiry to confirm in which module this will be investigated.

The next topic is further evidence. We make six suggestions for further evidence, whether this comes from experts or from other witnesses who are able to help. This is set out in detail in our written submissions, so I'll just briefly summarise and add a few additional points, if I may.

So firstly, the use of do not resuscitate or do not attempt CPR notices. This is issue 6(b) within the provisional list of issues for this module. There is evidence that these notices were issued on a very wide scale on an inappropriate basis, that is without consulting the person and/or their representative, and it's arguable that there were broad systemic issues behind this, for example age, disability or other discrimination, or at least that there were inadequate local or national guidelines. The examination of this issue we say would benefit from a witness, again not necessarily an expert witness, but someone who can digest and summarise the complex evidence as to how these notices were used inappropriately across a broad range of settings and can help identify whether there were systemic flaws behind that misuse.

The second new area of evidence is access to healthcare outside NHS premises. CTI's note indicates that Professors Snooks and Edwards will examine a number of aspects of healthcare outside hospitals and we welcome that. Ms Carey King's Counsel has partly dealt with this earlier today concerning mental health, but we invite this Inquiry to make clear that it has instructed the professors to include healthcare provision in as full a range of settings as possible outside hospital, so including community settings, in people's homes, care settings and so on. As touched upon above, there were specific and different issues of concerns applicable to healthcare outside NHS premises.

The third area of evidence, the clinically extremely vulnerable population. This population is covered by issue 11 on the Inquiry's list of issues. We invite the Inquiry to obtain evidence, potentially expert evidence, about certain subissues within this point, namely (i) whether the conditions which were considered to be extremely vulnerable were appropriately categorised as such; (ii) whether the restrictions on access to healthcare and other matters which resulted from this categorisation were proportionate; and (iii) whether alternative but less onerous means of protecting these individuals from Covid should have been adopted.

The fourth area of additional evidence is access to and impact on healthcare services for those with learning disabilities and cognitive impairments. Again, Ms Carey has touched upon this this morning. The pandemic response had a particular and severe impact on people with learning disabilities and cognitive impairments, for example with dementia, not least in accessing healthcare. People with learning disabilities were around eight times more likely to die during the pandemic. This isn't a peripheral healthcare issue; it is central.

There are a number of specific and discrete issues of concern which govern this group which, we respectfully submit, ought to be investigated in this module. They include lack of access to familiar caregivers and widespread failure to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that this group of people could access healthcare. We therefore invite the Inquiry to consider investigating this issue and with that in mind we suggest an expert who would be able to help do so, Dr Emma Wolverson, clinical psychologist and reader in ageing and dementia at the University of Hull, and again we'll forward a copy of her CV to the Inquiry.

The fifth area of evidence, carers in healthcare, we submit that this module ought to examine the critical and inseparable role of carers, including family carers in healthcare. Given the specific and often overlooked role that they played, this module may benefit from expert evidence about unpaid carers in the NHS.

Then the sixth area of additional evidence is nosocomial transmission in hospitals. This falls within issue 8 in the Inquiry's list of issues, and we invite the Inquiry to consider whether expert evidence would assist in respect of this issue, particularly in relation to certain specific topics that are set out in our written submissions.

The final two areas of -- topics I'd like to cover are, firstly, cross-module issues, so issues which cut across two different modules or more. NHS have invited the Inquiry to clarify how issues which cut across more than one module will be examined and where the dividing lines are. An example is the DNACPR issue.

Now, if the Inquiry will do as NHS England asks, we invite it to bear in mind that in a number of ways health and social care are inseparable, and this means that for some cross-cutting issues it's not proper to investigate the issue in isolation in each setting. Do not attempt CPR as an example, it appears that the bodies/systems and other factors that are responsible for the widespread misuse of these forms are inseparable and it's therefore necessary in order to properly understand this issue to consider it across the whole range of health and social care settings.

Some other issues, however, might be investigated separately in more than one module. End-of-life care is an example. It appears that this Inquiry intends to investigate it in both Module 3 and Module 6, and we endorse that approach, given that those who are responsible for it and for the issues are broadly separable. However, we would invite the Inquiry to maintain a degree of flexibility in light of the evidence which is obtained.

The last brief point, if I may, is that in -- concerns expert questions and instructions. In Module 6 this Inquiry has decided that it will provide to core participants the questions it gives to experts. There are obvious good reasons for doing so, which we've set out in the past. We respectfully invite this module to reconsider its position and to take the same approach as will Module 6.

My Lady, unless there is anything else, those are our submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Straw, very grateful.

Ms McCabe.
