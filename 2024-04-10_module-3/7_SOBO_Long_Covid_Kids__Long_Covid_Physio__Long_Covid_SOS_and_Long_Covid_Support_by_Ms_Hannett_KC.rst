7. Submissions on Behalf of Long Covid Kids, Long Covid Physio, Long Covid SOS and Long Covid Support by Ms Hannett KC
======================================================================================================================

**Ms Hannett**: I appear on behalf of the four Long Covid groups, Long Covid Kids, Long Covid SOS, Long COVID Physio and Long Covid Support.

I'm assisted by Ms Iengar and Ms Sivakumaran, and I'm instructed by Jane Ryan of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors.

The Inquiry has our written submissions. I propose to focus on key issues for our clients. That focus is not intended to diminish the importance of the remaining points raised in our submissions, but the Inquiry has them and will no doubt consider them with care.

With that in mind, I propose to make submissions on five broad topics: first, the scope of Module 3; second, the Rule 9 process to date; third, disclosure; fourth, the length of the hearing; and fifth, the timetable for the Inquiry's recommendations.

The first topic, my Lady, is a request for clarification as to the scope of Module 3 in three respects. These points are set out in paragraphs 5 to 16 of our written submissions, but in summary are as follows.

The first point of scope is that the Long Covid groups seek a clarificatory ruling as to where the impact of vaccines on Long Covid will be investigated, and whether that is to be in Module 3 or in Module 4. There is evidence that vaccines both reduce the severity of existing Long Covid and reduce, albeit not wholly prevent, new cases of Long Covid developing. These are matters that must be explored by the Inquiry, not least because people continue to suffer from Long Covid and its effects.

My clients made submissions at the last preliminary hearing asking for confirmation that these issues would be considered in Module 3, given the Inquiry's decision to refuse them core participant status in Module 4, and that the reasons for that refusal included the point that the characterisation and identification of post-Covid condition, including Long Covid, and its diagnosis and treatment, falls within Module 3.

The Long Covid groups note the distinction drawn in the second preliminary hearing ruling between the development of therapeutics up to the point of use, a matter for Module 4, and the use of therapeutics, a matter for Module 3, but respectfully ask that it put be beyond doubt in your ruling on preliminary hearing 3 that Module 3 will include an examination of the impact of vaccinations on Long Covid.

That's the first point of scope, my Lady.

The second point of scope is a request for confirmation that the Inquiry will consider the economic impact of Long Covid on healthcare workers, in particular on their ability to continue working and the consequential financial impacts and, further, that the Inquiry will investigate the impact on healthcare workers of the decision not to designate Long Covid as an occupational disease.

My Lady, you ruled at the last preliminary hearing that issues relating to the designation of Covid-19 as a disability and the creation of a compensation scheme were out of scope, but these are two separate points, my Lady. As to the economic impacts, the Long Covid groups maintain that a proper focus on the physical health and wellbeing of healthcare staff, as required by issue 7(a), necessarily includes an examination of the wider economic impacts for healthcare workers who contracted Covid-19 and who developed Long Covid.

Similarly, that Long Covid was not recognised as an occupational disease has implications for issue 8(d), namely RIDDOR reporting requirements for healthcare workers. The RIDDOR regulations prescribe the occupational diseases which must be reported. Long Covid is not one of them. There is evidence as to the under-reporting of workplace Covid-19 via RIDDOR already before the Inquiry, both from the Scottish TUC and the Health and Safety Executive, and indeed the Health and Safety Executive witness statement notes that as of 31 October 2023 only 36 RIDDOR reports for Long Covid had been received.

In the absence of a designation of Long Covid as an occupational disease, trusts are left with a discretion as to whether to report or not, and we say it's artificial to look at RIDDOR reporting but not to look at the decision-making around whether or not Long Covid should be designated as an occupational disease, and we say this is key to making proper recommendations as to the prevention of the spread of Covid and an understanding of how best to manage workplace safety.

For these reasons we ask that the Inquiry make clear that both of these points, economic impact and Long Covid as an occupational disease, are in the scope of Module 3.

The final point of scope concerns the manner in which the Inquiry will investigate the barriers to patients, both adults and children, accessing Long Covid services and clinics and the variation in the quality of those services.

The Long Covid groups will in due course invite the Inquiry to make findings as to the adequacy of those services and recommendations as to how they could be improved, and we ask now for clarification as to how evidence to address these issues will be obtained.

One possibility, as we suggest in our written submissions, would be to apply an equivalent approach to Long Covid clinics as that being applied to spotlight hospitals. We note the submissions of Counsel to the Inquiry this morning about the lack of need or lack of perceived need to expand the spotlight hospital approach to other services, given the totality of the evidence, but we say that equivalent evidence does not appear presently to be before the Inquiry in respect of Long Covid services and we ask the Inquiry to give that some further consideration.

In summary, on the first topic of scope, the Long Covid groups say that all three points are fundamental to the proper investigation of Long Covid in the healthcare system. They ask, first, the Inquiry to confirm that they will be dealt with in Module 3, and if not, for the Inquiry to confirm in which module they will be addressed.

My Lady, that's the first topic.

The second topic concerns the Rule 9 process and we address this in paragraphs 18 to 21 of our written submissions. Two key points arise on which I wish to address you in oral submissions.

First, the Long Covid groups understand that necessarily the Inquiry will focus on the healthcare response at a relatively high level, but the detail does, in our submission, remain important, and we regret to note that the witness statements disclosed to date that address Long Covid provide evidence at such a high level of generality that no meaningful conclusions can be drawn from them.

So, for example, it appears that none of the Rule 9 recipients have been specifically asked to comment on Long Covid in children. As a result, none of the witness statements disclosed to date make reference to this, even the statement from the Royal College of General Practitioners and the statement from Public Health Scotland, and we also note that morning that Counsel to the Inquiry confirmed that the expert report on pre-hospital care will not comment on children's access to healthcare.

For the avoidance of doubt, we don't accept that those kinds of gaps can properly be plugged by the use of the Rule 10 process. There is limited time for the hearings, which will inevitably limit the number and scope of the Rule 10 questions that can be asked. Further, these aren't points of clarification. They rather reflect a broader need for evidence to be sufficiently detailed in the first place, and indeed we note Counsel to the Inquiry's reminder this morning that pre-Rule 10 questions need to be proportionate and focused.

The Long Covid groups do wish to assist the Inquiry in this respect and to this end we will continue the correspondence that has been started directly with the Inquiry's legal team with suggestions of where further detail is required.

The second key point, my Lady, on the Rule 9 process concerns Rule 9 statements for the spotlight hospitals. We join cause with many of the other core participants to note that these must go further than just the chief medical officer or equivalent. In particular, my clients invite the Inquiry to seek evidence from a range of frontline healthcare workers, including those privately contracted by the NHS in the spotlight hospitals.

My clients welcomed Counsel to the Inquiry's clarification this morning that the evidence sought from spotlight hospitals includes a number of workers suffering from Long Covid and the varying methods of support offered by hospitals, and further we welcome the clarification that the issues raised include problems with the physical condition of the estate, infection protection and control guidelines, narrow corridors and :outline:`poor ventilation`.

We note Counsel to the Inquiry's assurance that they're satisfied that the evidence obtained is not rose-tinted but we are concerned there's a real risk this approach may lead to not providing a balanced evidential picture of the issues that affect affected healthcare workers. The Inquiry will only have one side of the picture, and it's unclear how that evidence will be tested.

So we therefore repeat our request for the Inquiry to expand their request of the spotlight hospitals beyond one individual statement and to seek evidence from a variety of sources, such as patient groups, professional bodies and trade unions, so that core participants may be satisfied that the Inquiry is receiving a balanced picture.

Further, in this respect, we endorse the submissions made this morning by Mr Weatherby that the evidence sought from spotlight hospitals should include preparedness. Questions around applicable national planning, infection protection and control, testing, staffing and support for healthcare workers are of central concern.

As we outline in our written submission, the Long Covid groups' experience is that of a healthcare system unprepared to protect healthcare staff from developing Long Covid and unprepared to manage and support healthcare staff who suffered from Long Covid.

My Lady, the third topic concerns disclosure. We have dealt with this in paragraphs 22 to 23 of our written submissions. We welcome the significant amount of disclosure that the Inquiry has provided to date, but, again, we join cause with the other core participants in noting that it remains imperative that the reminder of the witness statements are provided with sufficient time to allow the Long Covid groups and the other core participants sufficient time to prepare properly for the Module 3 hearing.

To this end we invite the Inquiry to do two things. First, to ensure that most or all of the disclosure is received by the end of June 2024 at the latest, and we welcomed the comments of Counsel to the Inquiry this morning to that end. But, second, to provide a timetable or roadmap now indicating when particular witness statements and underlying material are likely to be provided, to enable both my clients and other core participants to properly prepare and marshall their resources.

My Lady, the fourth topic concerns the length of the hearing. We address this in paragraph 24 of our written submissions. Again, like other core participants, we are concerned about the adequacy of the 40-day allocation for the Module 3 hearing, and in particular the Long Covid groups note the importance of there being a sufficient exploration of Long Covid, not least because people continue to contract Long Covid and suffer its avoidable impacts.

We say that the current timetable gives rise to a real risk of there being insufficient time to ensure Long Covid receives the focus it requires, and we respectfully ask the Inquiry to keep the timetable under review and to monitor, in the light of the evidence that's received, whether it remains satisfied that Long Covid issues, amongst others, can be fairly and thoroughly undertaken within Module 3 in the scheduled time period.

If Long Covid cannot be dealt with fully in the current Module 3 timetable, including the matters of scope that I began these submissions with, the Inquiry is asked to consider whether Long Covid should be dealt with in a separate freestanding module, as suggested by the Royal College of Nursing.

My Lady, my fifth and final topic concerns the Inquiry's recommendations. My clients welcome your recommendation for a monitoring process, including that the institutions responsible for implementing the recommendations should respond within six months. The recommendations are urgent, and have immediate and ongoing relevance, given that people continue to contract Long Covid.

In conclusion, the Long Covid groups look forward to assisting the Inquiry in the Module 3 hearing, but unless I can assist you further, my Lady, those are the submissions on behalf of the Long Covid groups.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much for your help.

Right, who is next? Ms Sen Gupta. There you are, hiding at the back.
