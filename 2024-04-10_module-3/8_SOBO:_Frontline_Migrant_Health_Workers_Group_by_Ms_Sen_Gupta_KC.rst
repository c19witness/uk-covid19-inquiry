8. Submissions on Behalf of the Frontline Migrant Health Workers Group by Ms Sen Gupta KC
=========================================================================================

**Ms Sen Gupta**: My Lady, I am.

My Lady, I appear on behalf of the Frontline Migrant Health Workers Group, together with my learned friend Piers Marquis. We are instructed by the Public Interest Law Centre. The group is comprised of United Voices of the World, Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain, and Kanlungan Filipino Consortium.

We take this opportunity to highlight briefly some of the points made in our written submissions. We've divided up our oral submissions into those on the substance of the evidence your Ladyship ought to hear as part of Module 3, and those on process and procedure in respect of the public hearings listed to begin in September and timely preparation for those hearings.

In relation to substance, I address our proposals in relation to, first, the scope of the expert evidence; second, the scope of the evidence from spotlight hospitals; and, third, the scope of the issues in Module 3.

In relation to process, we note CTI's helpful update on disclosure, for which we're grateful. I will briefly touch on, first, the need for position statements from state CPs; second, the length of the public hearings; and, third, the need for restriction orders for vulnerable witnesses, as appropriate.

My Lady, turning then first to substance and expert evidence.

As your Ladyship is aware, one of the systemic issues of particular concern to our clients is the impact of outsourcing on the NHS in the context of the pandemic. This is about the use of contract workers as well as NHS employees within NHS hospitals. For the avoidance of any doubt, it is not about the use of private hospitals. The Inquiry has received our separate written representations that your Ladyship and CPs would be assisted by the instruction of an expert in this area.

There have been significant concerns raised from within the NHS about the impact of this outsourcing on the healthcare system and those working in it, in particular with regard to unfavourable contract terms, working conditions and the overall impact on healthcare efficiency.

Clearly, we submit, this is all highly pertinent to Module 3's scope. We submit that your Ladyship and the Inquiry would be greatly assisted by instructing such an expert, and invite your Ladyship's ruling in this regard.

Second, spotlight hospitals.

We submit that evidence from the spotlight hospitals should not be limited to senior managers. Evidence should also be obtained from frontline staff in both clinical and non-clinical roles, including those in outsourced positions and migrant workers with employment-dependent visas. They ought to be heard, given the crucially important role they played during the pandemic.

Further, we have identified in our written submissions some particular points which we submit should be covered and we have explained why we say that is the case. I need not repeat those submissions orally, and refer your Ladyship to them.

Third, on substance, we support the submissions of Mind and FEMHO and the John's Campaign CP group on the need for access to adult mental health services to be included as a key area of examination in Module 3. The impact of the pandemic on mental health generally and the mental health of our clients' members in particular was extremely significant. Your Ladyship and CTI have already reflected this at paragraph 7(b) of the provisional list of issues, for which we're grateful.

Our clients' members carried the stress of an understaffed healthcare system and worked through their fear, uncertainty and exhaustion to provide essential services in the pandemic response. The trauma of working on the frontline of a pandemic, unprotected both physically and contractually, cannot be understated. The consequent impact on the ability of the healthcare systems to respond to the pandemic, as a result of health workers' declining mental health, is paramount to the task at hand in this module. Examination of the impact of the pandemic on healthcare ought, we respectfully submit, to include an examination of the impact on access to adult mental health as well as treatment for physical health conditions.

My Lady, process.

First, position statements from state CPs.

We invite your Ladyship to direct that the state CPs prepare and submit position statements in advance of the public hearings in order that CPs have sufficient notice of their respective positions and are able to prepare accordingly.

Second, length of the public hearings.

Like many other CPs, we are concerned that ten weeks will not be enough for the public hearings, given the breadth of this module, though we note what CTI has said in this regard.

Third, and finally, restriction orders for vulnerable witnesses.

Many of our groups' members are in precarious employment or have leave to remain directly tied to their employment. They are thereby exposed to potential repercussions should they provide impact evidence to your Ladyship on systemic failures.

They have important evidence to give to your Ladyship. By way of example, one staff nurse worked on the Covid and non-Covid wards from the outset of the pandemic, she contracted Covid at work and had to be signed off after developing Long Covid. She raised concerns about PPE early in the pandemic and was ignored and reprimanded by senior managers. She witnessed discriminatory treatment of Filipino and other BAME and migrant staff in the hospital. She has not received adequate support from her employer since being diagnosed with Long Covid.

By way of further example, we refer to two outsourced cleaners. During the pandemic, they raised concerns that they were being instructed to work on Covid wards without adequate training and without prior warning of contamination risk. There was also a notable lack of PPE, lateral flow tests, and access to vaccinations. They were given no time to wash or disinfect themselves before being sent to clean other non-Covid wards.

They raised additional concerns that cleaners who contracted Covid-19 were not paid when self-isolating. This had led to outsourced cleaners who were unable to afford the unpaid sick leave, continuing to work whilst unwell. They did not have access to Covid-19 vaccinations, whereas the directly employed NHS hospital cleaners did. The vaccination programme appeared to function as a two-tier system which treated employees as more important than outsourced staff, despite their shared risk of exposure. It was only through pursuing a grievance process with the hospital that IWGB was able to secure vaccinations for these workers.

We request that your Ladyship hears impact evidence from these vulnerable individuals and we request that these vulnerable individuals are suitably protected from their further public service in giving such evidence to your Ladyship's Inquiry by restriction orders as appropriate.

My Lady, in conclusion, we're very grateful to your Ladyship and to the Inquiry team for all your considerable dedication to this module. We will continue to assist the Inquiry in whatever ways we can.

Those are the submissions of the Frontline Migrant Health Workers Group. My Lady, unless I can be of any further assistance.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed for your help, Ms Sen Gupta, very grateful.

I saw the lectern arrive in good time. You're obviously very ready to go, Mr Odogwu, thank you.
