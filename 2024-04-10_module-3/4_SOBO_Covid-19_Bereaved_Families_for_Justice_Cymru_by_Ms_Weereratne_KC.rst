4. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru by Ms Weereratne KC
============================================================================================

**Ms Weereratne**: Trying to make myself seen and heard.

Good morning, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Good morning.

**Ms Weereratne**: Aswini Weereratne, I appear on behalf of Cymru Covid Bereaved Families for Justice. You have our written submissions on which we rely this morning, and I'd like to address four points in addition. Firstly, on section 21 notices, we note that a section 21 notice has been served on the Welsh Government Health and Social Services Group. Non-compliance and lateness have been ongoing issues throughout this Inquiry, and on previous modules as well with the Welsh Government. In submissions for the last preliminary hearing in September 2023 on this module, the Welsh Government stated its commitment to co-operate fully with the Inquiry and that two detailed responses to Rule 9 requests had already been provided. Our clients are disappointed, therefore, and angered to hear that, in spite of reassures given, the Welsh Government's compliance has necessitated a section 21 notice from my Lady.

Secondly, then, I would like to turn to spotlight evidence and spotlight hospitals, and this is a very important issue and of some concern to our clients. We have had lengthy correspondence on this issue with the Inquiry legal team since early February. Our clients are grateful for the time that the Inquiry has given them on this issue, and also grateful for Ms Carey's submissions this morning and in her note. They address some, though not all, of our concerns. Our clients have expressed their extreme unhappiness with the selection of two hospitals in Wales for this task, and our concerns and our clients' unhappiness will be repeated and amplified today.

Regrettably, there has been no shift in the Inquiry's position, as we've heard, and our clients feel heard but not listened to. We will consider carefully what we have heard today, but our clients do remain somewhat uncertain as to how this proposal is intended to actually work. From our understanding of this task, there are still a number of shortcomings in the proposal, which lead us to question its value.

The operation of and responses in Welsh hospitals are of course a key focus for Cymru bereaved families, and our clients are anxious that their concerns are properly aired and interrogated in this Inquiry, and this anxiety underlines our submissions on this point today.

Also I want to echo that in Module 1 Mr Keith King's Counsel created an expectation that the detail of preparedness on healthcare would be featured in this module, and it's very important to our clients that this is done with regard to Wales.

My Lady may recall that a significant proportion of the membership of this group lost their loved ones as a result of hospital-acquired Covid-19 or in the care home following discharge of hospital patients without testing.

The first point I'd like to make is on location, and it arises from the fact that in her note Ms Carey notes that the spotlight evidence is intended to cover both rural and urban areas, but in fact only hospitals from two areas of South Wales have been selected, and that's been commented on by others as well. Large swathes of Wales, the rest of South Wales, for example, North Wales and rural areas, are not covered by the selection made. While it may be reasonable not to actively seek information from the areas worst affected, in our submission it makes little sense, where evidence points to a particular problem in a particular area, to ignore that during this exercise or not to seek to build on it.

For example, the National Nosocomial COVID-19 Programme report was provided by the Welsh Government earlier this year for a period ending 31 January 2024. This showed that the highest rate of nosocomial infection was in North Wales, within Betsi Cadwaladr health board, and that the rates of nosocomial infection varied greatly across Wales. Hence our reference to the postcode lottery in Wales and Wales' particular geographical and demographic characteristics in our written submissions.

Failure to consider this variance in our submission not only limits the voice of those bereaved in other areas of Wales, but also leaves a gap in understanding of the UK-wide issues, which we now understand is what this evidence is directed at.

There are a number of relevant issues raised by our members which we have already brought to the Inquiry's attention, and these arise across the health boards, and examples are also at annex A of our written submissions, which have been provided for context.

We raised concerns with the Inquiry legal team in correspondence about the rates of nosocomial infection, healthcare facilities and access to healthcare facilities in North Wales as an example, based on the experiences of our clients, of an area where useful evidence may be sought. One of the stated aims of the spotlight process is to identify key themes and particular issues. We would question again whether two hospitals from South Wales can adequately identify the key themes and issues of the whole country, in which different regions had different demands placed on them.

So the point we make is that each health board faced unique challenges and responded differently to common challenges, so that key themes in Wales need broader scrutiny. Understanding the range of issues within Wales is surely critical and crucial to add to the Inquiry's understanding of UK-wide issues.

Looking at the rationale and criteria applied as set out in counsel's note, at paragraph 9 it's stated that:

"The purpose ... was to obtain evidence [of] the impact of national decision-making and leadership upon those operating within healthcare systems, including how hospitals responded 'on the ground' to the ... pandemic."

We agree, it's a laudable and proper aim, and we focus in particular on the words "on the ground", because we struggle to see how these aims are in fact satisfied by evidence from a Chief Medical Officer, a point that's already been made, but if I may, we also say that this will be inevitably at too high a level to be useful and, in our submission, will be unlikely to convey a true and vivid sense of what it was like to battle with the pandemic on a daily basis in the wards of the chosen hospitals, whether in Wales or elsewhere.

From the topic list in paragraph 13 of counsel's note, at (a), for example, on staff shortages, is it not relevant also to hear from staff on the ground how staff shortages impacted on their work within those hospitals? Would that not provide a more rounded picture of any problems? This will again, we submit, bring to life -- and this is important -- for the public, the Inquiry and CPs what it was actually like for the frontline staff at the chosen hospital, a crucial level of understanding, in our submission, for the crafting of meaningful recommendations.

At paragraph 9 counsel's note states that spotlight evidence is not the only way by which Module 3 will examine the impact of the pandemic on those working and being treated in hospitals. Whilst that was not elaborated on in the note, we did hear this morning that impact evidence requested from CPs and the accounts in the Every Story Matters process will be used in this regard.

The questions in our submission that still arise are: how will it fit with and make sense of the spotlight evidence? Will core participants be given an opportunity to respond to that evidence?

If the intention is to use expert evidence to fill any gaps, for example on analysing the rates of nosocomial infection across the UK, then we would make the following observations: experts are not able to cover the actual experiences of staff on the ground, and counsel has alerted us to a problem with the infection prevention and control expert evidence at paragraph 31 of her note, though of course we do note her submissions on that this morning.

So our concerns about gaps in evidence more generally about the Welsh experience are underlined by the expert draft intensive care evidence which has recently been circulated and the responses are formally due on 16 April. For now we can say that our view is that the draft report does not adequately deal with devolved issues and would be responding with details on this by the deadline set. That is a lacuna which raises for our clients the concern that the Welsh experience is not being sufficiently addressed in this module.

Further, on gaps in the evidence, we heard that other evidence on nosocomial infection rates, for example, is available from the Chief Medical Officer of Wales, Public Health Wales, and Welsh Government Health and Social Services Group. Again, and I'm sorry I'm being repetitive on this, our point is that this is high-level evidence and unlikely to throw light on the impact on the ground of decisions and leadership for healthcare workers interpreting guidelines from on high. On some issues, as noted in the draft intensive care report, guidance differed from area to area, leaving clinicians to decide how best to respond.

Lastly, we say that there is no indication as to whether or how evidence gathered by the spotlight process is to be tested. Is its reliability to be taken as read, or will CPs be given an opportunity to interrogate it, and if so on what basis? If it's not tested, we would question its value to the Inquiry, or even how useful or proportionate an exercise this actually is. This may be a particular concern to devolved nations. It's definitely a concern to the understanding of issues in Wales.

I do offer my apologies for sounding so disgruntled and negative about this process, but this is what our clients feel. It's a very important strand of the Inquiry and, without fully explained reassurances as to how else the key issues and themes will be elicited, the mantra that "the experience in Wales will be thoroughly examined" begins to sound somewhat hollow.

We do acknowledge the burdens on the Inquiry and we do raise concerns as to how this is a proportionate use of the Inquiry's resources in relation to Wales.

So we do ask once more that this is reviewed and that if statements from each of the seven health boards cannot be taken, then at least that one or two of the other health boards are considered from other parts of Wales and are included in this exercise, and also that consideration is given to including staff and clinicians from the chosen hospitals.

My third point was on delay in listing. Our experience in other modules is that disclosure has been late and sometimes comes after the event. It's not unusual. In Module 1, crucial evidence of risk registers was disclosed on 12 and 13 July last year, when the Welsh witnesses had already given evidence and we had no longer the opportunity to put these documents to those witnesses. Similar issues were encountered in Module 2B. We understand that delays are unavoidable but repeatedly CPs are having to play catch-up. It inevitably impacts on effective participation, and in particular where lay participants are concerned, who need more time to absorb what is disclosed even with legal advice.

With respect, we say it's not sufficient to say it's a knock-on effect of the late production of disclosure by other state bodies. It doesn't really help our clients. We are concerned that the balance between timing, resources, CP participation, could be struck better and that more time for hearings and also for Rule 10 questions is necessary.

We are anxious that there should be no delays in the timetabling, but added to the woes already referred to is the listing of hearings virtually back-to-back. In general written submissions are due one to two weeks before a hearing and three to four weeks after the conclusion of a hearing, so the overlap and demands on the work is clear, and especially where there is, say, six weeks between hearings. This is onerous and potentially impacts on the fairness for CPs and their ability to respond adequately.

I was going to make a fourth point on expert points, but I have already made the points I wanted to make on that.

So just on Rule 9 requests, we have heard what Counsel to the Inquiry has said and we've raised in our written submissions at paragraph 4 the requests that we have already made, which we have repeated in our written submissions.

So, with the greatest of respect and repeating the

understanding that time and resources are not

a bottomless pit, Cymru families feel that they must

record their disappointment and frustrations at this

point, but we do look forward to continuing to work and

collaborate with the Inquiry in the work of this module.

My Lady, thank you very much, and unless there's

anything further I can assist you with, those are my

submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: No, thank you.

Mr Straw.
