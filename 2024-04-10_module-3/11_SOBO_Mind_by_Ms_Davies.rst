11. Submissions on Behalf of Mind by Ms Davies
==============================================

**Ms Davies**: My name is Ms Davies, I'm head of legal at Mind, the mental health charity. I'm assisted today by Ms -- or Mrs Abdul Vincent Nightingale(?) and Ms Nimareng(?), part of the dedicated Mind legal team, and this gives me an opportunity to wish Eid Mubarak to my colleagues who are missing today.

It's probably not well known that Mind was set up by the post-war Labour government, who set up our NHS and modern welfare state and social services. They had recognised in their vision for the country that a separate voice was needed for those with mental health problems, who were even more sorely discriminated against and stigmatised than they are today.

Our mission was set then and remains today not to give up until those people with mental health problems are given the support and the respect that they need, and our submission is not set against the historic task of this Inquiry, which is to learn the lessons that can be learnt from the pandemic for the prevention of future suffering. Counsel Ms Carey has said that the Inquiry will look at key and significant issues. It's my job to persuade you that what happened to the nation's mental health during the pandemic and the impact on health services is both key and significant.

We appreciate that the Inquiry has to grapple with twin beasts, the scale of the information it has to review and the pace that must be adopted in order that recommendations will be practicable for future generations or indeed this generation, should another pandemic reach our shores.

We see the argument that was put at the last preliminary hearing that we cannot examine every condition during this Inquiry or look -- that was affected by the pandemic, and we cannot look in every nook and cranny. However, mental health problems are not every condition. They're a condition that everyone can get. In normal times, however we seek to define that now, one in four people will seek help for their mental health in any given year.

During the pandemic, the scale of those mental health problems became gargantuan. Substantial parts of those mental health problems were, we say, predictable. We knew that SARS-1 carried post-viral depression syndrome, and it was reasonable to assume until told otherwise that SARS-2 would do the same. The impact of lockdown and shielding was bound to be detrimental for a significant portion of the population shut off from their social contact and their social support. We saw mass bereavements, often without the chance to say goodbye, and that created an obvious need.

Our health service staff were under intolerable stress, and were facing both death and Covid with inadequate PPE. The shutting of schools was bound to affect both parents and children alike, although perhaps the intensity of that was less predicted, according to the parents that I know, and yet there appeared not to be a public health mental health plan to address what we say were these population health predictable issues. And why is that?

You know, I could say -- I could give you a general opinion about the stigma and the status of those with mental health problems, but surely the answer is more nuanced than that, and I say a perfectly proper question for this Inquiry to address.

On top of those predictable problems, there were less expected issues. Many people with no prior mental health problems experienced first and very serious episodes of psychosis and found that their lives -- actually particularly those who were intubated in ICU, for some reason, and those people found that their lives unravelled as a result of those illnesses. 8 million people sought and were turned away from mental health services because they were deemed not to be sick enough. Recent evidence showed that one in nine children who -- are still carrying a mental health disability that started during the pandemic. Recently figures were released that said that people in their 20s were off sick from work more than people in their 40s. The response from the government was not to learn some of the lessons that might have been -- to intervene in that issue, but that mental health culture had gone too far.

We at Mind would say there's no such thing as mental health culture, there are only people and their families who are suffering.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm sorry to interrupt, Ms Davies, but we do have limited time. Could we go back to the issues I have to decide today in the preliminary hearing, please.

**Ms Davies**: Yes.

There was -- also perhaps less predictable were questions such as lack of PPE. That meant that there was rationing and prioritisation. Mental health in-patient and community services were not priorities for PPE, and that had an impact. This meant that during the first few weeks of lockdown, when a quarter of mental health in-patients were discharged early, community services, who were also not a priority, found themselves with what they say were both confusing guidance and inadequate or no PPE. This meant that the people who were meant to look after the discharged patients were simply not there or not knowing what to do.

Psychiatric nurses are less trained in infection control, and that and the lack of PPE led to some really dreadful experiences for those that were left in hospitals. So, for example, we have had stories of people who lost all of their leave, even though they had previously many hours a day, and people who were locked in their rooms for up to five days at a time, in isolation, and who were denied access to basic things like showers.

Could this have been handled better? Is there something we could do different? These, we say, are perfectly proper questions that this Inquiry could answer.

In terms of staff mental health, I know from my own experience at the Nightingale hospital that they developed a programme of putting on your psychological PPE. Counsellors were available at all shifts. This wasn't rolled out across the NHS. I don't know why. And again, we say this is something the Inquiry can look at.

In terms of when mental health might be looked at, we were told that if not here then maybe we'd look in Module 6. There was nothing in Module 6 about mental health, and we say that Module 3 is the best place to look at these issues. Or the Inquiry I suppose could have a separate module, but that's not for me to tell you to do, it's just a suggestion. Or the Inquiry could move some of the children's mental health into looking at children in schools, because the schools are such an integral part of the mental health referral system.

And let me make clear, Baroness Hallett, I'm not disgruntled, I am hopeful. This is one of the most important events that we have taken part in. We want the Covid Inquiry to succeed. We want its legacy to be that of a forward-looking Inquiry that breaks with the tired tradition of excluding those of us with mental health problems because it's often easier to do so. Unless I can assist you further, that's the end of my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much. Thank you for your help.

I think we can take one more before we break, unless I'm told ... yes, Ms Morris.
