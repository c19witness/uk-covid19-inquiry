Transcript of Module 3 Preliminary Hearing, on 10 April 2024

*(10.29 am)*

**Lady Hallett**: We'll wait until on the dot of 10.30.

*(Pause)*

**Lady Hallett**: It may not be on the dot, but good morning, everybody.

This is the third preliminary hearing into Module 3, an investigation of the impact on the healthcare systems during the pandemic, and we have a huge amount to get through, so I shall say no more and ask Ms Jacqueline Carey King's Counsel, who is Lead Counsel to the Inquiry for this module as well as for the care module, to outline the issues that I have to consider today.

Ms Carey.

**Ms Carey**: Thank you, my Lady. Statement by LEAD COUNSEL TO THE INQUIRY for MODULE 3

**Ms Carey**: As you have just made clear, this is the third preliminary hearing in Module 3, and of the 36 core participants in this module, 20 I think are present in the room today at Dorland House and a number of others are attending online.

I know that in advance of today's hearing you've received written submissions from a number of core participants, many of whom I know wish to expand upon but not repeat those submissions orally today.

It is not practical or necessary for me to respond to all of the matters raised, but as we go through the agenda there are various aspects that I will seek to address from Counsel to the Inquiry's perspective.

I think the agenda has been put up on the screens at Dorland House. There are updates in relation to Rule 9s, expert witnesses, disclosure, Every Story Matters, and the timetable for the public hearings in due course.

So may I turn, please, to an update in relation to Rule 9 requests.

As at the start of this month, Module 3 has sent over 190 Rule 9 requests to individuals, organisations and government bodies across the UK, and we have received back 91 signed statements, of which 69 have been disclosed.

The Module 3 solicitor team monthly update note provides details of the recipients of those requests and indeed an overview of the topics which they have been asked about. Recent Rule 9 requests have been sent to the respective health ministers and cabinet secretaries during the relevant period, namely Matt Hancock and Sajid Javid, Robin Swann, Jeane Freeman, Humza Yousaf, Vaughan Gething and Eluned Morgan.

For the avoidance of confusion, it may be helpful for me to clarify that, contrary to the submissions of some of the core participants, these were not late requests but were as a result of a deliberate decision by the Inquiry legal team to await the receipt of the bulk of the corporate statements, some of which have been delayed, and I'll come back to that in a moment, and for some of the witnesses to have been -- given evidence in Modules 2, 2A and 2B.

As you might imagine, my Lady, the Module 3 team has been keen to ensure that all relevant information and evidence was taken into account when drafting focused Rule 9 requests for those individuals, and accordingly, in our submission, it would have been premature and inefficient for those Rule 9s to have been issued sooner.

The deadlines for those Rule 9 statements are mid to late May of this year, so four months before the start of the hearing, and if there are any requests for extensions from those individuals, then those applications will be scrutinised to ensure that their timely onward disclosure to the core participants is not hampered.

Over the course of the Rule 9 process the Inquiry has provided recipients of Rule 9 requests with a deadline by which the draft statements should be submitted. Now, some recipients have asked the Inquiry for an extension by which to file their response and, in appropriate cases, reasonable extensions have been granted. However, since the last preliminary hearing, your Ladyship has considered it necessary to issue what are called section 21 Inquiries Act notices to a number of government department/agencies, to ensure that all matters raised in the Rule 9 requests are properly addressed and that the evidence is provided in time to allow the Inquiry legal team to progress its work.

By way of background, the department and agencies in question received their Rule 9 requests in the spring of 2023, they were issued between March and May of last year, and applications for extensions for deadlines were often granted. However, the Inquiry became increasingly concerned to hear that some delays in receiving evidence was said to have been a result of the work required on other modules, whether preparing statements or preparing for public hearings, even in circumstances when many months had elapsed between the Rule 9 requests being issued by Module 3 and the draft statement or parts thereof being received.

In deciding to issue section 21 notices you were cognisant not only of the demands placed on those departments by other Inquiry modules, and indeed by other public inquiries, but also of the everyday pressures of the respective department's normal work, particularly over the winter, and I know that you took this into account when setting and, where necessary, varying section 21 deadlines.

Those section 21 notices have been issued to four government bodies and departments: UKHSA, Department of Health and Social Care, the Welsh Government Health and Social Services Group, and the Department of Health Northern Ireland.

All deadlines have been met. In some instances the statements provided do not adequately address all matters set out in the Rule 9 request or indeed in the section 21 notice. That has been the case with a question to the Welsh Chief Medical Officer, some questions in one part of the Department of Health's response, some questions in the revised draft corporate statement by the Welsh Government, and some questions in the Department of Health Northern Ireland corporate statement. So consequently, further Rule 9 requests and/or varied section 21 notices have been issued with a short deadline for a response to ensure that all topics are fully answered.

In addition to the Rule 9 requests sent by the Module 3 team, the Inquiry is grateful for the suggestions made by core participants as to which additional individuals or bodies should receive a Rule 9 request and/or be sent a supplemental Rule 9 request. These suggestions are actively being considered in particular to ensure that any further requests are proportionate and sufficiently focused on assisting the Inquiry with any future recommendations your Ladyship may make. Where the module already has a body of evidence covering a particular topic or the request does not fall within a key area that is within scope, it is unlikely the Inquiry will consider it necessary to issue a Rule 9 request or a supplemental Rule 9.

Now, my Lady, within the Rule 9 requests there are a number of discrete topics to which I'd like to return. The first is what is known as the "spotlight hospitals". As you may appreciate, one of the challenges for a module of this size is to obtain evidence about the impact of national decision-making upon those operating within the healthcare system, including how hospitals responded, if I can put it like this, "on the ground" to the Covid pandemic; and so in this regard, in December of last year Module 3 sent Rule 9 requests to 22 hospitals across the length and breadth of the UK. The requests focused on examples of the steps taken to respond, how the hospitals responded to the challenges faced, and we sought practical examples of their response.

The focus of the requests was therefore very much from the perspectives of the people working in the hospitals rather than from the perspectives of the patients or their families.

Now, my Lady, whether the use of the phrase "spotlight hospitals" is the correct terminology to describe the evidence-gathering exercise perhaps might be debatable, but the aim of this work is to gather evidence from the hospitals themselves as to how the pandemic affected them and the staff working in them.

While a number of core participants have welcomed the Inquiry's approach to the spotlight evidence, others have expressed concerns about the number of hospitals involved or the methodology behind the selection of the hospitals, and so it might assist this morning if I set out a little more detail about those matters.

The purpose of the spotlights is not to identify hospitals most severely affected by the pandemic, nor is it to conduct an examination nation by nation, region by region, or hospital by hospital. It is not a comparative exercise comparing one hospital's response against another, nor could it be. As was made clear in the update note sent out in January but covering the December work, and in accordance with the Inquiry's terms of reference, it is not the Inquiry's intention to examine or compare the circumstances surrounding the treatment of individual patients or the outcomes of their treatment. The intention of requesting the information from the spotlight hospitals is to assist my Lady in identifying recurring themes and particular issues that arose with respect to the healthcare system's response.

The themes that will emerge inevitably will not be considered as an exhaustive list nor necessarily representative of the experiences in each and every hospital across the UK, but as the evidence comes in it will come to form part of the Inquiry's broader investigation into the operational and healthcare pressures or challenges faced by the healthcare systems across the UK during the relevant period.

The number and location of the spotlight hospitals were chosen so as to gain evidence from across the four nations, taking into account matters including respective populations within each nation, covering some rural and urban areas. And accordingly, two spotlight hospitals were selected from each of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, with the remaining 16 spotlights being selected from England. The number of spotlights is inevitably limited, given that this exercise is but one aspect of Module 3's work and the need to be proportionate, not just within Module 3 but across the Inquiry's work as a whole. In our submission, this would be consistent with your Ladyship's obligations under section 17 of the Inquiries Act, to act with fairness and with regard to the need to avoid unnecessary cost, whether to the public or to the witnesses.

The Inquiry has been asked to send spotlight Rule 9 requests to a hospital in each of the seven healthcare boards in Wales, and the five health and social care trusts in Northern Ireland. I note that were the Inquiry to adopt that approach across the entire UK, it would result in spotlight requests being sent to hospitals in each of the 14 territorial NHS boards in Scotland, and potentially to nearly 230 NHS trusts in England, so a total of 250 hospitals across the UK, in our submission a course of action that would be disproportionate and contrary to your commitment to run this Inquiry efficiently.

My Lady, as you will have appreciated from the written submissions, the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru raised specific concerns amongst their members about nosocomial infection rates, or hospital-acquired infection, in Wales. They submit that in the absence of a separate Welsh Covid-19 public inquiry, Module 3 should spotlight a hospital in each of the seven boards in order to obtain an accurate and/or reflective picture of what happened in Welsh hospitals.

My Lady, in my submission, this request misunderstands the aim behind this part of the Inquiry's work, which is to provide a UK-wide perspective on recurring themes regarding the healthcare systems, and importantly it is not to investigate particular issues in Wales. The request that this Inquiry reflect sufficiently and broadly the dominant and distinct issues which arose in Wales risks, in our submission, falling into the kind of comparative exercise that is not appropriate.

In relation to hospital-acquired infection rates in Wales, Module 3 has already obtained a large amount of evidence on this issue, including in the statements and exhibits provided by the Welsh CMO, Frank Atherton, Public Health Wales, and the Welsh Government Health and Social Services Group.

Now, my Lady, one of those statements was disclosed in a tranche of disclosure made yesterday. Two of the statements are due for disclosure in the coming tranches to be made, but those statements taken as a whole help to establish how hospital-acquired transmission was identified, understood and addressed in Wales throughout the relevant period.

Now, clearly I appreciate, given that much of this disclosure is to come, it's understandable that the core participants are yet unaware of the evidence that is available and the totality of that evidence. But in addition, the infection prevention and control experts are being asked to summarise and critically analyse official estimates of hospital-acquired infection, in all four nations, as well as the alternative estimates published in the scientific literature.

When selecting the spotlight hospitals, the Inquiry considered a number of different factors, including the questionnaire responses provided by some trusts, health boards and health and social care trusts, and identifying from those responses hospitals which may be able to provide practical information and evidence to the Inquiry.

Module 3 also selected some hospitals where the trust or board did not provide a response to the Inquiry's questionnaire, and we also sought out publicly available information about particular issues arising in hospitals, and the Rule 9 requests were sent to the medical or clinical director or chief medical officer or equivalent at each of the 22 hospitals across the UK.

The requests specifically asked that the statement be provided by an appropriate individual or individuals who were able to provide evidence about events during the relevant period rather than a corporate statement from the senior management team at the trust or the board responsible for that hospital.

The requests themselves sent to each hospital covered the same topic areas and questions. In addition, the Inquiry asked some hospitals about specific issues that were raised either in the questionnaire responses or were revealed in open source research on the hospital in question where those issues might have indicated systemic problems in response to Covid-19.

All 22 hospitals have now responded. The draft statements have had feedback provided on them, and they are now in the process of being finalised ready for disclosure. Initial analysis of the statements suggest that some common themes are emerging, and, my Lady, this is just a small snapshot of some of the evidence, but there are themes emerging such as staff shortages prior to the pandemic and/or shortages -- to workers isolating and becoming ill during the pandemic.

A number have raised relaxation in nursing fixed ratios of care. Other responses reveal the numbers of workers suffering from Long Covid and the varying methods of support offered by hospitals for staff with Long Covid. Issued raised include practical problems with the physical condition of the estate, particularly in older hospital buildings, which presented challenges implementing IPC guidance, for example narrow corridors or :outline:`poor ventilation`.

There is evidence in those statements about variations in approaches to visiting restrictions. Also evidence, particularly from the English spotlights, about the impact of vaccination as a condition of deployment, or VCOD as it's known, not just in terms of ascertaining numbers of workers who were or weren't vaccinated, but also often the damaging effect of the proposal on staff relations and morale. A number of the spotlights speak of the impact on workers from ethnic minority backgrounds.

There were some innovative practices adopted by some of the hospitals. May I just give you one or two examples. There were booking systems for visitors, family liaison officers to aid virtual communications, there were virtual follow-up of antenatal and postnatal Covid-positive women.

There were examples of the lengths to which some of those working in hospitals went to provide care. Just one example, in Altnagelvin in Northern Ireland workers placed little wooden hearts in the pockets of patients who were approaching death as a small connection to their loved ones that could not be with them in hospital. There are some painful accounts of the impact on staff working in hospital, for example in Manchester Royal Infirmary, one of the elderly wards in wave 2 experienced seven patient deaths within 24 hours, whereas outside of the pandemic it was death every one to two weeks.

As I say, they are but just some examples of the evidence obtained by the spotlight hospitals. The hospitals were not asked about any plans they had in place for dealing with the pandemic, this evidence being more appropriately obtained from the respective Department of Healths, but, that said, a number of the spotlights provided evidence of the plans they put in place as the pandemic took hold. And in our submission the totality of this evidence, combined with the Rule 9s sent to the government departments, means it's not necessary to instruct an expert to consider the question of preparedness separately to the consideration of preparedness in the existing reports that the Inquiry already has.

My Lady, some core participants have expressed a concern that the signatory to the spotlight statement might provide a rose-tinted view or that the statement has been written from an unduly corporate perspective. In fact, having reviewed a number of the draft statements myself, overall we do not consider this concern has materialised, and in fact there is now a body of evidence attesting to how the pandemic affected the hospitals and their staff, including those working on the frontline.

My Lady, three of the core participants have submitted that spotlights should be extended to include other services, for example primary care, pharmacies and ambulances. Module 3 has considered this suggestion carefully but considers that the evidence received from the relevant royal colleges, ambulance trusts and other associations and bodies, properly and proportionately examines issues affecting these parts of the healthcare system.

May I turn to a different aspect of the Rule 9 work that is going on, and deal with some research that has recently been commissioned, because, in addition to the spotlights, the Inquiry has commissioned a research survey on escalation of care decisions made by frontline healthcare workers, and the primary issue being considered is how frontline clinicians made decisions about escalation of care during the extreme circumstances of the pandemic, and whether thresholds for escalating a patient's care were altered based on resource availability rather than clinical need. That includes decisions about the assessment of patients in the community and escalating them to hospital and then, once in hospital, escalation to critical care.

The project aims to hear from a wide range of healthcare professionals involved in decisions about escalation of care, including paramedics, 111 call handlers, clinical advisers, GPs, A&E doctors and doctors based on general wards and doctors and nurses based on critical wards. The Inquiry has commissioned IFF Research to conduct this project. IFF Research is a company with significant experience and technical expertise in running large-scale surveys of healthcare professionals, and further information on the project will be provided in the monthly update notes in due course.

The final matter I wish to raise in relation to the Rule 9 update is in relation to impact evidence. Module 3's scope makes clear that it will examine the impact of the pandemic on people's experiences of healthcare during the pandemic, including through illustrative accounts, and so in addition, therefore, to the accounts given by those individuals who have contributed to the Inquiry's listening exercise, Every Story Matters, Module 3 has invited 21 of the core participant groups in Module 3 from across the UK to provide short summary accounts from a specified number of individual members of those groups or individuals supported by those groups during the relevant period about their experience of the healthcare system.

The core participant groups include all of the bereaved family groups, charities, other groups such as the clinically vulnerable, those with Long Covid, professional membership organisations, and it's hoped that in this way a range of experiences during the pandemic will be captured.

The summaries are designed to help the Inquiry identify those witnesses who may be able to speak to systemic issues, including, for example, individuals working on the frontline, such as healthcare workers, cleaners, porters, ambulance staff, paramedics, pharmacists, doctors and nurses. And they will be able to speak to concerns about, for example, PPE and about the sheer physical, mental and emotional toll that the pandemic took.

A small number of these witnesses will be formally asked to provide statements and some of those will be asked to give oral evidence at the public hearing. That will be in addition to other evidence about the impact of the pandemic on individuals, as set out in some of the other statements the Inquiry has received, as well as in Every Story Matters.

My Lady, the Inquiry legal team has started to review the summaries with a view to identifying those individuals who may receive a Rule 9 request. Where a witness is not called to give evidence, we anticipate inviting you to adduce that written statement into evidence by publishing it on the Inquiry website.

It follows from what I have said that, in addition to Every Story Matters, some impact evidence will be called at the public hearing and some statements are likely to be published, but I know that a number of the core participants urge the Inquiry to hear from a larger selection of impact witnesses. My Lady, in our submission, it's not about calling any set or specific number of witnesses but rather about ensuring you hear from a range of individuals who are best placed to convey the impact of the pandemic based on their respective experiences.

My Lady, that's all I wish to say about the Rule 9 update. May I just deviate slightly from the agenda and actually deal with expert witnesses now before going on to disclosure, which might in fact make more sense in relation to a number of the submissions that you are to receive this morning.

The Inquiry has identified eight areas for expert evidence and seven of the reports are progressing well and are on track. I know that some core participants have repeated their request to have sight of the letters of instruction. This remains an unnecessary step, in our submission. Sight of the draft report and the option to comment on the draft report provides ample opportunity for core participants to contribute to the final expert report. I can confirm that the expert reports are all addressing matters affecting the UK and not just looking at the position in the country in which the expert is based.

The first of those reports is a report in relation to Long Covid, and the report of Professor Chris Brightling and Dr Rachael Evans was disclosed yesterday in the tranche of disclosure made. They also, I think you'll recall, prepared a report for Module 2, and that has been disclosed to the Module 3 core participants. Whilst addressing you on the topic of Long Covid, some core participants repeat their request for Module 3 to look at whether Long Covid should be designated as a disability or an occupational disease, and for you to look at the financial support for those diagnosed with Long Covid. My Lady, I know, will not be assisted by repetition, and you have already ruled that this is not a matter falling within the scope of Module 3, so unless any new information is brought to your attention in the course of this preliminary hearing, I would invite you to confirm your earlier ruling.

The second report that has been commissioned is in relation to intensive care. The draft report by Dr Ganesh Suntharalingam and Professor Charlotte Summers has been sent to core participants and I know that they will be working on that and their comments are due by 16 April.

Four non-Covid conditions are being looked at within the scope of Module 3: ischaemic heart disease, colorectal cancer, hip replacements, and in-patient children and young people's mental health services. There are expert reports on all four conditions that have been commissioned. All four reports will examine from a healthcare systems perspective the impact of the pandemic on diagnosis, care and treatment of the respective non-Covid conditions, and the reports are looking at how diagnostic and treatment pathways were maintained during the pandemic, and the outcome of delays to diagnosis and/or care and treatment on patient outcomes.

So taking each in turn, in relation to ischaemic heart disease, Professor Christopher Gale, who is a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Leeds, and his colleague, Dr Ramesh Nadarajah, who is a cardiology speciality registrar, have prepared a draft report and that was shared with core participants earlier this week.

The reports in relation to elective hip replacement surgery and on in-patient children and young people's mental health services, the drafts are due to be received by the Inquiry in May. And in relation to colorectal cancer, Professor Aneel Bhangu and his colleague, Dr Dmitri Nepogodiev, who are based in the University of Birmingham, have been instructed in relation to colorectal cancer, and their draft report is likely to be sent to core participants for their comments in May.

There is an expert report commissioned in relation to primary care and emergency pre-hospital care. Professor Helen Snooks, who is a professor of health services research at Swansea University, and Professor Adrian Edwards, who is a professor of general practice at Cardiff University, have been instructed to provide a draft report examining a number of aspects of healthcare outside of hospitals, and their report will comment on changes to primary care, the way in which it was accessed, including the transition to remote primary care, such as the use of either telephone triage or video calls, oximetry at home, other remote monitoring. They are going to look at emergency pre-hospital care, including changes to 999 and 111 calls, and impact on ambulance services, including response time by category, handover time, outcome, whether related to likely Covid-19 or not. They are going to look at the escalation from community care to hospital care.

They are also going to look at the shielding programme, including how the shielding criteria evolved over time, a summary of relevant published academic research on some of the positive and negative impacts of the shielding programme, and an evaluation of any known qualitative or quantitative differences between England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in the outcomes of the shielding programme, if that is available.

It is not the Inquiry's present intention to ask the experts to provide their opinion on the impact of Covid-19 on children's experiences of the healthcare system, including clinically vulnerable and clinically extremely vulnerable children.

Now, that draft report is likely to be sent to core participants in May. I know that the John's Campaign core participant group submits that this report should cover healthcare provision in people's homes, care settings, mental health units and other community settings. My Lady, as you are aware, access to healthcare in some care settings is a matter being examined in Module 6. Moreover, as you already made clear in your ruling following the second preliminary hearing in this module, the other settings are not referred to within the scope of Module 3, and in the November monthly update note you confirmed that the impact on mental health services would not be examined in Module 3.

In light of those matters, the Inquiry does not intend to expand the areas that this expert report will cover. May I make it clear, however, that the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers is a matter about which evidence has been and is being gathered, and I hope that that allays any misunderstanding on the part of some core participants that this module is not looking at the harm caused to the mental health of those working in the healthcare sector.

Finally, the final report that is being commissioned by the Inquiry is that in relation to infection prevention and control (IPC).

My Lady, in my note to the core participants last month, I explained that progress in relation to the expert report on IPC is not as Module 3 anticipated or would have wished. In short, of the original five experts identified in September 2023, only two are now available to continue with this work. Those two are Clive Beggs and Hajo Grundmann. Clive Beggs' draft report will shortly be ready to be disclosed to core participants. That report focuses on the mechanism of transmission of Covid-19, the role of :outline:`ventilation and air cleaning systems` in hospitals, and the role of :outline:`respiratory protective equipment` (:outline:`RPE`) in mitigating the transmission of Covid-19.

Although the Inquiry had initially envisaged producing an overarching IPC report to which all IPC experts contributed, rather than delay the provision of feedback on this report, the Inquiry intends to ask core participants to comment on Professor Beggs' draft report so that this aspect of IPC expert evidence can be progressed.

In relation to the other aspects of IPC, and in particular to changing clinical guidelines, testing and other IPC interventions and experiences on the frontline, the Inquiry has devoted considerable time to identify suitable replacements.

Dr Gee Yen Shin, a consultant virologist and director of IPC at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Professor Dinah Gould, an independent IPC consultant and an honorary professor of nursing at City University London, and Dr Ben Warne, an academic clinical lecturer and speciality registrar in infectious disease and general internal medicine, have all now confirmed that they are willing and able to write a report covering the remaining IPC issues within scope, and so I anticipate and very much hope that the IPC expert report is now very much back on track.

A number of core participants invite you to consider other areas for expert evidence. The Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK and the Northern Irish Covid Bereaved Families for Justice submit that Module 3 needs to obtain further evidence about the disproportionate outcomes on black and minority ethnic healthcare workers and discrimination, whether that's on the basis of age, sex, gender, disability, and on people suffering different types of mental health conditions.

They suggest that the experts in previous modules who considered these matters should produce, where necessary, Module 3 specific addenda. In our submission, this is not necessary. Those reports provide you with the necessary context and background to a number of different disproportionate impacts, and those reports will therefore complement the statements and evidence obtained by Module 3 which examine disproportionate impacts, including, to name just one statement, in the statement from the NHS Race and Health Observatory.

The John's Campaign core participant group ask that Module 3 obtains expert evidence on the use and, it is said, misuse of DNACPR notices. My Lady, a large number of the Rule 9 requests sent by Module 3 have asked about the use of DNACPR notices, so we do not consider it is necessary to instruct an expert on this topic.

I think, as I may have said at an earlier preliminary hearing, it would not be possible to instruct experts on every area within the scope of Module 3, or indeed on every impact felt and suffered, and so the John's Campaign group also requests that Module 3 obtain expert evidence on how those with learning disabilities accessed healthcare services and the impact on the learning disabled and those with cognitive impairments, and my Lady, that is, in our submission, one of those areas where the module simply cannot accede to every request, no matter how important the topic is for those people who suffer with those disabilities.

Three of the core participants have submitted that an expert should be appointed to comment on the use of private sector contracting and outsourcing during the pandemic. Module 3 has requested and/or already received evidence relating to the use of private hospitals during the pandemic. And I emphasise the phrase "use of private hospitals" as that is the phrase that appears within Module 3's scope. Accordingly, the Inquiry legal team does not consider that the expert evidence is required on this topic.

My Lady, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society submit that an expert should be appointed who has expertise in pharmacists and pharmacy to consider matters including the impact of IPC guidance on pharmacy teams and the adequate provision of PPE to pharmacists. Module 3 has sought evidence on these and other topics from a number of witnesses and so it does not consider that an expert in addition to that evidence is necessary.

Turning to, my Lady, the next matter on the agenda, and that is disclosure.

In addition to the 12 tranches of disclosure already made by Module 3, there are over 80 draft statements that are either being reviewed and feedback prepared or where the Inquiry has given feedback and requested that the statements be finalised.

Recent tranches of disclosure in March and April this year contain a significant proportion of corporate witness evidence from organisations and departments such as NHS England, DHSC, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer, UKHSA, the Health and Safety Executive, Public Health Scotland and NHS services, Scotland. Those statements are lengthy and detailed and cover a wide range of topics relevant to Module 3's scope.

In addition, there have been and there will be disclosure of statements of some of Module 3's core participant groups, which highlight specific areas of concerns relevant to their members. It's inevitable that reading and assimilating all that material will take some time, and therefore the Inquiry legal team considers that, in order to have a more meaningful and detailed second draft of the list of issues, the second draft of the list of issues should be circulated once the disclosed material has been analysed.

The Inquiry currently holds 14,000 documents, totalling around 157,000 pages which will be disclosed on Module 3 in due course. I see my Lady's eyes raised.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm just thinking, not much for me to do then.

**Ms Carey**: That doesn't include the statements and associated exhibits which are not yet signed or provided to the Inquiry.

Now, I provide those figures so that core participants know the scale of disclosure that will be forthcoming, and I hope that it will assist them in their resourcing arrangements for reviewing those documents. It's not meant to scare, but to try to assist with what is coming in the next few months.

A number of core participants have requested that disclosure or the majority thereof is completed by the end of June of this year. Now, the Inquiry is working hard to review and disclose material in Module 3, but it must be acknowledged that much of the disclosure work is still going on Module 2C, which I think starts at the end of this month, and goes into May, and so consequently some of the Inquiry's resources are diverted to that module, and indeed to later modules which have public hearings in 2025.

The Inquiry's resources, like those of material providers, are not unlimited and difficult decisions must be made. But may I make it plain, Module 3 is equally keen to complete the better part of disclosure by the end of June or early July, and that ambition may be all the more achievable as the Inquiry is currently prioritising the disclosure of the statements and exhibits provided to Module 3 directly, as this is of particular relevance. The Inquiry recognises that the quantities of material being disclosed each week must increase significantly from the current rate and so we will be increasing the amount of paralegal resource available to Module 3 and anticipate that that will double the current rate at which disclosure is being made.

There are also a number of ways in which core participants and material providers can assist the Inquiry to speed up the rate of current disclosure. A number of material providers are seeking significant extensions of time in which to review provision or redactions to material beyond the standard three working days, including extensions of up to two weeks. Going forward, Module 3 is unlikely to be able to grant any significant extensions; as I have said, we need to double the quantities of material being disclosed each week, and material providers may wish to bear this in mind when deciding who will review the material for redactions and how to seek instructions from clients who may be on leave.

Some core participant material providers are still engaging in protracted and evolving correspondence about the redaction of senior officials' names. To give one example, UKHSA has recently changed the list of individuals it considers to be senior officials, which is causing ongoing redaction issues. It's also asked Module 3 to redact the names of people from other government departments, such as Clara Swinson, who is a director general at DHSC, Graham Medley, a member of SAGE, and Ruth May, who is the Chief Nursing Officer in England.

The Inquiry's established position is that it will only redact the names and email addresses of those whom it considers to be junior officials, and in our submission those three individuals, for example, are clearly not junior.

Engaging in correspondence about these matters at the material provider review stage of course takes time for the Inquiry's legal team to respond to and resolve, all of which diverts resources from the actual review, redaction and disclosure task. Material providers are therefore urged to assist the Inquiry in this important task where they can and respond as swiftly as possible to queries and not repeatedly raise the same issue where the Inquiry has made its position clear, not change the names they asked to redact, and not to seek redactions on publicly available material.

So, taking that as a whole, with a renewed ambition from the Inquiry's perspective and the co-operation, I know, from the core participant material providers and other material providers, it is hoped that we will be in a position to complete the bulk of that disclosure by the end of June or early July.

In addition, Module 3 has reviewed the transcripts of evidence from Modules 1 and 2, and the relevant transcripts and statements will be disclosed in a separate discrete tranche of disclosure. Work is ongoing reviewing the transcripts of evidence from Modules 2A and B. That has commenced, and 2C module will be reviewed in due course.

My Lady, the penultimate matter on the agenda is Every Story Matters.

Over 11,000 experiences of healthcare services during the pandemic have been shared with Every Story Matters via the online web form, with many more sharing their experiences of having had Covid-19, bereavement and Long Covid. The Inquiry has heard from people around the UK directly as part of Every Story Matters events programmes, including members of the public, bereaved families, Long Covid survivors and healthcare staff.

In addition, 450 individuals have participated in the research interviews for Every Story Matters, including 212 patients and 238 healthcare workers and other professionals in healthcare roles.

All those experiences are being analysed and brought together in the first Every Story Matters report for the Inquiry, and that report is due to be provided to the Inquiry in the middle of this month, following which it will be reviewed by the Inquiry legal team, feedback provided, and it will be finalised and formatted. Those matters take a little time and we anticipate that the report will be shared with the core participants by the end of June.

Finally, my Lady, the public hearings.

Module 3 public hearings will commence on 9 September this year and take place in two phases, each lasting five weeks. The Inquiry is not planning to hold hearings in the weeks of 14 and 21 October, and so the second phase will begin on 28 October. Requests have been made to move the two-week break, but I understand that this cannot be accommodated. The Inquiry does not currently anticipate holding a further preliminary hearing for Module 3 before the start of the public hearings in September. However, I know that the Inquiry will keep this under review and will inform all core participants if it considers a further preliminary hearing to be necessary.

A number of the core participants submit that a ten-week hearing time is insufficient to examine the matters within Module 3 and have asked that additional hearing time be allocated. My Lady, you have already allocated ten weeks of hearing time to Module 3, making this the longest public hearing to date, but even so you may think that it is simply not possible to include more than is already envisaged.

Moreover, you have been clear that the Inquiry will not run on and on and that you want to hear evidence and make recommendations in a timely manner. Given the Inquiry's programme of work, including, for example, preparation for hearings in 2025 and the publication of reports, it will not be possible to extend the hearing time, nor will it be possible to move the two-week break.

The Inquiry legal team notes that a number of written submissions have repeated core participants' offers to assist the Inquiry in its work, and we will hope this will be extended to being focused on those matters that require examination and exploration in the public hearing, knowing that your Ladyship will have considered in full the written statements and evidence contained therein.

So in preparation for the public hearings, as I've already alluded to, the second draft of the list of issues we hope to circulate by the end of May, along with a provisional list of witnesses, and we will invite the core participants' submissions on those documents in due course.

The monthly update notes will provide detail about the process for evidence proposals to be sent to core participants, and the precise pre-Rule 10 procedure to be adopted by Module 3, but at the outset I must observe, with 36 separate core participant groups and organisations, suggestions for pre-Rule 10 questions need to be proportionate and focused. Not every question or point can be raised or needs to be put to every witness, and core participants are asked to reflect carefully on this before making any pre-Rule 10 applications in Module 3.

Module 3 will adopt the process used in earlier modules and accordingly ask that pre-Rule 10 requests are limited to key and significant matters, and to matters that the core participants does not anticipate CTI will cover. It assists no one and it's not conducive to an efficient process for the Inquiry legal teams, nor indeed for the core participant legal teams, for pre-Rule 10 applications to be made in respect of questions that Counsel to the Inquiry are obviously going to ask.

Moreover, the Inquiry legal team considers that the contents of any pre-Rule 10 applications may be better focused on questions in areas that might lead you to making meaningful recommendations for the future.

My Lady, I make those observations knowing that all core participants have repeatedly assured your Ladyship of their desire and willingness to assist the Inquiry in its work, and we hope that that renewed focus will help the public hearings run smoothly and efficiently and ensure that core participants' particular interests in a witness or a topic are advanced either by Counsel to the Inquiry's questions or by the core participants' questions themselves.

Further guidance on the evidence proposals and the pre-Rule 10 process will be provided in the monthly update notes in due course.

My Lady, that's all I propose to say by way of Counsel to the Inquiry's submissions to your Ladyship. Can I invite you, please, to publish the written submissions on the website later today, and I think the first core participant to address you is Mr Weatherby King's Counsel.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Submissions will be published.

**Ms Carey**: Thank you very much, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Weatherby.

1. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Weatherby KC
=====================================================================================

**Mr Weatherby**: Good morning, my Lady. As you know, I appear for Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK.

As we hope we have done consistently so far, our submissions are made in the spirit of assisting the Inquiry in fulfilling its terms of reference.

Can I say at the outset that we have looked carefully at the submissions of other, particularly the non-state, core participants, and we support many perhaps most of the points so clearly made by them and I'll try not to overlap too much, treading on their lawns.

In particular, we support the submissions of Mind, urging the Inquiry to include adult mental health within Module 3. Our submissions, which I will say a little bit more about in due course, resonate with FEMHO and others regarding the need for further discrimination evidence. And we specifically endorse submissions made about the issue of the downgrading of Covid as an HCID, high-consequence infectious disease, in March 2020, made by, I think, the BMA and the :outline:`Covid-19 Airborne Transmission Alliance`, and no doubt you will recall this is an issue that we raised in questioning of Professor Van-Tam in Module 2.

So, turning swiftly to the issues on the agenda, Rule 9s and evidence gathering. We're grateful for the updates. We've raised a number of issues. I'll raise them orally in two short sections, if I may, firstly, evidence gathering generally and, secondly, spotlight.

On the general level, we note the Inquiry has had to resort, as Ms Carey has set out this morning, to section 21 notices because document producers hadn't responded or hadn't responded sufficiently to requests made as long ago as last spring, and although that has achieved progress, as one would expect, much does remain from the updates outstanding.

We're not unsympathetic to the amount of work that goes into providing disclosure, we're not unsympathetic to the fact that many of the evidence providers are also engaged in providing services. However, the work that needs to be done doesn't get less if it's not attended to expeditiously, non-compliance makes things worse for the evidence providers themselves, and delay just causes problems elsewhere in the process.

The answer, the simple answer, is that document providers must do as the Inquiry requests within the timescales set, and we respectfully urge you to use section 20 perhaps more liberally in terms of ensuring that happens. Additional resources have to be allocated if necessary. And if they're not, the consequent delays will result in at least three effects, in our submission: one, the wasting of substantial amounts of public money; two, further untold stress to families, witnesses, all directly involved; and, three, impeding the reaching of your conclusions and recommendations which are so vital.

I'm sorry if all that sounds so obvious, but it needed saying, in my submission.

Moving on to spotlight hospitals, we note the explanation of how example facilities have been selected. We raise no objection in principle to this sort of approach, but we have raised a number of points in the written submissions from paragraphs 6 onwards. We would have raised these earlier had there been consultation about the spotlights and we might have been in a position to have assisted the Inquiry earlier and better had that happened.

The points we raise are in four categories. One, selection itself. Two, the evidence gathering from the chosen facilities. Three, whether the approach should be adopted for other healthcare facilities. And four, the issue of preparedness.

In respect of selection, we note what had been carefully set out in terms of the selection of hospitals across the four nations and jurisdictions and across population spread. We understand the approach, that it's designed to get a spread of evidence from across the UK, and we understand the questionnaire approach that was adopted to it, although we haven't had disclosure of those questionnaires as of yet.

No method of selection is going to be perfect, but, as we've set out in our written submissions, there are key issues that we would urge further consideration on. For example, and only by way of example, at paragraph 7, we've noted the choice of hospitals in Northern Ireland includes the main cities but not rural areas. We'll leave that to the Northern Ireland team to develop. And we've noted that both of the hospitals selected in Wales are in South Wales, which rather excludes the healthcare experience from across the rest of the country and the other health boards there, many of which are very different from the South Wales metropolises, and we note the Cymru team's written submissions on that too and we won't trespass on those.

Again, a minded-to approach might have allowed us to have assisted on that issue earlier.

Similarly, we've raised the point about whether the demographics of the areas of the hospitals were considered as well as the more straightforward issue of population spread.

In our submission, the different racial and ethnic minority communities served by hospitals is of great importance, and should have been part of the selection criteria.

We hope that the Inquiry will seek evidence from healthcare workers and bereaved families with experience from the spotlight hospitals, and also from further afield than the spotlight hospitals as well. As you've heard, we've submitted a schedule of summaries which we hope will help in that selection. I'll deal with that in a moment, freestanding as a topic, if I may. But just on this section of the spotlight hospitals, I note that one of the accounts by way of example that we've put forward is a bereaved family member who was also a frontline doctor during the pandemic and who in fact worked in a hospital in North Wales. So the selection of individuals such as that might help in dealing with some of the perceived deficiencies in the approach.

Secondly with respect to spotlight hospitals, evidence gathering. We note what's been said about seeking evidence from chief medical officers. We recognise and absolutely agree with the intention to go beyond the corporate view, but we do maintain our concerns that this isn't likely to achieve that, because CMOs are themselves members of health trusts and boards and they may have their own motivations to present what we've suggested might be a rose-tinted view.

So we urge the Inquiry to take a much wider view and seek evidence from patient groups, patient advice and liaison services, where that applies, trade unions and professional bodies, for example.

At paragraph 11 we've indicated our concerns that the timetable's ambitious to consider such a wide set of issues and evidence across four healthcare systems. We repeat an earlier submission that to make the spotlight approach work that it may be of assistance to commission a panel of experts to assist in analysing and honing the evidence so that only that which is important to the Inquiry need be called or can be collated by people with expertise in that kind of area.

We again indicate that we would be very much open, we would encourage a collaborative approach to this with your team. Calling evidence over 22 hospitals in such a short period of weeks is going to be challenging, and there need to be innovative ways presented of dealing with that.

We have raised, maybe too persistently, the issue of position statements. I'm not going to raise that issue again generally, but, with respect to spotlight hospitals, this is an area where seeking a corporate summary of what happened at particular institutions and trusts of what went right and wrong through their own lens may well be an effective way of, again, honing the ambit of the evidence. Position statements allow that to happen so that Rule 9s can then drill down into the detail, and there are a number of inquiries where that approach has been taken successfully.

Thirdly, on spotlights, we urge that a similar approach is taken with respect to other healthcare facilities and services, we've raised 111, 999, ambulance trusts, healthcare centres, GP surgeries and mental health facilities. Again, we're well recognising of the imperatives of time, but in order to do justice to the terms of reference for Module 3, a concentration primarily on hospitals is, in our submission, not taking the issues far enough.

Fourthly and finally, with respect to spotlights, preparedness. From paragraph 12 we've highlighted a concern that the Inquiry appears to be overlooking preparedness in this module. The examination of preparedness in Module 1 related to a high level only, not to the healthcare or social care sectors. We've set out in writing to remind the Inquiry what was said earlier by Counsel to the Inquiry in the earlier hearings, and in particular in the preliminary hearing for Module 1 where it was asserted that preparedness for healthcare and social care would be dealt with within their own modules, and we'd urge a rethink on that.

It's imperative, in our submission, that this is done. It's not sufficient that the position is restricted to staff shortages just prior to pandemic, as asserted in the CTI note. In our submission, the Inquiry should look at the plans from each of the 22 spotlight hospitals and health boards for a pandemic, what their understanding was of the applicable national planning related in particular to IPC, infection prevention and control, isolation, testing, visitation, resilience, staffing, bed capacity, surge capacity, triage systems, stockpiling, medical equipment, oxygen and PPE.

Moving on, evidence from bereaved witnesses. We've heard what's been said this morning. We're pleased that the Inquiry has decided to call a proportionate number of individuals with direct knowledge or experience of topics within Module 3. Many of our families have such experience of systemic themes. We urge a calling of a proportionate number of them to that end. The voices of bereaved family members and others are powerful within hearings themselves, and hearing the lived experience is of obvious importance to this Inquiry, as in just about all others.

We've provided a schedule. Again, we would be grateful for collaboration and co-operation with your team about where that's taken.

In selecting witnesses, we note that the Inquiry has, entirely properly, sought similar evidence from other CP groups. In the selection of the witnesses we ask you to have consideration of the central position of the bereaved, the substantial number of families CBFFJ represents across the four nations, we urge you to consider diversity, and we urge you to consider how the evidence is relevant to the systemic issues of Module 3.

We've raised the issue of discrimination. We've set this out in some detail in writing. We've addressed it regularly in each module. With respect, you have listened to us on those issues. But disparities of outcome for racialised minorities and issues relating to the treatment of disabled people amongst others are well known not just to the Inquiry but also there's a real importance to those issues within this module.

Issues of institutional discrimination within the health services, plural, are very much live issues, and we would absolutely encourage the Inquiry to rely on the evidence so far called but also to look carefully at it as to what other issues could be assisted by addendum reports from those experts or, indeed, possibly further reports from others. And those would include issues as to the disproportionate number of deaths of BAME healthcare workers compared to the demographics of the workforce, issues as to whether persons of particular minorities were disproportionately on the frontline and, if so, why, and issues of preparedness regarding protection with regard to particular characteristics or needs, PPE, but it goes beyond that of course.

In terms of disclosure, we're grateful for the update that's been provided. We note that there was very late disclosure in both Modules 1 and 2. On our analysis, by one month before the hearings we had received 42%, and 61% of the disclosure which ultimately came to us, that was one month before the hearings. Now, of course that was due certainly in part to the pace of the Inquiry and that it was working. There has been a longer period for preparation of Module 3, and therefore we hope that the recognition of these issues by Ms Carey this morning will lead to an earlier disclosure of the bulk of the material.

We're experienced enough to know that of course disclosure continues and so you can't put a stop date on it, but if there is a concentration, a real concentration, on the date that we've suggested and Ms Carey has mentioned this morning, the end of June, then that will help all of us. We are nervous about it, given the amount of disclosure that has been made to date, and the fact that we are only five months away, but we do hear that we're being listened to on this subject.

Experts. We've made submissions regarding consultation around experts and letters of instructions before, we don't resile from them but we're not going to repeat them again, they're in our written submissions again.

We would note that where we have been involved in putting forward experts, then our perception is that that has assisted the Inquiry, and therefore we would hope going forward that that would be borne in mind by your teams.

In our written submission we have raised one further particular note that hasn't been noted this morning, no reason it should have been, it's at paragraph 34 of our submissions, and we've asked you to consider instructing an expert to provide evidence of how healthcare systems of other countries fared.

We don't want to be misunderstood about this. We're not seeking wide-ranging evidence from across the globe, we're not seeking evidence to show where the UK should be positioned on some sort of international league table, that issue arose out of unevidenced assertions by the former Prime Minister, and we don't intend to go back to it.

The purpose of commissioning such a report here would be to look to lessons from elsewhere which might assist your analysis of what happened in the UK, but, more importantly, may inform recommendations, and we've suggested two countries, simply to keep the issue in proportion, in perspective. An expert report would not significantly affect the timetable. In our submission, countries should be selected in consultation with a suitable expert, and be of similar economic profile to the United Kingdom, countries perhaps such as South Korea and Germany, or perhaps Norway. But that, we say, should be a matter for discussion between the Inquiry and experts.

In the absence of such evidence, you'll be assessing what happened and what recommendations to make rather in the abstract. The Inquiry needs all the help it can get, and it appears to us that learning from elsewhere might be particularly helpful.

Finally, with respect to hearing dates, we've heard what Ms Carey has said. We simply note that there are two weeks of half term that covers most of the country; if the period of break of two weeks was pushed back by one week, it would cover both of those. We're not aware of what the problems with doing that are, but we would urge you to have a further look at that.

Those are our submissions, unless there's anything else I can assist with.

**Lady Hallett**: No, thank you very much indeed for your help, Mr Weatherby, very helpful.

I think, Mr Bindman, you're going to go next before we take a break.
