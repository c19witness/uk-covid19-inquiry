13. Submissions on Behalf of the British Medical Association, the National Pharmacy Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society by Ms Domingo
==================================================================================================================================================

**Ms Domingo**: Thank you, my Lady. I think my submissions today will also be reasonably brief.

My Lady, I will make three sets of submissions this afternoon on behalf of three separate core participant organisations, the BMA, the National Pharmacy Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

The submissions will focus on the key issues and lines of enquiry that each of these organisations consider essential for exploration by the Inquiry within Module 3, and these are the submissions on behalf of the British Medical Association.

As the Inquiry has heard in earlier modules, the pandemic had a tremendous impact on healthcare workers and their patients. The UK's health services entered the pandemic significantly understaffed and under-resourced, which severely affected the ability of these systems to weather the storm when Covid arrived. Healthcare staff worked tirelessly to safeguard the nation's health during the pandemic, often at great personal cost to their own physical and mental health.

The impacts of the pandemic were not felt equally for patients or for staff and many impacts continue to this day.

Module 3 is a key opportunity for the Inquiry to examine these experiences and ensure crucial lessons are learnt and improvements implemented.

The BMA's submissions today are focused on the issue of safety of healthcare workers during the pandemic, and they highlight how a number of critical safety failures placed healthcare workers at unnecessary risk. These include the inadequate provision of appropriate PPE and :outline:`RPE`, coupled with inadequate infection prevention and control guidance, as well as failures to comply with health and safety requirements such as risk assessments and the reporting of occupational death and disease.

The BMA has already detailed its very serious concerns about inadequate PPE, :outline:`RPE` and IPC guidance in Modules 1 and 2 and the impact this had on doctors and other healthcare workers on the frontline. However, the BMA considers that Module 3 will be the opportunity to address these issues in more detail. Of particular concern is the recommendation within IPC guidance in favour of the use of :outline:`fluid-resistant surgical masks` (:outline:`FRSM`) for the routine care of patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19. :outline:`FRSM masks are not PPE`. They do not provide adequate protection against :outline:`aerosol transmission`, and this particular issue is symptomatic of a wider failure to properly recognise the risk of :outline:`aerosol transmission` and to recommend and implement appropriate measures in response.

The evidence of Professor Catherine Noakes in Module 2 offered a number of explanations for the reluctance to fully acknowledge this risk, including the significant resource and operational implications for hospital infection control measures. This same issue is acknowledged within the technical report produced by the chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers, which is fully referenced within the BMA's written submissions, and identifies the management of PPE and best infection control advice as the issue that probably provided the greatest point of tension between medical practitioners and those trying to provide a standard approach to IPC.

The BMA submits that this widespread acknowledgement within the profession of the significance of the issue requires thorough consideration by the Inquiry, including the extent to which the safety of healthcare workers was compromised in favour of operational or cost considerations.

Connected to inadequate PPE and IPC is the failure to comply with health and safety legislation. All employers are subject to a legal duty to undertake suitable and sufficient risk assessments, yet there was a widespread failure to do so within healthcare settings, with 69% of doctors responding to a BMA survey who contracted Covid-19 in 2020 telling the BMA that they had not been individually risk assessed before acquiring Covid.

BMA surveys also identified that ethnic minority doctors more commonly went without PPE, felt worried or fearful about speaking out, and felt that risk assessments had been ineffective.

Similarly workplace protections are provided within the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrence Regulations 2013, or RIDDOR, which require the reporting of a disease attributed to occupational exposure to a biological agent.

However, despite healthcare workers being at significantly higher risk of Covid-19 infection because of the nature of their work, there was significant under-reporting of cases of Covid-19 in healthcare settings throughout the pandemic.

Reporting is crucial to understanding infections at health service staff level, how infection spreads within healthcare settings and how to better protect staff and patients. This is critical information during a pandemic like Covid-19. However, there was considerable under-reporting of disease and death under RIDDOR. This under-reporting has made it even more difficult for staff suffering from Long Covid to access financial recompense, and the BMA asks the Inquiry to consider the adequacy of the RIDDOR guidance produced by the Health and Safety Executive and whether there is any evidence that reporting was discouraged.

To conclude, while these submissions contain only brief selected examples of the ways in which the safety of healthcare workers were compromised, they evidence a systemic failure which the BMA asks the Inquiry to fully examine.

Sadly, there are doctors and healthcare workers who lost their lives due to inadequate protection at work and others who have suffered and continue to suffer significant physical and mental health impacts from working throughout the pandemic. This includes Long Covid, the impact of which remains, in far too many cases, ongoing and potentially career ending.

These are extremely serious issues that require careful scrutiny by the Inquiry, so that meaningful and effective improvement can take place, and the BMA asks that they are examined in detail within the Module 3 hearings.

My Lady, shall I move on to --

**Lady Hallett**: Certainly, thank you.

**Ms Domingo**: I shall move on to the submissions on behalf of the National Pharmacy Association.

These submissions highlight three principal issues that the NPA considers relevant to the scope of Module 3 and that ought to be examined within the Module 3 hearings later this year.

The first issue is the central role that community pharmacy plays in local communities and in tackling health inequalities across the UK.

Community pharmacies are part of primary care and they have a unique understanding of the health needs of the populations and the communities they serve. They are disproportionately located in areas of higher deprivation, delivering health services to communities that need them most, and they play a crucial role in reducing health inequalities. A local pharmacy is one of the few places where patients can walk in off the street and access healthcare advice and treatment without an appointment.

During the pandemic, community pharmacies played a core role in maintaining access to healthcare services. They became the first port of call for many patients, and NPA members experienced a huge increase in demand for healthcare advice and medicines, including an increase in the number of patients seeking advice for more serious health or mental health conditions.

NPA members reported a significant increase in the number of prescriptions dispensed from February to March 2020, and phone calls to pharmacies more than tripled during this period. Home deliveries of medication to vulnerable patients more than doubled, and many pharmacies experienced long queues outside their doors.

The role played by community pharmacy during the pandemic provided crucial support and resilience to the healthcare system. Pharmacists and their teams worked tirelessly to maintain service provision and ensure the supply of medicines to their local populations. Many medicines became difficult to source, and expensive as demand outstripped supply, and staff spent long hours sourcing medicines.

The increased demand on community pharmacy during the pandemic had a significant impact on pharmacists and their teams, resulting in stress, fatigue and mental health issues for many NPA members. Given the essential nature of their frontline role, the Inquiry is asked to consider whether there was sufficient investment by government in the infrastructure needed to integrate community pharmacy into the broader health system and to support effective co-operation across the health service.

The second key issue is that community pharmacy was often overlooked and under-recognised. Despite the central role played by community pharmacy in the delivery of NHS care throughout the pandemic, community pharmacists and their teams were not given comparable treatment to other frontline healthcare workers, which meant that often they did not receive the support that they needed.

The most significant and demoralising example of the different way in which community pharmacy was treated by government was the initial exclusion of pharmacy workers from the life assurance scheme for frontline workers in England. The NPA asks the Inquiry to fully investigate the circumstances that gave rise to this omission.

Another example relates to PPE, which was not initially available to community pharmacy through the NHS, requiring many pharmacy teams to source and fund their own protective equipment.

The supply of PPE was a challenge and pharmacy teams put themselves at risk to help patients stay well, often working in close proximity to others and reusing PPE repeatedly for days or even weeks.

The NPA suggests that the Inquiry examines whether government properly and fairly considered the circumstances of all healthcare workers who contributed to the pandemic response.

Thirdly, the Inquiry is asked to consider the resilience of the independent community pharmacy sector in responding to a future pandemic. Community pharmacy entered the pandemic facing financial and workforce crises due to long-term underinvestment in the network. These issues presented significant challenges for community pharmacy in responding to the pandemic and increased the difficulties in providing services to patients and maintaining staffing levels. Even though the pandemic clearly showed that pharmacies are an essential part of health and social care, real-term funding cuts have continued and the independent community pharmacy sector find itself in a worse situation than at the outset of the pandemic, with pharmacies closing at the rate of approximately eight per week.

A strong community pharmacy network is an essential element of healthcare services in the UK, and the NPA invites the Inquiry to consider the role of community pharmacy in pandemic planning and in the overall resilience of the UK's healthcare system to respond to a future pandemic.

I have one final set of submissions. Shall I proceed?

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, please.

**Ms Domingo**: My Lady, the third and final set of submissions are made on behalf of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. They highlight five key areas that the RPS submits should be examined by the Inquiry in Module 3.

First, safety at work for pharmacists. Failures to ensure the safety of healthcare workers and pharmacy teams including through appropriate use of risk assessments and the provision of suitable PPE must be considered. The Inquiry is specifically asked to examine whether rules on testing, contact tracing and self-isolation, including infection prevention and control guidance, were appropriate for all healthcare settings, including pharmacies.

For example, social distancing in pharmacy settings was often impractical and the RPS received reports of inconsistent approaches to self-isolation rules around the country, which potentially meant that some pharmacies had to close or were no longer able to support patient care.

Second, the role played by pharmacists working within hospital settings. The work of pharmacists within hospitals is sometimes overlooked. During the pandemic, hospital pharmacists cared for the most critically ill patients with Covid-19, transforming services to support colleagues and ensuring the supply of medicines for critical care. Pharmacists also played a key role in rapidly establishing field hospitals, and the RPS submits that these contributions should be examined in Module 3.

Third, a significant concern which is shared with the NPA, the repeated and systemic difference in treatments between pharmacists who provided NHS-contracted services compared with healthcare workers directly employed by the NHS.

The disparity in treatment can be seen in the exclusion of pharmacists from visa extensions provided to other healthcare workers in March 2020, in the absence of specific mention of pharmacists and their teams in guidance regarding key workers, which impacted childcare provision at school hubs and, perhaps most egregiously, in the omission of pharmacists from the life assurance scheme for the families of frontline health and care workers in England in April 2020.

Despite their crucial role providing care throughout the pandemic, the pharmacy profession, and particularly community pharmacy, was often an afterthought in government planning, guidance and communications, and this had a hugely detrimental impact on their morale and wellbeing.

Fourth, the resilience of pharmacy services in the event of a future pandemic or health emergency.

During the Covid pandemic, community pharmacies were easily accessible and provided vital medication, health advice, testing and vaccinations; they played a pivotal role in protecting the health of their communities. However, community pharmacy is under very significant pressure, which is leading to the closure of pharmacies in local communities. There is also a significant concern around the health and wellbeing of pharmacists and their staff and workforce capacity. The pandemic placed enormous strain on staff, and RPS workforce surveys demonstrate that pharmacists are suffering from burn-out and Long Covid. At the start of the pandemic, access to wellbeing services was not universal across the UK and the RPS submits that all pharmacists should have equal access to wellbeing support, including for Long Covid, regardless of where they work.

The pandemic exposed the international complexity of the medicines supply chain, leading to shortages of many commonly used medicines such as paracetamol, as well as medicines used in critical care. In the years since, it has become increasingly common to see medicines shortages within fragile supply chains, and the RPS has recently launched a new research project to examine this issue in more detail.

The Inquiry is asked to consider the resilience of medication supply and pharmacy services across all care settings in the event of a future pandemic, specifically the current investment and planning in the medicines supply chain, in medicines production facilities, including aseptic pharmacy facilities in hospitals, and in the role of frontline and volunteer workforce in preparation for future pandemics.

The fifth point is on lessons learned.

The RPS submits that lessons learnt must include longer-term reforms to better manage demand and build resilience across the health service. The pandemic highlighted the need for professional empowerments and regulatory flexibilities to allow all health professionals to put patients first. This included steps to help pharmacists better manage the impact of medicine shortages on patient care, such as enabling the re-use of unused medicines in care homes and hospices.

The RPS also wishes to emphasise the importance of early engagement by government and NHS leadership with pharmacy stakeholders. For example, around medicine delivery services and supporting the planning and roll-out of the mass vaccination programme and the need for pharmacists in all care settings to have read and write access to patient records to support patient care.

The RPS encourages the Inquiry to seek to identify lessons such as these so that they can be embedded within working practices going forward, to ensure that we are better prepared in the future.

Finally and in relation to experts, it was mentioned earlier this morning by Counsel to the Inquiry that the RPS seeks the appointment of an expert in pharmacy and I wish to clarify that the RPS is not proposing an additional expert witness, rather that the instructed experts -- for example in critical care, primary care, and IPC -- take account of the role played by pharmacists and the impact on pharmacists and pharmacy settings.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Domingo.

Anything by way of response, Ms Carey?

**Ms Carey**: Nothing from me, my Lady.
