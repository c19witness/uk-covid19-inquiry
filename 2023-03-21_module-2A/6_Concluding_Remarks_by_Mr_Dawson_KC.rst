6. Concluding Remarks by Mr Dawson KC
=====================================

**Mr Dawson**: I do, my Lady, albeit very briefly.

If I could reiterate the thanks which I extended earlier to those who have participated so actively in and around this preliminary hearing, as you yourself have identified, a number of the submissions which have been made are very Scottish-specific and, certainly from our point of view, incredibly helpful.

In that regard may I reiterate what you have already said, my Lady, that the requests for further information which have been made by Core Participants have all been noted and will indeed be followed up by members of our team.   Indeed, in the spirit of co-operation which has been fostered, it may well indeed be the case that we seek further information from Core Participants on suggestions they have made in order to be able to take them forward as efficiently as possible.   I note that a number of the Core Participants' representatives have offered that they would do that, which is also extremely helpful. With regard to the particular submissions that have been made, there are a few observations which I would make. With regard to the submissions made by Mr Friedman, there are two points which he made in relation to the planning for the hearings, which I would like to say that we agree with him on.   The first is that the time for the hearings in this module as currently planned are short and that, as I have already tried to outline, we agree with him that the best way to try to deal with that situation is to try to encourage a spirit and a practice of early Core Participant engagement, and I have outlined in the main body of my submissions various ways which we intend to do that.

This is precisely why.   We appreciate the full submissions which he has made on behalf of his clients, and indeed others have made, and indeed the very practical suggestions as to the ways in which we might foster that spirit of co-operation further. As regards Ms Gallagher's submissions on behalf of the TUC and STUC, there is one point which I would simply wish to draw attention to.   That is what she described as the strand-tying requirement, whereby decision-making in the four nations of the United Kingdom can be looked at compared, considered and contrasted.   I would acknowledge, as she correctly represented, that this is a matter on which the clients whom she represents have made forceful submissions for some time, including at the first preliminary hearing. This is a matter of considerable importance, and indeed links into a point which has been made in specific context by Ms Mitchell on behalf of Scottish Covid Bereaved, that this Inquiry is uniquely placed to be able to derive information and reach conclusions and make recommendations based on the different approaches taken by the four nations of the UK.    This is a matter which, as your Ladyship will understand, causes difficulty in the sense of how we go about precisely resolving that.    That is a matter which, internally I can assure you, is a matter of active consideration amongst the teams which are responsible for the delivery of the four modules and, insofar as progress is made on that, that is a matter of course which will be intimated to Core Participants through our module in the usual way through monthly reports and otherwise.

Other than that, my Lady, those are the only specific matters on which I felt it appropriate to address your Ladyship further.    Unless there's anything further which you would like to hear from me, that's all I have to say.

**Baroness Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Dawson.

I have already thanked the Core Participants for their written submissions.    I should now like to thank them all for their oral submissions and for their excellent timing.

All the submissions I have heard this morning were focused, constructive and very helpful and that bodes well for the future of this Module 2A.     So thank you

everybody for your attendance today.
