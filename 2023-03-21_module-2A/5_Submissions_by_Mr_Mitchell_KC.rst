5. Submissions by Mr Mitchell KC
================================

**Mr Mitchell**: Good afternoon, my Lady.     Can I just check that my Lady can see and hear me okay?

**Baroness Hallett**: I can.     Thank you very much.

**Mr Mitchell**: Good.   Thank you.

My brief submission today, made on behalf of the Scottish Ministers, highlights two points which either are currently proving to be or will, in due course, prove to be of great assistance in preparing for the UK and the Scottish Inquiry.

These points too will, I suspect, also be of interest to members of the public who are not involved in the day-to-day preparation for the Inquiries, but who have a natural interest in the progress of the Inquiries and indeed their outcome. The first point relates to the memorandum of understanding, which we have heard quite a bit about today.     Observers will know that the UK and Scottish Inquiries have been charged with examining many of the same issues surrounding Covid and its handling by the UK government and the Scottish government. It is only right and proper that both the UK Inquiry and the Scottish Inquiry examine those issues from their own standpoints.     But it makes sense, of course, where possible, not to duplicate the investigative and preparatory work and indeed, where appropriate, for there to be a single set of conclusions on a particular issue. The public has a right to expect that if money will be well spent and the memorandum of understanding, which essentially seeks the most efficient way over the hurdles that are thrown up by two Inquiries running at the same time, seems to us, respectfully, to do that.

In addition to having one eye on the public purse, the memorandum should assist Core Participants, in particular those such as the Scottish Ministers, who will provide the bulk of the documents to the Inquiries.

That process of ingathering, collating and ultimately supplying to the Inquiries those documents which the Inquiries have requested, has been proceeding at pace now for several months.     It is going well and ministers are committed to that process.    However, of course, assistance is always welcome and the memorandum ought to provide that assistance. The second point was foreshadowed in my first point and that is co-operation with the Inquiry.     I simply want to mention the good working relationship that has developed between the UK Inquiry and the Scottish government. As already mentioned, the Scottish government has been working hard to provide the Inquiry is a significant volume of evidence, both documentary and in the form of witness statements, in response to the Inquiry's requests.   The Scottish government's engagement with the Inquiry team that is overseeing Module 2A, has been extremely positive and we are grateful to the Inquiry team for their understanding and co-operation, while the evidence is ingathered and ultimately produced.

The Scottish government would be happy to facilitate the sharing of the material between the two Inquiries or to assist in any other way that is felt necessary.

Finally, as an addendum, the point has already been made as to the desirability of avoiding clashes between the UK and Scottish Inquiry insofar as the choosing of dates for public hearings is concerned, and we would simply add our voice to those who have already made the point.

My Lady, that is all I have to say on behalf of the Scottish Ministers today unless there is any particular issue I can help my Lady with.

**Baroness Hallett**: No, thank you very much, Mr Mitchell. I'm very grateful.

**Mr Mitchell**: Thank you.

**Baroness Hallett**: Mr Dawson, do you have any concluding remarks?
