Transcript of Module 2 Public Hearing on 13 December 2023

*(10.00 am)*

*Procedural matters*

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, before we start the process of hearing the oral submissions from the core participants, may I raise two procedural matters.

The first matter relates to the issue of the evening notes prepared by Sir Patrick Vallance. You will recall that during Module 2, during the oral hearing, you ruled on an interim basis that only individual extracts from the transcribed notes be put up on the screen, and thereby published.

On 7 December, you provisionally indicated to the core participants, through an email from Laura Taylor, that you were minded to adhere to the approach which you had adopted earlier in the hearing, which was that only the excerpts, the individual excerpts to which reference had been made, would be published.

That email was sent to the core participants, and they were given an opportunity to make submissions in response to your provisional minded position, but no submissions have been received in response, and therefore may I ask you to make that provisional finding final, and to direct that your ruling be published.

**Lady Hallett**: I do. Thank you very much.

**Mr Keith**: Secondly, in relation to the documents which are to be published, you of course are aware that some 750 documents have already been published on the Inquiry website in relation to Module 2. Of those 750 or so, around 270 were only published in part. Those in part published documents are to be published in full, and therefore they will go on to the website on Monday, once time has been allowed for them to be rechecked.

In addition, the Inquiry legal team has prepared a list of some 430 additional documents which it is proposed should be published. That list, about 700 in all, has been provided to the core participants and they've had an ability to indicate whether or not there are any additional documents that they would wish you to publish.

The position that has now been reached is this: that when they make their written submissions, they may only refer to documents which have been published. If there are any additional documents which they consider it necessary to reference in their written submissions, then we would ask that they identify them to the Inquiry by 8 January and, if necessary, further permission can be sought from you to have any additional documents published. Obviously only documents which have been published, and which have been published with your permission, can be referenced in their written submissions.

So may I have your permission to publish that list of documents for the purposes of Module 2?

**Lady Hallett**: You do. Thank you very much.

**Mr Keith**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

I'm now going to hear from core participants in their closing submissions. Just to repeat something I've said this week already, but that as I think all the core participants present know, I appreciate the very tight timetable in preparing submissions and therefore I will also bear in mind the written submissions that core participants make when they've had greater time to reflect on all the evidence that's been gathered and that we've heard.

So, Ms Morris, I think you're starting.

1. Submissions on Behalf of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK by Ms Morris KC
=========================================================================================

**Ms Morris**: Thank you, my Lady.

My Lady, as you know, I make submissions on behalf of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK.

My Lady, according to members of his own team, for Boris Johnson's skillset, Covid was the wrong crisis. He was referred to as a trolley by his most senior adviser, oscillating from one position to another said his head of communications, and as having ostrich syndrome by one of his own ministers.

It is striking that these were not the words of a variety of people from within Number 10 and the Cabinet. They're not my words, they're not the families' words, they're not the words of his political adversaries; they are the words from people within Mr Johnson's own team.

Regrettably for the bereaved families, and regrettably for the whole country, Covid exposures the weaknesses of Mr Johnson and the fractious nature of his dysfunctional administration. Contrary to some of the ill-informed articles in tabloids, this Inquiry is not examining the rights and wrongs of Brexit. It is not interested in the political colours of those in government at the time. It is certainly not going to be distracted by the soap opera, the language or internecine squabbles in various WhatsApps or other messaging. This is not a court of politics or a moral maze. It is, however, a tribunal of evidence.

The real question is whether the Prime Minister and the political leadership were decisive and proactive, or was their response at every turn reactive, too little, too late? Was the machinery of government, both its advisers and its officials, organised in a fit and efficient manner, working in lockstep with each other for the good of the country?

For the thousands that we represent, Mr Johnson is the reason that many of them are here. He was the captain of HMS United Kingdom, pretending that the iceberg it was steaming towards was a figment of the imagination. All the while his lieutenant, Matt Hancock, was conducting the orchestra to play on deck, telling all that everything was fine and plans were in place. Unfortunately, the reality was the opposite, the iceberg was only too real and it was the plans which were a figment of the imagination.

In his evidence, Mr Johnson acknowledged that mistakes had been made and he said that as the PM at the time, he accepted personal responsibility for them. Anyone watching might have thought this was a laudable approach until Mr Keith asked him the question that all of us who'd actually read Mr Johnson's witness statement were thinking: what mistakes was he actually saying sorry for?

It is, of course, a matter for you, but you may think that through his whole evidence, Mr Johnson hardly acknowledged any failures. If that is your view, then his apologies were hollow and, you may think, designed to demonstrate a humility, a previously undiagnosed characteristic.

Regarding the early stages of the response, there are at least three key features to the Johnson book of excuses.

First, the UK actually didn't do as badly as some had predicted. Second, if only the UK had been able to recognise the danger of the virus as it came towards us, in particular asymptomatic transmission, then we could have ramped up preparation straightaway. And third, that we were taken by surprise at how far along the curve we were in early March.

We emphatically reject all three of these propositions.

On a separate but important point, whilst accepting that it will be the subject of another module, we also disagree with the narrative that both Mr Johnson and Mr Hancock promoted that the NHS was not overwhelmed. We say, my Lady, that you must look at the overall impact on the whole healthcare system in future modules, including who it could and could not treat, and this proposition must be examined in detail.

But returning back to the three propositions.

First, the Inquiry should be inherently wary of a "we didn't do too badly" narrative, which can only be a basis for complacency going forward. There is no foundation whatsoever for the narrative that, despite the criticisms and predictions, the UK did okay. This bold sweeping assertion is remarkable for one thing: it has no factual basis. If there was a basis for it, no doubt Mr Johnson and his team of lawyers would have exhibited the evidence. They have not.

The Inquiry itself has sought the best and most objective international comparison evidence, and published it together with a document carefully setting out the basis for the statistics. It shows the UK did very poorly against all but one comparable European country. This was analysis based on age-standardised excess death mortality rates set against a five-year average, a carefully thought through metric. The data came from the ONS, not some think tank, poll or politically charged body or expert. The European data came from Eurostat, widely recognised as reliably standardised and quality assured across the continent. The analysis that the UK was close to the bottom in class does not come from the families but from the data itself, underlined by the commentary of reputable bodies, including the King's Fund.

Whereas the evidence of the global picture is undoubtedly less robust than the European one because of differences in data, again, reputable and properly evidenced studies from the Johns Hopkins institute of medicine, amongst others, paint a similar picture of the UK doing very badly indeed against global comparisons. The response of Mr Johnson was that this evidence didn't stack up. That is for you to decide, my Lady, but we respectfully suggest it will not be an issue which will detain you for too long.

Mr Johnson also referred to the fact that the UK had its own unique characteristics. That is not in dispute. We have commented on its island geography, its wealth, its advanced healthcare and public health systems, and one might think these were significant advantages, but Mr Johnson said the UK has a higher population density and more older people than many other countries. As a headline, that is so, although it is an English-centric view so far as population density is concerned, as it varies considerably across Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.

We do not doubt the population density is a very relevant issue but it's by no means one which leads to an inevitable higher mortality rate. We have already raised the example of South Korea, a country with a population density almost twice as high and with more older people but a mortality rate a quarter of the UK. Germany has a similar population density and higher proportion of older people but a far lower Covid mortality rate. Singapore is a much denser population centre, with similar population age profile, but again had a far lower Covid mortality.

Mr Johnson continued to deflect away from awkward facts and evidence by hand-wringing about how it had all been different, if only we could have seen the problem coming over the horizon, and in particular asymptomatic transmission, and telling us that the real problem was that no one knew where the UK was on the curve until we were into March.

Once again we say that reality, awkward things called facts and evidence, get in the way of his narrative.

The reality was that in January and February 2020 he was telling those that would listen that this was a false alarm and that the overreaction would damage the economy. Eminent scientists were under no such delusion. By early January the UK had designated Covid as a high-consequence infectious disease. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told us that by 16 January his instinct was telling him that this would turn out to be a dangerous pandemic. Later in January clear documentary evidence shows us that Professors Farrar, Woolhouse and Ferguson were sounding the alarm, as were Professors Whitty and Vallance, who were, of course, at the centre of advice to government.

There was evidence from China, confirmed by the diplomatic telegram we've seen, as early as 26 January, that there was confirmed asymptomatic transmission, human to human, not anecdotal evidence but confirmed from the director of -- the minister of health. Further reports from Germany around the same time confirmed that picture, followed only days later by the Diamond Princess mass outbreak in early Feb.

Contrary to Mr Johnson's assertion, crucial matters like asymptomatic transmission were identified as early as January. The problem was that the warnings were not heeded.

By this time some things had been done, COBR had been stood up, as had SAGE; but without leadership, too little followed, and I highlight three central matters: plans, PPE and tests.

Once the possibility of a pandemic arose by mid-January at the latest, one might have thought that anyone with an interest in an emerging civil emergency which would include the Prime Minister, the Health Secretary, the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, the CMO, the GCSA, would instinctively reach for the plans, the pandemic playbook. For the avoidance of doubt, my Lady, I touch lightly on the fact that the absence of pandemic planning should have been well known to all, because of the evidence you've heard in Module 1, but from early January why was the absence of plans seemingly not a big deal? The only real evidence of this is the contact between Mr Cummings and Mr Hancock where the Health Secretary assures the PM's most senior adviser that everything's in order and the plans have all been reviewed.

Irrespective of whether the view was that the pandemic was on its way or that it was 50/50 or that it was likely to be a false alarm, it is beyond argument that this was the moment to recognise that there was a major hole in planning that needed to be filled immediately, but precious little followed.

Where was the attention to increasing the bed capacity and the availability of healthcare staff or even to scope what wasn't and was in place in social care? We know from Helen Whately, Minister for Social Care, that only in March did she recognise the lack of infection control plans in care homes.

What was done regarding PPE? It is crystal clear that as of January there were insufficient stockpiles of PPE. No one seems to have known what there was and where. There also seems to have been scant understanding of need, in particular in the care sector, and no real distribution or management plan.

By mid-March PPE requirements for doctors and nurses and cleaners and others working in Covid wards were downgraded.

I repeat, downgraded.

We say the only reason for this was the lack of proper PPE. Why? Partly because of the failure to stockpile and plan for management during a crisis, and partly because of a failure to surge manufacturing or procurement capacity once the pandemic was on the horizon.

We've all seen the headlines in early April 2020 with the BBC, The Daily Telegraph, covering shocking accounts of frontline healthcare workers making their own protective equipment from bin liners.

Then there's a story of tests. UK scientists had devised a Covid test admirably early in January. The problem was not the UK did not have a test, it was that our government failed to surge manufacture or procure anywhere near the required capacity until much later in the pandemic. Producing or sourcing tests was no doubt less than straightforward, but it was an entirely predictable problem. Some other countries did so. By mid-March South Korea had conducted five times the number of tests undertaken in the UK.

From the beginning of January the failure to address what Mr Hancock described as a "woefully inadequate" preparedness and jump start a rapid emergency response was primarily a failure of leadership. But by early March, instead of leading the catch-up, Mr Johnson was doing a photo shoot at the Royal Free Hospital shaking hands with patients with Covid and telling the press he was proud to have done so. By this point we could all see on the television parts of Italy were being overwhelmed by the virus, 11 municipalities had been quarantined by order of the government on 23 February, yet our government floundered: already out of date action plans but little meaningful action. Mr Johnson's point that the UK was taken by surprise by how far along the curve we were by early March has to be seen against that background.

Without testing capacity it was always going to be difficult to understand where things were, but the rapid take-off of exponential growth was not an unknown, far from it. The PM did not need his advisers to explain exponential growth, he did not need to understand graphs, he just needed to turn the television on.

And so we reach the first lockdown, 23 March. There seems to be almost unanimity amongst witnesses that the first lockdown could not have been avoided. Equally, it should have been sooner. Mr Hancock says the beginning of March, Patrick Vallance said the lockdown was at least a week too late. So the message, we say, is clear: it should have been earlier and harder.

I say unanimity amongst witnesses because it will not have escaped your attention, my Lady, that there have been a number of tabloid articles and questions by some politicians and other commentators as to whether lockdowns were necessary at all. Apparently they were anathema to some Halcyon days of British libertarian values and the cost was too high.

We have no doubt that you'll have no hesitation in following the evidence and tuning out from the background noise outside of these walls. Where evidence has questioned the need for or the efficiency of lockdowns, it has been carefully dealt with. You'll recall the dismantling of the Great Barrington Declaration hypothesis by Professor Whitty, the idea that the vulnerable could be shielded whilst the rest of us got on with life as normal. Quite how the vulnerable were to be defined and identified was the first problem but shielding them whilst the virus circulated amongst the rest of the population would have been impossible.

There is nothing antilibertarian about temporary emergency public health measures to save lives, any more than there is anything authoritarian about the binding legal requirement on the state to do everything reasonably possible to protect life pursuant to Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Sorry to disappoint those who would cast lockdowns as part of a culture war, but the Human Rights Act and English common law are both agreed on this.

The point about earlier and harder lockdowns is that they hit the curve at a lower point. It is quicker and easier to flatten the curve before it is out of control. Quicker and easier means less economic damage, less damage to our children, less risk for those escaping domestic violence, less mental health impact, less disproportionate impact on ethnic minority communities, the disabled and the most economically disadvantaged.

The fallacy of the lockdown argument is that there is some balance to be struck between public health damage and the economy and other societal damage. Protecting lives protected the economy and minimised other societal damage. Protecting the economy required decisive, swift action, not standing back. Protecting the economy goes hand in hand with a healthy workforce, and that requires first rate health services with resilience when there is an emergency.

I've raised the background noise of ideological commentaries outside the Inquiry because it's been upsetting to those I represent and needed to be addressed as such, however it links to my next point. No one considered lockdown a cure and any informed person would know that a further wave or waves would follow. What came after any lockdown was therefore crucial. At some point the curve would be lowered to a point where it was proportionate to ease restrictions. Decisions would be taken to ease back some of the semblance of normality whilst careful monitoring and ongoing measures would be needed to keep the curve low. Escalation of measures was a probability if not a certainty.

What in fact happened was further dither and delay, disconnected from the science, and with the PM and his administration still looking over their shoulders to the ideological doubters. Having suggested that they first followed the science with respect to measures up and including the first lockdown, Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak then embarked on Eat Out to Help Out.

Having successfully, if belatedly, reduced the infection rate, this policy provided state subsidies for people to gather for long periods and in closed spaces. Despite the assertion from Mr Johnson that it had been considered and advanced by Professors Whitty and Vallance, that was plainly not the case. Again, there was almost unanimity that Eat Out to Help Out was a terrible idea and one which witness after witness would have counselled against, if only they'd been asked.

Although it's difficult to evidence the effect of Eat Out to Help Out, Patrick Vallance was able to say that it must have increased infection rates and highly likely to have increased the number of deaths.

It is clear from the documents that the government realised just how much worse the figures were getting over the summer. You'll remember that Patrick Vallance diary entry where he recalls Mr Johnson lamenting that things were getting back to the "grim" days of March, recognising that things had to be done, recognising and exclaiming in colourful terms that he was going to have to go against a certain section of the media. It might be thought that this was the sort of decisive leadership that had been absent so far. That was 11 September.

Ten days later, SAGE 58 recommended a circuit-breaker as part of a connected package of measures to reverse the exponential rise in cases. But the dynamic realisation of 11 September had evaporated by then. The science was not followed. Instead, the government embarked upon a series of tiering measures which were doomed to fail and did so.

What was most striking about the tiers system was that the government did not seek advice from SAGE or anyone else about it. What this demonstrates, my Lady, is that even in a face of the realisation of the dire situation developing over summer 2020, Mr Johnson and his government floundered in the face of ideological opposition and ignored scientific advice. The result was a colossal loss of life in a second wave and a longer and more damaging second lockdown.

I want to pick up on three more threads: following the science; the failure to mitigate foreseeable disproportionate impacts; and governance. There is also a common golden thread, a lack of proper systems in place, crucial for when the next storm gathers.

On the evidence, it is clear that an eclectic mix of eminent and concerned scientists were raising the alarm as the pandemic emerged. It is equally clear that many eminent scientists came together as volunteers in the pop-up committee that was SAGE and did their level best. This is not an attack on any of the scientists. We are well equipped with eminent experts in all four corners of the United Kingdom; what was missing was their organisation.

In Module 1 we've asked to you conclude and recommend that the UK should have a standing scientific committee on pandemics; not an original idea as the Scottish Government already has one set up. A standing committee would bring together relevant scientific minds in peacetime. It would be able to spot existing major lacunae, such as the fact that there wasn't any pandemic plan, such as a lack of resilience in the health and social care sector, and no excess bed capacity and hence no ability to meet a public health emergency.

A standing committee would be able to gather learning from other parts of the world about their experiences of other diseases. It would be able to advise on what was needed for surge manufacturing, sourcing of tests, lab analysis and PPE. It would be able to gather advance thinking on NPIs, their efficacy and how they might work together in different scenarios. Instead what we had was a pop-up, a standing start a month into the emergency. How is that the best use of our expertise?

Without the joined-up learning that a standing committee would bring, incredible responsibility is placed upon key advisers close to government, and no doubt pressure is placed upon them. Professor Whitty accepts that asymptomatic transmission was known from early on, but there were doubts as to its impact. He thought border controls and screening generally did not work, and stopping mass gatherings would not make of difference. And above all he advised not to take policy decisions too early in case there was behavioural fatigue.

Would a dedicated standing committee have taken such a cautious approach or would it have taken asymptomatic transmission as a red flag until or unless it was proven less forceable? Would it have counselled hesitation or would it have urged to go early and go hard on NPIs because it would have had the learning to understand that imperative before the exponential explosion rendered them less effective? Would it have taken a nuanced approach to implementing border measures and restricting mass gatherings, as did other countries who achieved more successful outcomes, rather than serially rejecting them as ineffective? Would a standing committee have pushed hard in peacetime, and indeed at the start of the emergency, for testing capacity and for a fully functioning TTI scheme? We think so.

The lack of testing capacity meant that Professor Whitty and others were flying blind on where we were on the curve. Without resilience and tests, scientists had to go along with discharging thousands of older people from hospitals to the care sector without proper infection control. Without PPE our brave care workers and key workers, including doctors, nurses and cleaners, were left shamefully unprotected. Did the lack of PPE influence scientists to downgrade Covid in mid-March from an HCID so that doctors and others could be asked to use :outline:`paper masks` on Covid wards rather than :outline:`respirators`? How else can one explain the fact that in the eye of storm, as the infection rate exploded in mid-March, the fifth worst pandemic in history, ranked by order of human deaths, was now not considered a high-consequence disease.

We are not criticising the scientists here. What was absent was not expertise but organised standing learning and evidenced contingency measures to respond to various pandemic characteristics.

The Inquiry has heard a great deal of expert evidence regarding disproportionate impact and structural discrimination of various kinds. All diseases affect people with different characteristics differently. It is obvious that this would be the case with a pathogen such as Covid. Some of those differences will not be apparent until the path of the disease is observed. However, many disproportionate impacts are predictable to a significant degree and therefore foreseeable.

The devastating and disproportionate effect of Covid on people living with various disabilities, including learning difficulties, autism and Down's, for example, was entirely foreseeable. Disproportionate impact on various black and ethnic minority communities was predictable too, but the evidence shows that little or no thinking was given to these issues until data became available quite late in the pandemic. Why was the Ethnicity Subgroup of SAGE not formed until late August 2020? Why was no apparent consideration given to the provision of racially, culturally or gender-appropriate PPE? Was it not obvious that structural issues meant that key frontline workforces are disproportionate numbers from particular ethnic groups and that needed to be addressed ahead of time?

What was particularly upsetting for our families was evidence from an Equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, who seemed to both minimise structural race issues but also suggest that addressing disproportionate impact was unlawful under the legislation.

To remind you of just two pieces was her evidence, Ms Badenoch suggested that the evidence has shown that being an ethnic minority was not the cause of being disproportionately impacted, it correlated with what the causes were, the comorbidities. That was absolutely not the evidence. Disproportionate impact was related to structural issues such as the fact that black and ethnic minority workers make up a huge proportion of the health service and care sectors and transport and the gig economy, all high-risk.

Later, Ms Badenoch chose an example of Pakistani taxi drivers and that it would be wrong to provide measures aimed at alleviating their risks because there were also white drivers and targeted measures were unlawful, she said. No one was suggesting that black workers should be favoured over white workers, but measures aimed at addressing disproportionate impact are plainly not favouring persons of one background over another. And equally plainly, they were not unlawful in the way suggested.

The failure to address disproportionate impacts was, in our submission, itself an aspect of structural discrimination and the views of an Equalities minister appears to triumph ideology over reality and the law.

My Lady, in terms of governance, the evidence exposed the shortcomings of the workings of central government. Below the ministerial level we have seen the interface of the political officials and civil servants. In many, perhaps most, administrations this may work perfectly well, with clear demarcation of roles and due deference between them. However, we have witnessed what happens when that is absent, with an avowed disrupter brought into the centre.

He who Mr Johnson could not bring himself to name in evidence was given almost unfettered power and used it -- or, more accurately, misused it. Undeniably, Dominic Cummings and others around him were allowed to create a toxic atmosphere, white and male, which scared off competent others and created a dysfunctionality we have seen through countless messages stirring up internecine conflict. Add to that a culture of indifference to abiding by their own regulations, and the evidence exposes the Johnson administration to have been rotten to its core.

How to put that right is another matter. Professionalising a system of SpAds and political appointees is more difficult still, as it performs part of the democratic remit of governance. But there are potential measures which the Inquiry may consider, such as a transparent system of reviewing diversity and culture at the heart of government, which may be appropriate going forward.

My Lady, you will know that I have made it through this short submission without reference to the detail of the messaging or the language. Ingenious devices have been advanced by many as to why the Inquiry should take a circumspect view of WhatsApps and emails and late night notes. Whilst accepting that they have a different status to formal meeting minutes, we reject all attempts to diminish their importance. This evidence is not ephemeral, as has been suggested. Sounding off some of them might be. More brutal due to the brevity of WhatsApp character limit, maybe. But these are generally invaluable contemporaneous evidence which every forensic process seeks.

My Lady, if the failings of Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak, Mr Hancock, Mr Cummings and others are laid bare by their own unguarded comments, they have only themselves to blame.

Those are my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Morris.

Ms Campbell.
