13. Submissions on Behalf of the UK Statistics Authority by Mr Cohen
===================================================================

**Mr Cohen**: My Lady, I appear for the UK Statistics Authority.

The Authority has been very grateful for the opportunity that you and your team have afforded them to participate in these hearings and to hear what is being said. Every minute of the hearings has been carefully considered, and the Authority remains determined to learn any possible lessons from that which has occurred.

My Lady, a number of themes have been drawn out by the Authority from the evidence that has emerged, and I'm going to comment briefly on them on behalf of the Authority.

The first is that in recent weeks, and indeed this morning, you've heard evidence and submissions by reference to a table which was originally presented in evidence by Professor Sir Ian Diamond, the National Statistician.

The reference for that is INQ000292765, page 10.

My Lady, plainly it is not the role of the Authority to seek to referee any dispute between different core participants as to what the statistical evidence that they have presented means. If anything, my Lady, that's a matter for you. However, I am instructed to offer some observations by way of context in relation to that information.

The first point to make is that those statistics -- which were, as I say, presented in evidence by the National Statistician -- represent the best available information, and the Authority stands by them.

The second point to make is that, to an extent, some of the data in that table has been corrected, because it is based on a standard European population and control mechanisms have been used. Most particularly that means that the age distribution of individuals in a given population has been corrected and, as such, what that data cannot be said to have been skewed by is differences in age distribution in different countries.

The final point to make about that table, my Lady, is that mortality is dependent on a very large number of variables, and indeed, like any statistic, interpreting requires some caution. It may be that, on one view, those statistics tell the Inquiry something about the measures that were put in place in one country versus another, but it is equally possible that other variables in those different countries have had an effect on the results. So some caution is required before interpreting that table as if it were a ranking of different countries.

My Lady, the second point that the Authority wishes to make is about data sharing and data access. A common theme in the evidence that you have heard has been the concern, particularly early in the pandemic, as to data sharing and getting hold of the information that was required.

You may recall, my Lady, that Professor Sir Ian Diamond enlarged on this in evidence, observing "sharing data, or being able to link data together, has the potential to provide evidence to improve the lives of all our fellow citizens in a way that almost nothing else does, and that requires easy, ethical, privacy enhanced data sharing".

My Lady, that is a clarion call on behalf of the data professionals involved in this process, and the ultimate need is to ensure that there are clear and consistent ways in which data can be shared. This might involve systems such as the integrated data service that's currently being developed by the ONS, which involved using trusted research environments to ensure that data can be shared in a way which also commands public confidence, because the Authority is very well aware of the concerns that the public legitimately have at ensuring that their privacy is respected.

My Lady, the third topic that I want to visit briefly on behalf of the Authority is the difficult issue of including information as to ethnicity on death certificates.

My Lady, as Sir Ian Diamond explained, he entirely agrees with the sentiment that it is vital that there is accurate information about the ethnicity of those who have died. You heard evidence, particularly from Ms Badenoch, in which she suggested that she wasn't clear why that wasn't recorded, and it might simply be that it was not something anyone had ever really thought about. My Lady, there's no criticism of the witness for that observation, but in fact it is an issue which has been given the most anxious consideration.

The system is under change: in 2024 and from then on there will be a way of taking the self-identified ethnicity from a person's medical records and including that in mortality data, and the work that you heard evidence about from Professor Nazroo also continues to try and find the best and innovative ways of tracing out ethnicity and mortality and linking them together. But there is a real concern about taking a situation in which a person has died and is unable to say "Actually, no, that is not my ethnicity", and effectively deeming it after they've died to be the case. It's an issue which causes grave concern.

So this is a matter on which work is ongoing. It doesn't necessarily admit to an easy answer, my Lady, and the Authority is anxious that well-meaning recommendations that ethnicity ought to go on death certificates don't open a course which would be unwise.

My Lady, the final theme to visit is really probably the most important single point that the Authority wish to raise, and represents something of a -- well, it's a point that they certainly emphasise greatly.

You heard evidence from a number of witnesses, including Mr Cummings and others, that there was a lack of scientific literacy in Number 10 and in other parts of government, and there were references to the need to bring in external professionals who could provide their expertise on these matters.

The Authority would simply say that it's important not to overlook, whenever a crisis emerges, that the UK Government is already fortunate enough to have very expert individuals in bodies such as the UKSA but also in GO-Science, and, rather than rushing to bring in external individuals, one of the paramount lessons of this experience is the need to ensure that the government's own scientific expertise is used as rapidly as possible and that, for instance, figures such as the National Statistician are involved from the very first to ensure that they are able to give their perspective and to feed into the process.

My Lady, you will receive some additional written submissions from the Authority, but that is all I say on their behalf today, save for acknowledging that they have listened with sorrow and great sympathy to the evidence that you've heard from those who have been directly affected by the Covid pandemic, and they reiterate their sympathy and condolences to each of those individuals.

My Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Cohen, can I press you on one point that you raised, just in relation to the table --

**Mr Cohen**: Yes, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: -- and the number of caveats that you said in relation -- don't use it as rankings, although you also said the Authority stands by the figures.

What would be the best description, a very rough guide? I mean, is there any -- are you in a position to be able to give me any description?

**Mr Cohen**: My Lady, it may be best for us to do this in writing --

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Mr Cohen**: -- because the statistical experts on whose behalf I speak are doubtless all too aware that I am not a statistical expert, and they would want to make sure that what's said is accurate.

**Lady Hallett**: If they could provide, in as laywoman's terms, as best they can, how reliable it would be as any kind of guide, that would be a great help, and explaining what you've explained about the caveats. Because, as you know, some core participants have placed some considerable emphasis on it.

**Mr Cohen**: My Lady, yes.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Cohen. I'm sorry to press you.

Mr Phillips? There you are.
