2. Submissions on Behalf of Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Ms Campbell KC
=====================================================================================================

**Ms Campbell**: The most important duty of government is to protect human life, so said the former Prime Minister to you in his evidence. At the end of this module, my Lady, our clients reasonably challenge the contention that firstly this principle remained at the heart of all government decision-making and, secondly, that enough was done.

You know that those we represent are concerned that the devolved issues in general and Northern Ireland in particular were a mere afterthought on the part of the UK Government. In our oral opening submissions we said that this was significant, as it meant that Northern Ireland did not have a voice in decisions that were of fundamental importance to us. We noted that this was crucial in assessing the extent to which Northern Ireland was hindered in its ability to reach informed decisions, either despite or because of the reliance on the UK Government response.

In this context, it may in fact be the evidence that you haven't heard which speaks the loudest. It is striking that in relation to the big decisions or when considering essential matters for a response, not only were Northern Ireland decision-makers not in the room, but there is no evidence before you of any consideration of the people of Northern Ireland and the context of the north of Ireland in the decisions that were made.

By way of example, there was no Northern Ireland representative on SAGE at a crucial early stage of the pandemic. You know that, and you've heard it before. The evidence now tells us that scientists from the devolved administrations were only routinely invited from early March, however we also know that there's no evidence of any Northern Irish participation on SAGE until 28 March, or, according to one witness, until early April.

That in itself is a disconnect that requires an explanation, and it may be that you're able to gather further explanation in the course of Module 2C, but one thing does seem clear: there was a remarkable lack of curiosity on SAGE or in the UK Government about why no scientists from the north of Ireland had turned up, had taken up the invitation. There is no query about where the north of Ireland representative was, noting the importance of the decisions for the jurisdiction, and the need for their input, nor did anyone in the UK Government receiving SAGE minutes query why there was no attendance from a scientist from Northern Ireland. There is no concern expressed that scientists from the devolved administrations may add value by identifying important local distinctions which require consideration. There's just silence on this issue.

And of course this was during the period when there were crucial decisions being considered by SAGE that would, at least in part, determine the course of the pandemic response. Advice about whether to take measures at borders, advice about mass gatherings, identification of limited capacity for test and trace. We are told by Professor Sir Chris Whitty and others that the lack of a Northern Irish participant was unfortunate because, when a representative from the devolved administration did attend, this benefitted discussions.

But the very lack of consideration of why there was no one in attendance during this critical period is striking. It just doesn't seem to have entered anyone's thinking, and in any event, there's no mention of any consideration before you in this module.

That absence was significant. The silence speaks volumes. At this crucial part of the pandemic, SAGE, like the UK Government, was taking what appeared to be a particularly Anglo-centric approach. You've heard, for example, about how the warning bells were sounded in the UK Government about failures in test and trace. By mid-February SAGE had identified that capacity for community testing would run out in two to four weeks, and that is in fact what happened. But perhaps more significantly for those that we represent, what you have not seen or heard is anyone identifying that at that time, despite having a significantly lower prevalence of the virus at that stage in the north, Northern Ireland did not even have a full test and trace system in operation. They had a pilot scheme. There's no expression of concern about this, or even mention of it in the early SAGE minutes. There's no evidence of any questions being directed to SAGE by UK Government politicians, by the territorial offices, by civil servants or political advisers, asking whether the position on testing was the same for all the devolved administrations. You heard no testimony for any witness who said "This was a matter of concern to me, I raised it at the highest or indeed at any level". Again, it didn't enter consideration.

Similarly, with respect to NPIs, modelling informed decisions taken and measures implemented. However, it's not clear that there was any modelling done on behalf of the north of Ireland during the pandemic, certainly not on the evidence that you've heard so far. Professor Medley, the co-chair of SPI-M-O, stated to you in evidence:

"The nation I didn't really have [any] involvement with at all is Northern Ireland. I think right at the beginning or early in the epidemic it had been suggested that I had a call with the Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland, but that I don't think ever transpired. So, yeah ... I'm not very proud of that, it didn't happen.

"... I didn't have sight of what Northern Ireland were doing in terms of modelling."

These omissions and this failure to consider devolved issues at all is significant. This Inquiry is concerned with the response of the UK Government at this stage, and one purpose is to ensure that any mistakes made may be avoided in future. In one sense, it may be that the process rather than the outcome is the most significant in order to achieve that goal. It can be accepted, of course, that for an unprecedented and deadly pandemic even for those acting in good faith and professionally, mistakes can be made. What is more important is that processes are adopted that can minimise the scope for such mistakes. As you know, this is reflected, for example, in the requirements of Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights, protecting the right to life, which, as you well know, imposes an obligation of means, not an obligation of results. What is important is that the mechanisms which protect life are in place. For Northern Ireland, during a pandemic of this nature, we submit that this should have meant that decision-making structures were adopted and adapted to take into account and place value on the views of our local representatives, locally elected leaders, to ensure that their concerns could be factored into UK decision-making to ensure that they were properly engaged in a process of consultation and not simply dictated to.

As with SAGE, concerns about the approach of the UK Government arise. You've heard that there was a lack of central government engagement with the devolved administrations, and you know about the move from COBR to the 8.15 meetings, the recommendation of the use of the Joint Ministerial Committee and the fact that no JMCs in fact took place within a relevant period. You know about the communications via Mr Gove. Denying that there were failures in communications, Mr Gove termed it a diminution of contact. In one sense the title matters little. This was an unprecedented pandemic. There was a need for co-ordination across all administrations and the involvement of DA leaders in decisions with relevance to their electorate. Far from a halt or diminution in contact, there should have been a maintenance or increase in regular and systemic and meaningful contact at the highest levels, and the involvement of the DA leaders in decision-making.

This approach was particularly concerning as it appears this lack of engagement was not taken for any public health reason, or any desire to ensure that the best response was taken to the pandemic for the citizens of the devolved nations; rather, the motivation appears to have been starkly political, or, worse still, personal. This was apparent from the read-out of a meeting between the territorial offices and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The Secretary of State Northern Ireland read-out of that call identified a number of reasons why the Secretary of State and his equivalent in Wales and Scotland did not think a weekly meeting with the DAs was necessary. The concern is more about political handling than pandemic response. It is in fact striking from that read-out that there are no concerns identified about the lack of an NI test and trace system, about the legitimate need to look to the south of Ireland's pandemic response, or indeed about any substantive issue in relation to Northern Ireland's pandemic response. The concerns are purely political. The goal is control.

A further justification advanced by the Westminster government for seeking to limit the involvement of the DAs in decision-making is leaks. It's not in fact clear whether this was the case in practice, but even if there were leaks, the question arises: who do leaks pose a problem for? Is this properly a public health reason to exclude those with local knowledge from the decision-making process in a pandemic? Surely, my Lady, not.

The exclusion of the DAs from decision-making for fear of apparent leaks amounts to a prioritisation of political optics over public health considerations and the real need to protect the lives of the citizens in particular of Northern Ireland.

You heard about mixed messaging. Lord Lister, a key adviser to the then Prime Minister, was asked by your counsel what the issues was with Scotland adopting a different approach, as of course they were entitled to do. He identified that one concern was that mixed messages were causing confusion. When pressed, he identified that:

"... there was a strong view from the media side at Number 10 ... that you had to have one simple message that goes to everybody."

We note that this strong view did not emanate from the CSA, the CMO, SAGE or even SPI-B. Rather, the media side at Number 10. That suggests that this was not a decision based on the welfare of the citizens of devolved regions, it was, rather, a political issue. That is a problem in itself.

However, there's a more fundamental problem with that answer and the reasoning underpinning it for those we represent. This was expressed to you very clearly by Catriona Myles in her evidence to you when she said:

"... there's no denying [it] -- [it] doesn't matter what political persuasion you are, we share an island with the Republic of Ireland and ... rules and legislation set out in Westminster didn't really allow for the fact that we had a land border ... that [means] that in some cases ... for example, the Derry and Donegal border, you could have a house on one side of a fence having to abide by one set of rules and legislations and yet the neighbours on the other side of that fence had a completely different set of rules. And then ... you had people that were moving through the two different regions for work purposes, social purposes, et cetera. It got so confusing at times for people, it was very hard for normal people to work out if they were abiding by the rules, [and] which rules they were abiding by."

My Lady, you may reasonably conclude that a one size fits all solution dictated by Westminster to the DAs does not work. In the context of the north of Ireland in particular, this should have been obvious to and factored into Westminster decision-making. In fact, the evidence before you suggests that this basic reality is still today not appreciated by those in power in Westminster.

And of course it's not just ordinary people who were aware of this reality of life in Northern Ireland. This is not just a post hoc concern raised by those we represent. Dr Michael McBride, the Northern Ireland CMO, messaged Chris Whitty, and indeed all of the devolved CMOs on 10 March 2020, to emphasise that what was important to him was not only a UK-wide agreement on time, but also north-south consistency of the island of Ireland. Our concern is that there is no evidence of any significant step taken by those in central government to address this concern, no evidence before you in oral or written testimony. It's not just an afterthought. It doesn't appear to have received significant thought at all.

One demonstration of that is that no more than ten days after that message from Dr McBride to his fellow CMOs, you have evidence that on 20 March 2020, in a phone call between Simon Coveney, the Irish Tánaiste, and the Foreign Secretary, Mr Coveney suggested holding a British-Irish intergovernmental conference involving all administrations, which would be important to ensure that not only north-south issues were discussed but also east-west issues, that five-nation two-island approach that you heard of in Module 1. The Foreign Secretary agreed with Mr Coveney and suggested that it would be chaired by himself or the CDL and said that it was a good idea. Despite this there was no such conference held that month, in March 2020, or the following month or indeed throughout 2020. In fact there is no evidence of whether this received further consideration at all within Westminster beyond the initial acknowledgement that it was a good idea.

Again, the absence of evidence is telling.

My Lady, you have heard with particular reference to Scotland about concerns in Westminster that the DAs would introduce measures sooner than the UK central government or ease restrictions later than central government, purely, it's suggested, for the sake of being different. When that justification is scrutinised, it's apparent that the objections of Westminster were again political.

This is perhaps best exemplified in the witness statement of Boris Johnson. The complaint that he chose to give prominence to, in that no doubt carefully crafted statement which we only received in August 2023, was that Scotland announced limitations on mass gatherings before the UK central government introduced their own restrictions. What is striking about this being used as the most prominent complaint about divergence is that everyone now seems to accept that one aspect of the UK response which should have differed is that limitations on mass gatherings should have been introduced earlier. That is now the position of Sir Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick Vallance, and even Boris Johnson, who, when asked by your counsel whether mass gatherings should have been stopped before the Cheltenham Races or the Liverpool-Atlético Madrid match, he said:

"... with hindsight ... we should perhaps have done that, and I agree with you."

So Mr Johnson's criticism of the Scottish administration is that they sought to impose a public health measure earlier than the United Kingdom Government in circumstances where he now accepts that this step should have been taken earlier and where expert evidence suggests that earlier action saves lives. Criticism of the Scottish administration's decision is not, therefore, consistent with public health concern for the people of Scotland or any of the devolved nations.

Even apart from that example, in the evidence before you, there is no criticism of any divergent step taken by any DA on the basis that it resulted or was likely to result in a worse outcome for their citizens or that it failed to sufficiently protect lives. Not a single line of a witness statement or sentence of oral testimony identifies that as an issue. Those who identified divergence as a problem were concerned with the concept of divergence itself. The concern was political, not protective.

We cite the example of mass gatherings not because it's the most important decision for pandemic response, although it was important and it does have particular consideration for Northern Ireland, to which we will return in our written submissions, but because considering how these decisions were made and why divergence has been so criticised strongly points away from any recommendation being made by this Inquiry that there should have been a single UK approach dictated by central government to the devolved administrations crafted without the benefit of local expertise, implemented without taking into account local distinctions, or indeed the scientific reality including that which existed by the physical separation of the island of Ireland.

Michael Gove agreed in his oral evidence that there were bound to be differences between the DAs and central government in terms of a common approach, and that thoughts to the contrary were unrealistic. We agree, and we suggest that this Inquiry should also agree.

It is perhaps this reality which has caused such difficulty for those who advocate the single UK approach as they struggle to square what is essentially a political view with the geographic and scientific reality. In what could be considered remarkable but at the same time unsurprising, this seems to have resulted in Mr Johnson in his evidence to the Inquiry flip-flopping on what is the best approach to govern relationships between central government and the devolved nations. In his statement -- as I say, signed only in August -- he decidedly advocates the use of a pan-UK Civil Contingencies Act so as to "bind the [UK] together". In his oral evidence he vacillated, offering to Mr Keith:

"... I've got an open mind. I see a lot of my colleagues are against the Civil Contingencies Act. I'm happy to defer to them on that point."

Under questioning on behalf of those whom we represent, Mr Johnson appeared to accept the force in the view that the pandemic response must allow for regional flexibility and divergence, taking into account that Northern Ireland forms part of a separate epidemiological unit, though adding that, with respect to the DAs, the more unified we can be the better.

It seems that my Lady has an example of Mr Johnson flip-flopping in real time, taking one position in his witness statement provided in August, changing his mind under questions from Mr Keith, and finally reaching a position that is not quite clear.

We don't identify this to make any ad hominem attack. The significant point is that it again suggests a lack of proper consideration of how the desire for a consistent UK message delivered by central government is compatible with scientific reality and the fact that different approaches may be necessary in different jurisdictions, a reality that Mr Johnson also appeared to accept.

That conclusion finds further reinforcement from his explanation of why he opposed regular meetings with the DA ministers. In his witness statement he asserted decisively that this would be "optically wrong", it was a deliberate decision because it would give the impression that "the UK were a kind of mini EU of four nations [as if] we were meeting as a 'council' in a federal structure".

It will be apparent to my Lady that this view is not based on the needs of citizens responding to an unprecedented pandemic, rather on political optics. We suggest that this focus was and remains misplaced. Mr Johnson continues in his statement:

"... some will say I should have simply made more of an effort, using all of my powers of persuasion, to get the DAs to stick to the UK line. I disagree."

However, with the characteristic flip-flopping, some call it "trolleying", of which you have heard, he volunteered to Mr Keith in evidence:

"If I had my time again, with hindsight, I think [this is] an area where I would have tried -- even though I was very pushed for time, I would have tried to spend more time with the DAs and really tried to bring them with me."

It's concerning for those that we represent that not only were decisions made in relation to devolved administrations for the wrong reasons in 2020 and 2021, over two years on Mr Johnson has yet to agree with himself about what the correct approach would have been, or should have been.

My Lady, briefly dealing with Partygate. The focus on optics also appears to have affected the government's response to the revelations of parties in Number 10. You heard the heartfelt testimony from Ms Myles, who described how her funny and articulate father would die alone in December 2020 while in Westminster there were Christmas parties.

You know that she and her family are not alone in that pain.

My Lady, you have heard the inadequacy of Mr Johnson's response to that evidence. It was unconvincingly suggested to you and to the public that he could not have stopped the parties, and that a single text message sent in December 2021 demonstrated that he had cared about breaches of the rules by his own administration. What is striking about that message is, again, the concern is optics:

"... we should have thought about how it would look ..."

There is no concern expressed for the relatives of those who died alone, in many cases confused, with enforced separation from their family, denied dignity in death while those making the rules engaged in bring your own booze parties, with suitcases full of purchased alcohol. Nor indeed is there any concern about the devastating impact it would have in public confidence in governance.

A word on hindsight before I conclude. There is an important point to be made about the significance of processes and factors that this Inquiry is considering. One concern for those that we represent is that for many of the big decisions, the evidence at the time identified that the approach was wrong or ill considered, but for some reason this was not properly identified or acted upon. We will return to this in more detail in our written submissions, but there are numerous examples to support that hindsight is no defence: TTI, mass gatherings, asymptomatic transmission, and the appreciation of what was happening in Italy in February and early March 2020.

Hindsight, my Lady, is no defence for the mistakes in relation to many of the key decisions in the pandemic. That is particularly, of course, the case for the second lockdown, when the administration seems to have invented time travel, given that they were making the same mistakes all over again.

We make these points not to criticise those decision-makers who were acting in good faith, but to dispel the notion that these decisions can only be considered flawed in hindsight. That is not supported by the evidence, and we respectfully suggest that this Inquiry should make clear in its findings that hindsight is no excuse and that foresight should have been present.

I'd like to finish, my Lady, with the words of Ms Myles. This Inquiry has an unenviable task and we feel a great responsibility to those we represent who are, as Ms Myles noted, "a group who never thought we would ... come together". She has made clear her concern, which is a shared concern for those we represent. She says:

"We have a shared loss. Unfortunately shared trauma.

"... it would be a travesty if what happened to us and our loved ones was allowed to happen again. So really, the main thing that we want from this Inquiry is accountability and reform.

"... we're not saying that everything went wrong, but we just want the truth -- the truth to be out there, and to know that if and when something like this hits our shores again ... that we will be better prepared, and that there will be nowhere for those in power to hide."

My Lady, we ask this Inquiry to hold and to heed those words until we have the opportunity to welcome you to Belfast in April next year.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Campbell.

Ms Mitchell. I was just looking to see whether it's time to take a break, but it's a bit early. Ms Mitchell.
