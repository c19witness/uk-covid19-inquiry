8. Submissions on Behalf of Save the Children UK, Just for Kids Law and the Children's Rights Alliance for England by Mr Menon KC
=================================================================================================================================

**Mr Menon**: Thank you, my Lady.

In their authoritative critique of "Britain's Battle with Coronavirus", George Arbuthnott and Jonathan Calvert conclude that the handling of the pandemic by Boris Johnson's government was one of Britain's worst ever failures of state and political leadership.

This stark conclusion has been reinforced during the Module 2 hearings, as shocking, at times shameful evidence has been heard on core decision-making. It is inconceivable, we submit, on behalf of the children's rights organisations we represent, Just for Kids Law, the Children's Rights Alliance for England and Save the Children UK, that my Lady will conclude that the government's response to the pandemic was anything other than deficient and dysfunctional in multiple respects.

As a nation, we literally sleepwalked into disaster, as over 230,000 people in the UK have tragically died from Covid. Our record in terms of excess mortality and deaths from Covid relative to population is one of the very worst amongst the world's wealthier nations, notwithstanding Boris Johnson's abject refusal to accept so and the heroic efforts of our grossly underfunded and under-resourced National Health Service.

It is irrefutable that so many deaths could have been prevented had our government acted more decisively, effectively and humanely at various stages of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.

Understandably, the primary focus of Module 2 has been on the lessons that must be learnt if we are to avoid a similarly cataclysmic loss of life in a future pandemic. Nothing that we have raised in the questions we have asked witnesses, or raise now in our closing submissions, is intended to criticise that focus or deviate from it.

However, we trust the Inquiry will agree that, even though children were the least likely of any age group to die from Covid, the overall lasting impact of the pandemic and the government's non-pharmaceutical interventions on children, particularly vulnerable children from lower income backgrounds, was damaging, even devastating, and that this important matter is also worthy of consideration by the Inquiry within its terms of reference.

Secondly, if Module 2 is going to investigate the impact of high level decision-making on the entire population, it would be wrong to ignore the over 14 million children who constitute nearly 25% of the population.

Thirdly, there is no need for the Inquiry to reinvent the wheel. There have been a plethora of published reports and studies that document the disproportionate and adverse impact of the pandemic and the government's NPIs on children. The evidence is unequivocal and uncontentious. Nobody has suggested anything to the contrary.

As to the full extent of harm caused to children, we appreciate that this will be explored in greater detail by the Inquiry in 2025 during a later module on children and education. Nevertheless, my Lady, there are important unchallenged points that can properly be made at this stage about children and core decision-making for the purposes of the interim report which we understand the Inquiry intends to publish in 2024.

My Lady will appreciate that there is an urgent need for lessons to be learned quickly as to -- the impact of the pandemic and the government's NPIs continue to be felt by children in terms of, for example, cognitive developmental delays, educational inequality, and increased mental ill health. We urge you not to put children to the back of the queue by delaying all conclusions about children until the later module. We urge you to say as much as you possibly can about children in your interim report, to acknowledge their resilience and sacrifice.

Having made those introductory remarks, we now want to make some general observations about the evidence, then we want to focus on the two key issues that featured most in the evidence in terms of impact on children, namely school closures and social distancing restrictions, whilst acknowledging that children were also impacted by many other issues which the Inquiry has yet to explore, including the reduction in safeguarding protection for children in social care, the terrible conditions that children in custody had to endure, and the failure to classify children's play as exercise.

Finally, we want to make some brief observations about children's rights and their enforceability before concluding.

Turning to the evidence, the fact that children only featured to a limited extent in the 32 days of evidence during Module 2 is indicative of two key points we made in our opening submissions. Firstly, that children are a low political priority in an adult-centric Westminster, and often invisible as far as core decision-making is concerned, and, secondly, that this invisibility was exacerbated during the pandemic.

Indeed, the omission of any mention of children in the Inquiry's original terms of reference drafted by the government, an omission that was only corrected following a public consultation, adds further weight to the concerns of children's rights organisations about how children are often neglected and forgotten by those in power. As does the evidence of Helen MacNamara, the former Deputy Cabinet Secretary, who specifically used the word "invisibility" when describing the government not properly considering the interests of children.

The witnesses who had the most to say about children were Professor David Taylor-Robinson, who gave evidence about childhood health inequality pre-pandemic, the importance of play for children and the impact of isolation on children's development, and Anne Longfield, the former Children's Commissioner for England, who gave evidence about the impact of the government's NPIs during the pandemic on children.

We do not have time now to elaborate on their evidence, but will do so in our written closing submissions. Suffice to say that we trust my Lady will give their compelling evidence the weight it deserves when considering what the decision-makers should have done better.

Another key issue for my Lady will be the extent to which you conclude that the government's response to the pandemic was affected by maverick personalities at the heart of government, including Boris Johnson himself. Whilst we do not discount the pernicious influence of Downing Street's toxic culture and lack of diversity, merely eliminating these problems will not embed the change that is necessary to avoid another deficient and dysfunctional pandemic response. Far greater structural change is needed than that.

Consequently, whilst we recognise that the emails, WhatsApp messages and diary entries provide a unique, contemporaneous insight into what powerful individuals believed privately, as opposed to what they proclaimed publicly, we ask my Lady not to allow this material that has attracted enormous media attention to assume undue importance and distract my Lady from the more fundamental systemic problems that plagued the government's response to the pandemic.

To be blunt, it was the barrel that was rotten and not just the odd apple.

In this regard, the evidence of the key political decision-makers, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, was telling: lots of smoke and mirrors, lots of diplomatic non-answers, lots of blaming others, lots of "I cannot remember". Whilst it's entirely a matter for you, my Lady, we say all four were unconvincing. They gave insincere apologies, they were primarily interested in defending their own reputations, they were quick even when admitting a mistake to fall back on an excuse or qualification that sought to deflect responsibility on to the scientists, or suggest that it is easy to be wise after the fact. It was all so unsatisfactory.

Our focus now will be on Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, as they were particularly relevant as far as children are concerned.

Michael Gove was prone to digressing and answering a totally different question to the one he was asked. On one occasion when he went off on another tangent, Mr Keith understandably got irritated, interrupted him and tried to reign him in. My Lady had to intervene to calm things down.

On another occasion, Mr Gove told Mr Keith that he was concerned that the government did not pay enough attention to the impact on children of some of its measures. However, when I asked him for an example of such a measure, he changed the goalposts and spoke instead of the uncomfortable trade-offs that the government had to make to avoid the NHS being overwhelmed. I also asked Mr Gove who in the Cabinet had primary responsibility to consider the impact of NPIs on children. His answer was everybody was concerned about children.

My Lady, it is not and has never been our contention, regardless of our criticism of government, that nobody in government cared about children. Our criticism is that in the myriad of complex decisions that must inevitably be made during a crisis, it is easy for government to take an adult-centric approach, resulting in children being marginalised. If children are everybody's responsibility, as Mr Gove intimated, they're effectively nobody's priority. That is the problem.

Boris Johnson, although reluctant during his evidence to take responsibility for many of the more glaring mistakes that were made by his government during the pandemic, did make three significant concessions in answer to my questions. Firstly, he confirmed that he had recognised in March 2020, as opposed to with the benefit of hindsight, that school closures were very damaging for children, particularly children from lower income backgrounds, in terms of their development, socialisation, educational attainment, life chances, physical health and psychological wellbeing.

Secondly, he accepted that the government was unprepared in March 2020 for schools to be closed for as long as they were.

Thirdly, he acknowledged that although children have fewer health risks from Covid than adults, particularly older and more vulnerable adults, they suffered disproportionately from the government's NPIs, both in the short and the long term.

Unfortunately, Mr Johnson's government failed to learn the necessary lessons from the first wave of the pandemic and the first lockdown, and the consequences were dire, as we now know, in terms of further waves of infection and death, further lockdowns, and further school closures.

This was perhaps the government's greatest failing.

Finally, no summary of the evidence in respect of children would be complete without a postscript on Rishi Sunak and his evasive evidence about the campaign for free school meals during the holidays, spearheaded by Marcus Rashford. Mr Sunak was keen, when questioned by Mr Keith, to disassociate himself from the entry in Sir Patrick Vallance's diary for 13 June 2021 that Mr Sunak and the Chief Whip had said "Good working people pay for their children to eat and don't want freeloaders".

However, when I asked him what his view in 2020 was on the government funding free school meals, he said he could not recall. When I asked him whether in June 2021 he was opposed to free school meals, he again said he could not recall. And yet it is a matter of public record that in October 2020 Rishi Sunak voted against free school meals during the holidays in the House of Commons, as did Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Michael Gove.

What is perhaps more controversial, we appreciate, of course, is the alleged "freeloader" comment, and whether the Government Chief Scientific Adviser has accurately portrayed in his diary the true sentiments expressed by Mr Sunak on this matter.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm going to stop you there, Mr Menon. This is not an issue that we explored in any great detail. You had permission to ask the questions that you asked, but as far as this module is concerned, I'm afraid I'm going to stop you. This is bordering on becoming party political and I think I've made my position perfectly plain. Could you please move to what is your next point.

**Mr Menon**: I'm moving on.

Turning next to the vexed topic of school closures, I wish to make it clear that we are not advocating a libertarian position that schools should never be closed for most children during a crisis. On the contrary, it is the duty of a responsible government to close schools as a last resort, if such a radical intervention is necessary to save lives. Indeed, given the absence in the UK in March 2020 of any system of mass testing, robust contact tracing and strict isolation of those with Covid, the government had little choice but to close schools as the number of Covid infections and deaths began to raise dramatically. In fact, if schools had been closed a few weeks earlier than they were, it is likely that they could have re-opened earlier, perhaps in May or June, as opposed to in September.

The primary problem in respect of school closures in March 2020 is that there was no proper plan, no clearly established framework, no guidance for schools on remote education, and no arrangements in place for delivering face-to-face education to vulnerable children and the children of key workers under the new social distancing restrictions. And then, to make matters worse, despite the valiant efforts of schools and teachers, the government failed to implement measures that sufficiently mitigated the widespread harm caused to children by the closure of schools and the cancellation of exams.

Instead of schools being the first to re-open after the first lockdown, they were the last to re-open, precedence being given to non-essential retail, hospitality and cultural venues.

Rishi Sunak was plainly wrong when he told the Inquiry that schools re-opened before hospitality. Only certain year groups went back to school in June, before hospitality re-opened in July. Most children only returned to school in September.

If the government had not been reckless after the first lockdown by easing restrictions for economic reasons that inevitably sparked a second wave of infection and death, it is likely that schools would not have had to be closed for a second time in January 2021, thus compounding the enduring harm caused to children.

Even those who might be forgiving of the government for its inaction and complacency in early 2020 on the grounds that Covid was a largely unknown virus would struggle to find any excuse for the failure of the government to learn lessons from the increased scientific knowledge available by the autumn of 2020 and make contingency plans in case schools had to be closed again.

It was an utter shambles when schools opened for a day on 4 January 2021 before closing the very next day for three months, and exams were cancelled for a second year.

It was not just school closures that caused harm to children. The failure of the government to exempt younger children in England from the social distancing restrictions in the summer of 2020, as Scotland did in July for children under 12 and Wales did in September for children under 11, caused additional harm to younger children.

Anne Longfield was calling for younger children to be exempt. Children's rights organisations and child psychologists in England were calling for younger children to be exempt. Yet when I asked Michael Gove, Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson about this, none of them could give a credible answer as to why England followed a more draconian approach towards children in Scotland and Wales.

Furthermore, it was unclear whether any of them even appreciated that the social distancing restrictions in England disproportionately affected younger children, who could not leave their homes unsupervised.

Michael Gove seemed to say it was because the government would have been advised by the CMO, the GCSA or others that children could spread Covid as easily as adults, including asymptomatically, however he could not recall who specifically provided the relevant scientific advice.

Furthermore, whilst claiming to be worried about children transmitting Covid whilst playing outside with their friends, he did not apparently have similar concerns about adults transmitting Covid while hunting, shooting or playing an outdoor sport.

Matt Hancock said that although consideration was given to exempting younger children from the restrictions, the government decided against it because clinicians raised concerns about increased transmission between children from different households playing with each other and between the adults who were supervising the children. When I asked him which clinicians, as the Inquiry has heard no confirmation from a non-politician about such concerns, Mr Hancock said he recalled a conversation with the CMO and a WhatsApp message in which the CMO expressed concerns about parents on the touchline. This will be a matter that my Lady will wish to explore in the future module on children and education, but for present purposes we have been unable to locate any evidence to support Mr Hancock's contention.

Boris Johnson said he would have to look back at the discussions but his instinct was that the government wanted to minimise the risk of transmission. When I pressed him as to why England had taken a divergent approach to Scotland and Wales, he said, "I'm not certain in future we would want to do it that way".

The Inquiry may wish to explore in Modules 2A and 2B whether there is any evidence that Scotland and Wales exempting children from their social distancing restrictions increased the transmission of Covid. We are unaware of any such evidence.

Turning then to children's rights and their enforceability, this is a huge topic which we will develop further in our written closing submissions. The short point we wish to make now is that although children have rights and not just interests under UK and international law, these rights were insufficiently considered by high-level political decision-makers during the pandemic. Consequently many children were deprived of their right to education, their right to play and their right to live free from harm. To recover, they need far more support than they are currently receiving from the state to redress the years of lost learning, lost freedoms and lost hope, and they need the enforceability of their rights to be placed on a statutory footing.

In conclusion, my Lady, we return to the nine recommendations which we set out in our written opening submissions and which we will address in detail in our written closing submissions, but do not repeat now given the time constraints.

The children's rights organisations we represent have given great thought to what fundamental structural changes are necessary for children not to be neglected again in a future crisis. Their recommendations, which we commend to you, my Lady, seek to fix the underlying causes of the mistakes made during the Covid pandemic, as opposed to making blanket recommendations on specific issues that may be irrelevant in a future crisis that is very different from the Covid pandemic.

If followed and implemented, the recommendations will ensure, we submit, that children's rights are embedded in future decision-making, the government fully takes the best interests of children into account, the Covid generation of children is properly supported, and their contribution to overcoming the pandemic is honoured.

We must, as a nation, take decisive action now to prevent a generation of children and young people being defined forever by their experience of the Covid pandemic.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Menon.

As you've acknowledged but I'm going to repeat, I've said it before, I very much intend to ensure that the impact on children is fully investigated. It will be at a different level in this module, but, as you know, later in the Inquiry we'll make sure that they are properly covered.

So thank you.

Ms Davies, oh, there you are.
