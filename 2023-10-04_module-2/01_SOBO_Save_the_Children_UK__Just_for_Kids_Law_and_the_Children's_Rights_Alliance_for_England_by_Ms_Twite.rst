1. Submissions on Behalf of Save the Children UK, Just for Kids Law and the Children's Rights Alliance for England by Ms Twite
===============================================================================================================================

**Ms Twite**: Good morning, my Lady. Can you hear me now?

**Lady Hallett**: I can, thank you.

**Ms Twite**: Thank you.

My Lady, I want to start in 1924, when the League of Nations adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in Geneva. That declaration was drafted by Eglantyne Jebb, who had founded Save the Children Fund in London in 1919 along with her sister Dorothy Buxton, to provide relief to children suffering poverty and starvation following the First World War.

That declaration was drafted in recognition that children have rights that are important and distinct from adults. That declaration later inspired the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, itself a landmark international agreement that enshrines the civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights of children, and has become the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history.

Nearly a century on, Save the Children Fund are now core participants to this Inquiry, along with Just for Kids Law and the Children's Rights Alliance England. And nearly a century on, we must ask this Inquiry again to consider the necessity of children's rights, sadly, we say, so neglected in this pandemic, and ask that you, my Lady, take action when you come to consider your recommendations from this Inquiry.

We know that on the eve of the pandemic the state of children's rights in the UK was bleak. Among almost a third of the more than 14 million children in the UK lived in poverty following a decade of austerity.

We know that following the pandemic that poverty has increased for children, and inequalities have widened, the gap in educational attainment between wealthier and poorer children has increased by 46%.

It is difficult to speak today of anything after the heartbreaking tales we heard yesterday, and we wanted to acknowledge and recognise the huge amount of suffering experienced by those who have died and their families and friends, which included children, as well as those who were directly affected by bereavement and loss. There are also many whose health continues to be impacted by the impact of long Covid.

We recognise that this will be a focus, and rightly so, of this Inquiry. Yet the impact of the pandemic, and the political and administrative decisions which are the subject of this Inquiry too, also touch the lives of millions in many other ways. In particular, we want to emphasise to the Inquiry how children were also negatively impacted and continue to be negatively impacted in a plethora of ways which were unique to them.

Some will carry that negative impact forever, for many they will be the Covid generation. Many were isolated at critical times in their lives. They missed more than just school, they missed chunks of their childhood.

You will, of course, be hearing from witnesses on impact and I cannot hope to do justice to all the different issues that faced children over the course of the pandemic in the 15 minutes I have this morning. But we also say to you that there is no need for this Inquiry to reinvent the wheel when considering the harm done to children in the pandemic.

Since March 2020 there have been numerous reports and studies done by civil society organisations, government bodies, academics, setting out the negative impacts the pandemic and the decision-making had and continue to have on children. This, we say, shows that government decision-making caused educational and psychological harm that in many ways disproportionately impacted children.

In particular we wish to commend What About The Children?, a report written on behalf of the children's rights organisations who are core participants today. This was published last week. We hope that you will read it and give it the consideration it merits.

We also wish to highlight that there have been many other important reports examining the impact of the pandemic, by well over 20 different organisations I don't have time to list now, but we would be happy to provide a list to your Inquiry team.

The UK Government's own website concludes that the quality and quantity of learning students undertook declined as a result of the pandemic. Disadvantage and deprivation appeared to be most associated with less effective learning and overall learning losses, and disadvantaged primary school students were disproportionately behind expectations.

It is, therefore, undeniable, we say, that the pandemic disproportionately impacted children, and we say because the UK Government did not sufficiently consider children's rights and wellbeing in their political and administrative decision-making.

You, my Lady, have already concluded that it is not necessary for the then Secretary of State for Education, Gavin Williamson, to be called during Module 2 hearings and asked about high level decision-making processes, because it appears he was largely excluded from those decisions. This, we say, effectively proves our very point.

Consequently, the key decision in respect of children which the Inquiry will wish to ask itself and ask the witnesses being called are: how does such a serious, inexcusable and avoidable failure of governance and policy making happen? What needs to be done to learn the lessons so this never happens again? And what needs to be done to repair the harm that was caused?

The core proposition that we put forward for the Inquiry to consider is that children's needs are different from adults', and that that difference has to be recognised and embedded in decision-making, and they weren't.

My Lady, to say that children are different from adults is an embarrassingly simple and depressingly obvious submission to have to make, but sadly it is a necessary one. In March 2020, when we were all told to stay at home, we were told we were allowed to go out to exercise. Examples were given in the guidance of jogging and yoga. My Lady, I don't need to tell you that very few young children go jogging or do yoga. But despite frequent calls from those who work with children, from psychologists and academics, to clarify that guidance and tell the population, and tell the police, that play for children would constitute exercise, to tell the parents that supervising their own children whilst their children exercised or played was within the rules, that guidance and those regulations were not updated, and those calls were still being made in 2021.

The result was that parents kept their children in for fear of breaking the rules. The result was that children skateboarding, climbing trees and paddling in streams were told off by the police and sent home.

When adults were allowed to meet one other adult from another household for the jogging and the yoga that they were allowed to do, their young children could not meet any of their friends, because the need for a supervising adult would constitute a breach of the lockdown regulations.

It was, in fact, in the third lockdown, some nine months after that fateful day on 23 March 2020, when you might have thought the government had had time to plan for children, when children were actually the most isolated, because it was in that lockdown that the combination of school closures and the rules against household mixing meant that most children only saw their siblings, if they were lucky enough to have them, and that therefore many children went over two and a half months without seeing another child.

During this time a number of parents provided their concerns as part of a joint letter written by charities to the Prime Minister pleading for a change in the rules. Some of those comments are as follows.

"My 5-year old daughter is an only child and she has been badly affected by lack of socialising with other children since lockdown. She is far less cheerful and motivated than she was before this isolation. She especially looks for video games with other children to watch or pretend, which she used not to do. Her sleep has also become disturbed."

Another mother wrote how her 8-year-old child, also an only child, had become irritable, sad, prone to outbursts of crying and then bedwetting.

A different parent wrote:

"My happy, sociable 7-year old has developed chronic anxiety since the start of this, and all he wants to see is his friends, to race around the playground non-stop and for life to feel normal."

"My 7-year old hasn't seen anyone since December 16th. He has started to withdraw and become moody and aggressive. He is angry with me and his mam because he is an only child and has no-one to play with. I am so worried about him it's unreal."

And finally:

"I have an 8-year-old who, like yours, hasn't seen any other children since mid-December. He sits having literal conversations with himself about football, not just talking out loud but having a discussion, in lieu of being able to chat to his friends."

Like so many aspects of the pandemic, this impact was not uniform. It was exacerbated in deprived areas. A project worker in an area of high deprivation in Bristol described their concerns at seeing the children there:

"Over the last two weeks we've been at school and met parents one by one, handing over art packs we bought for children at home. Unlike the more affluent area where we live, which is busy with children and parents outside, we saw no children at all outside or in green spaces. Parents said that collecting the art pack was the one valid reason they could take their children out, as if they did not feel this was the case otherwise."

But, my Lady, what makes these stories particularly heartbreaking was that whilst this was the experience in early 2021 for so many children in England, at the same time children in Scotland and Wales could meet up and were spending time with their friends. According to BBC News, Scottish children were going sledding and having snowball fights. Because while Scotland and Wales were still in lockdown, they had amended their rules for children.

Not only did this and many other examples, some of which are set out in more detail in our written submissions, mean that lockdown rules were, in reality, stricter for children than their parents, stricter for English and Northern Irish children than Scottish and Welsh, but the impact on children was different. Children experience time differently. Two and a half months for an 8-year old is not the same as two and a half months for a 30-year old. Childhood is a crucial development time which impacts all of later life.

It is why, for some, Mr Johnson's being ambushed by a birthday cake in lockdown touched a particular nerve. It reminded us all of the birthday parties missed by the nation's children. There is something about missing your sixth birthday which frankly isn't the same as missing your 57th. Childhood is sacrosanct and lost childhood cannot be given back.

This is not merely rhetoric, my Lady, we know from the expert report of David Taylor-Robinson, who will give evidence to you later this week, that there are important developmental stages in childhood and that some of these, once missed, cannot be simply returned or caught back up on, and it is that difference that we ask you, the Inquiry, to consider. It is for these reasons that we say some of that impact evidence is vital for your considerations. We ask the Inquiry to consider it and we ask the Inquiry to ask whether those in government considered it when they made the important decisions.

So we ask the Inquiry to start by recognising the distinct needs for children, and then we ask the Inquiry to ask whether the government considered those needs.

To do that, we ask you look both at how those decisions were made. Did they carry out any impact assessments for children? Were modelling and analysis done about different rules for children? Were children mentioned in their discussions?

But also the sort of decisions that they made. In addition to the ones I've mentioned, we had the decision in June 2020 to open non-essential retail, but not most schools. We then had the decision in July 2020 to open pubs, hairdressers, theme parks, but not most schools.

It is not just about whether those decisions were correct, although of course that is also important. It is about how they were made. Why did Scotland and Wales take different approaches? Was it perhaps related to the child's rights impact assessments that those governments carried out on children? Assessments that referenced children's rights that are enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Were assessments carried out by the UK Government? Did the UK scientists, policy makers and politicians analyse the situation in Scotland and decide that there was a good reason for having different rules for children in England?

We focus on how those decisions were made because you might consider that any decision-maker might make the wrong call sometimes, but we are scared they didn't even ask the right questions.

Finally, my Lady, if you agree with us that the questions weren't asked, we ask you to consider why not. Because, importantly, we fear that the answer does not simply lie in the erratic decision-making and the failures of Mr Johnson or the distractions of Brexit, some of which we heard about yesterday, although we accept those are unlikely to have helped. We ask you to imagine what would have happened if we had had Cabinet meetings that did involve better debate, and whether or not thought had gone into considering the social implications of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Would that have resulted in children being properly considered? Because we say this is not just about the individuals, it is about systemic failings within the system.

We say that because even in that scenario, even if we had had non-erratic decision-making, we still don't know the answer to a fundamental question that we pose: whose role was it to consider the interests of children and make sure that their needs were not forgotten in a crisis? We know from the disclosure that Playing Out wrote to the children's minister and Undersecretary of State because they were seriously concerned about the rules about children playing out of doors. He wrote back to say that outdoor play was not in his remit, because the children's minister role sits in the Department of Education. We know that Gavin Williamson was so incidental to decision-making that it is the current position of this Inquiry not even to call him to give evidence in this module.

So who was there to consider the rights for children in England, and perhaps more importantly, who should have been there?

We ask you to consider not just whether there is someone making the decision but how that decision should be made. Some of the evidence we will hear examines the need for diversity of people in the room. For example, Alex Thomas from the Institute for Government expresses concern that the circle of advisers in Number 10 was not diverse, which led to a narrowness of experiences, and we hear from other witnesses about the advantages of diverse groups of scientists that may have led to the changes for parents of young children to be able to meet up with each other.

But there is a fundamental problem here when you consider the importance of diverse groups. A laudable aim, we accept, but however diverse your group, it is unlikely to include children. And that is why, coming back to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, that that enshrines the right for children to be heard, because children are not routinely heard, they are not and are never going to be members of SPI-B or the Cabinet. And however much adults think that they know the interests of children, no one knows that as much as children themselves, and so it is all the more important that that right to be heard is given to children. And it is why we call for specific impact assessments for children. It is why they need a distinct set of rights such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, that is used and embedded in the decision-making processes.

My Lady, in our written submissions --

**Lady Hallett**: I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to wind up now.

**Ms Twite**: I am, my Lady, I apologise for the matter. I am making concluding remarks, thank you.

My Lady, I'm not reading out and wasn't intending to read out the recommendations that we ask the Inquiry to consider in our written submissions. What I did want to say is that we accept that it may seem to be jumping the gun to start this Inquiry with already putting forward recommendations, but we do so in the hope of being helpful, we do so because we hope that this will allow the Inquiry to test whether or not those sort of solutions are the ones that could have made matters better in the pandemic.

My Lady, you have our written submissions where they are set out in full. They are, in brief, arguing for three things: to support the Covid generation to thrive and honouring children's contributions to overcoming the pandemic; to ensure the government fully takes children's rights and best interests into account before and during future crises; and thirdly, to ensure that children's rights are embedded in decision-making.

On the last one, my Lady, this is quite a general proposal.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm sorry, Ms Twite, we're going to have to bring it to an end. It's not fair on everybody else, I'm really sorry.

**Ms Twite**: I'm grateful, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: I have read your written submissions and I will read them again, I promise.

**Ms Twite**: Thank you very much.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.
