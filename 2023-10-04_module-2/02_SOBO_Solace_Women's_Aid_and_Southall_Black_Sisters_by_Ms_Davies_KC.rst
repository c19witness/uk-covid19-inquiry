2. Submissions on Behalf of Solace Women's Aid and Southall Black Sisters by Ms Davies KC
==========================================================================================

**Ms Davies**: My Lady, thank you very much. I appear for Southall Black Sisters, SBS we call them, and Solace Women's Aid, together with Marina Sergides, Fatima Jichi and Angharad Monk, and we are instructed by Public Interest Law Centre.

My clients want to start by paying tribute to the pain experienced by the bereaved families and to their courage in speaking out and articulating their pain and grief. We heard powerful voices yesterday.

My clients have been providing direct services for women experiencing domestic abuse for over 40 years, and they are significant voices advocating for those women's rights. SBS is also a leading, by and for, provider of services for black and ethnic minority women, and has a specific project for migrant women. Both organisations have submitted witness statements, Solace from its head of partnership and public affairs, Rebecca Goshawk, who will give oral evidence before you on Friday, and SBS from its head of policy, campaigns and research, Hannana Siddiqui.

My Lady, there were many consequences of Covid and of the government's response. One of those consequences was a rise in domestic abuse as a result of isolation rules and lockdown. We say that rise was both well known and obvious. It was known from research into other disasters, and from media reports from countries who had entered lockdown earlier than the UK. And it was obvious and, we say, a matter of common sense because individuals were trapped together in the same home.

Although government did not anticipate that rise, a number of prominent politicians and the police did, and shortly before lockdown, on 19 March, both the Domestic Abuse and the Victims Commissioners wrote to respectively the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister raising concerns.

When we refer to an inevitable rise in domestic abuse, we don't just mean that more people would experience domestic abuse for the first time, we also mean that the frequency of domestic abuse incidents increases and that the severity of that abuse increases. So women were and still are presenting to the violence against women and girls sector with more complex needs and with more trauma. Those effects of lockdown continue right up to the present day and we anticipate into the future.

My Lady, I need to deal with language. Domestic abuse is experienced by men as well as by women. But twice as many women than men experience it. Women are more likely to endure repeated domestic abuse and they are more likely to be seriously hurt, and for that reason my clients and their representatives say "women", or "women and girls", to refer to victims and survivors of domestic abuse, because we emphasise the gender dimension, and we take an intersectional approach, recognising that women's experience of abuse and misogyny can be exacerbated when they also face discrimination because of other characteristics such as race, sexuality, gender identity, disability or age.

At the same time as domestic abuse increased, women seeking help found that options normally available to them had significantly diminished. First, they did not always know that they could leave home. The regulations permitted people to leave in order to access critical public services or to escape a risk of harm, so clearly someone seeking to leave because of domestic abuse fell within that, but that message was not clearly delivered by government.

Second, many existing sources of support closed down completely or were difficult to access without placing oneself in danger. A woman experiencing domestic abuse was no longer engaging with people outside her household, such as work colleagues, friends or professional services. Finding the time and privacy to obtain advice from home in the same space as the abuser was challenging.

Yvette Cooper MP made the point in Parliament. She said:

"The social worker is not dropping by, the bruises will not be visible at the school gate the next morning, and the GP will not be asking questions at the next appointment."

Family and friends were not around, women were not meeting their best friends, their sisters, their mother for a coffee or a play date, so those best friends or mother or sister could not do what friends and family normally do, which is offer a spare room or a sofa as the temporary respite where a woman, perhaps with her children, could stay in a safe space, to gather her thoughts, take a breath, make some decisions. Staying with another household, even with your mother or sister, was not permitted. And I've not even addressed the additional and obvious complications of trying to find support in a safe space with children.

Migrant women, particularly those who have no recourse to public funds, NRPF, attached to their leave to remain are in an even worse position. They face what is known as immigration abuse. Not only are they trapped because of domestic abuse and during the pandemic because of lockdown, they are also fearful and their abuser often threatens them with being reported to the Home Office for breach of immigration conditions. So they fear that leaving abuse risks deportation. Their abuser is usually their sponsor, so if they leave they also face destitution.

There is provision for women fleeing domestic abuse to apply for indefinite leave to remain, and for them to be eligible for public funds for three months while their application is considered, but that is only available to women on a spousal or partner visa, so not for women here on student visas, work visas or other family relationships. So while women experiencing domestic abuse were facing a double threat of domestic abuse and coronavirus, migrant women, particularly those subject to NRPF, were living through the triple threat of domestic abuse, coronavirus and fear of destitution and deportation.

We do not suggest that self-isolation regulations or lockdown were unnecessary, nor do we suggest that government could have entirely prevented domestic abuse rising during lockdown, but we do say that the inevitable increase was far from government's mind when considering NPIs, that government failed to plan for that rise, and failed to put in place remedial measures in advance of lockdown. Government failed to consult the violence against women and girls sector, who would have told them what was needed. Government failed to provide clear and consistent public messaging, and it failed to resource the violence against women and girls sector, who experienced unprecedented demands for their services, and it failed to learn any lessons from the first lockdown, so that those failings continued into second lockdown and beyond. And we add that planning to tackle domestic abuse is a legal obligation on government and other public authorities under the section 149 public sector equality duty.

My Lady, as the UK approached lockdown, violence against women and girls services and public services were already significantly underfunded following ten years of austerity. Your expert on gender, Dr Clare Wenham, makes the point that between 2010 and 2020, demand for services from the violence against women and girls sector had increased while funding had significantly decreased, and that demand was about to rocket.

The first lockdown message was the Prime Minister's address to the nation on the evening of 23 March. He said:

"... people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes:

"- shopping ...

"- one form of exercise a day ...

"- any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person; and.

"- traveling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary ...

"That's all [he said] - these are the only reasons you should leave your home."

And, my Lady, you will immediately see that this does not convey to someone experiencing or anticipating abuse at home that she can leave.

A few days after 23 March the Home Office did start, too late we say, to take some steps. The Home Secretary wrote an article in the Mail on Sunday on 28 March which was headlined, "Priti Patel pledges to help vulnerable people stuck at home with domestic abusers during the lockdown", and on 11 April, two and a half weeks into lockdown, the Home Office launched its "You Are Not Alone" campaign. But even then there was no increase in resources to the violence against women and girls sector, so the sector was forced to lobby for more resources at a time when it was experiencing unprecedented demand for its services. There were private meetings with the Home Office, there were open letters, there was press coverage, and my clients were even forced to resort to a threat of legal action.

The most devastating contemporaneous account of government failure is in the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee report which was published on 27 April on the Home Office's preparedness for Covid-19, Domestic abuse and risks of harm within the home. It found that government had not been prepared, that an action plan was needed immediately, during lockdown and after it, and services for domestic abuse and vulnerable children needed urgent and direct funding. And it was only then, on 2 May, after the public campaign, political criticism and the threat of legal action, that resources of Â£76 million were announced for the sector.

At the same time the Mayor of London, not central government, stepped up to fund a crisis project in London, offering 70 emergency refuge spaces run by my clients. And there is a dispute that will be explored in evidence about whether earlier funding for the charitable sector reached the violence against women and girls sector.

We note the irony that during this period the Home Office was steering the Domestic Abuse Bill now the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 through Parliament. Overall we expect the evidence to show that the Home Office's response and that of government generally was too little, too late, and that government was not consistent in its messaging.

That lack of clarity in messaging is best illustrated by noting that the Prime Minister throughout the whole of 2020, while announcing various lockdowns, tiers, and the different regulations for Christmas, which is of course a time when there is traditionally a spike in domestic abuse, did not once mention domestic abuse as a permitted reason to leave home. His first mention of it came on 4 January 2021 when he announced the third lockdown.

When it comes to migrant women, government did not just fail to act, it took a positive decision not to help. Government was extensively lobbied not just by the violence against women and girls sector but also by the Local Government Association, the Mayor of London, various MPs, to suspend the NRPF condition and extend the destitution domestic violence concession for the duration of the pandemic. That step would have been a humanitarian and public health focused approach, similar to the government's "Everyone In" scheme for rough sleepers. Instead, government took a decision not to extend any more protection to women subject to NRPF fleeing domestic abuse. The government's position was put by the Minister for Safeguarding in the House of Commons. She said:

"... lifting restrictions for all migrant victims would enable any migrant, including those here illegally, to ... [secure leave to remain] if they claimed to be a victim of domestic abuse."

We say that this refusal to help continued to trap women subject to NRPF in the homes of their abusers.

My Lady, my final section is on the reality of life under lockdown for women victims of domestic abuse. That reality can partly be gleaned from the statistics contained in the witness statement on the increase in demand for my clients' services. In March 2020 in anticipation of lockdown calls to Solace's advice line were up by a staggering 117% in comparison with the previous year, and in September 2020 up by 138%.

For SBS, in the three months of April to June 2020, their enquiries rose by 138% from the previous year, and over the two years of the pandemic between March 2020 and March 2022 the rate of annual enquiries that they have received has more than tripled. Those are compelling figures and there are similar figures from other organisations in the witness statements.

But even more compelling are the personal stories which appear in the witness statements, and some of the reports before you. Can I give you just three examples.

A woman interviewed by Solace said:

"They [the perpetrator] are not going to the gym, they're not going to work, nothing, so essentially they will use whoever is there at home as their punchbag."

Rachel, a pseudonym, in Siddiqui's statement, had been abused by her husband and threatened by her stepchildren, and said:

"For months I was so isolated, everything was closed because of Covid and I was in the worst state ever. I did not know who to speak to or where to go to get help. I could not contact my GP as the appointments were shut. I did not have any friends that I could talk to. I felt so trapped. The strict Covid rules made it difficult for me to go out of my house or reach out to anyone."

And Joy, also a pseudonym, in Siddiqui's statement, was abused by her partner. She was too scared to call the police as she feared she would be deported. When her partner kicked her out of her home, she was sleeping rough until she managed to contact SBS.

So in conclusion, my Lady, we expect the evidence to show this:

One, that government failed to recognise in advance that a rise in domestic abuse was an impact of isolation rules and lockdown, failed to plan for additional resources to an already underfunded and overstretched sector, and failed to consult the violence against women and girls sector to establish what was needed.

Two, government failed to recognise the specific needs of by and for services for marginalised women facing domestic abuse, black and ethnic minority women, LGBTQ+ services.

Three, government failed to treat violence against women and girls frontline workers as key workers, when that is exactly what they are, providing necessary public services.

Four, government failed to provide clear messages consistently replicated across government, and so failed to give women the reassurance they needed that leaving was permitted.

Five, government took a deliberate decision not to suspend NRPF or take other steps to support migrant women during the pandemic, leaving those women in the triple bind of lockdown, domestic abuse and fear of destitution and deportation.

Sixth, after the first lockdown, from summer 2020, government failed to learn the lessons from the first lockdown so that inconsistent messaging and pressure on resources continued.

My Lady, the lessons from lockdown are well summed up, not only in the witness statements, but in Solace's publication in March 2021 examining the effects of lockdown which is aptly titled "When I needed you to protect me, you gave him more powers instead". We say that is exactly what happened: that government failed to recognise that for many women and girls home is not a safe place and that lockdown made an unsafe home even more dangerous. We hope that the outcome of this Inquiry will be that government prioritises tackling domestic abuse and working with the violence against women and girls sector, both in normal times and in times of pandemic so that when, as you have said, my Lady, we face the next pandemic, women and girls are not doubly or triply at risk.

Thank you very much, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Davies.

Mr Jacobs.
