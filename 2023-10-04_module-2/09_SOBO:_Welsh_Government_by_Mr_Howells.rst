9. Submissions on Behalf of the Welsh Government by Mr Howells
===============================================================

**Mr Howells**: My Lord, on behalf of the Welsh Government, may I begin by quoting the First Minister of Wales in his statement in this module:

"The pandemic touched the lives of everyone: my own, my colleagues, our communities, but none more so that the many families who lost loved ones. I want to acknowledge this loss ... and take this opportunity to express my personal sympathies and sincere condolences, to those affected, and to all who sadly lost loved ones across the nations. The pain and sadness of their losses will last a lifetime and I will continue to recognise this at every opportunity. Sadly, too many families have lost loved ones. This cruel virus has stolen lives and it has left their loved ones with questions, which they rightly want answered. I would also like to take an opportunity to recognise the suffering of those who continue to live with the debilitating after-effects of the virus. We continue to learn not only of the impacts on our health but on our society as a whole. I, and the Welsh Government, are committed and will remain committed to this Inquiry and to learn lessons for the future."

As the Inquiry recognises, an important part of examining the effectiveness of the UK Government's response is to examine how it conducted inter-governmental relations with the devolved governments. The Welsh Government made decisions it considered were in the best interests of the people of Wales. Of course it considered what was being done elsewhere across the UK, but its primary objective was to make the right decisions for the people of Wales based on the scientific and medical advice for the circumstances that prevailed in Wales, which differed to what was happening in the rest of the UK.

The actions of the devolved governments should not be judged by ascertaining what the UK Government did first and then asking why the devolved governments diverged. Decision-making in Wales was undertaken in accordance with its legal responsibilities.

The Welsh Government is reassured by my Lady's statement that there is an obvious value in assessing decision-making across the four nations and the interactions between them. The Welsh Government in particular welcomes the confirmation that your current intention is to publish one report which considers the decision-making in all four governments, having considered the evidence in Modules 2, 2A, 2B, and 2C.

The First Minister has provided two statements for Module 2 which he hopes will assist and inform the Inquiry's investigation. Mr Drakeford would also like to repeat in public his offer to give oral evidence in this module so that his perspective as head of government can be heard and, importantly, examined.

The Welsh Government knows that the Inquiry's investigation will follow the evidence. That is why, given the matters that will be examined in Module 2, and how modern UK is governed, we hope that you will keep under review the decision not to call evidence from the heads of devolved governments in this module. They will provide an invaluable perspective on core decision-making in the UK, without which there is a risk that the full and complex picture of governance will not be heard and an opportunity for much needed reform will be lost.

The Welsh Government invites your Ladyship to consider three particular issues: firstly, the nature and effectiveness of the UK Government's dealings with the Welsh Government in relation to non-pharmaceutical interventions; secondly, the funding arrangements governing the response to health emergencies between the Treasury and the devolved governments; and thirdly, the benefits of effective devolved decision-making.

Those issues have been addressed in our written submissions but I wish to focus on a few key points this morning.

Firstly, the decision-making structures.

Until May 2020 the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson engaged with the First Ministers of the devolved governments via COBR. It can be seen from the minutes of COBR that all four governments were alive to the benefits of a common approach, but they were also alive to the reality that the pace and implementation would be different in each country depending on the scientific and medical advice upon which decisions had to be based.

However, in May 2020 the UK Government decided unilaterally to reorganise its Cabinet committee structures. It ceased holding COBR meetings. Instead it implemented Covid-S, strategy, and Covid-O, operations, to reflect the structures which had been adopted as part of the Brexit preparations. When that change was made, Mr Johnson accepted a recommendation that COBR was to be replaced with the Joint Ministerial Committee meetings, to ensure that the Prime Minister met the First Ministers. This was a decision-making structure used to good effect as part of the Brexit preparations.

Mr Johnson did not attend a single Joint Ministerial Committee meeting with the First Ministers. Until COBR was re-engaged in October 2020, when the circumstances across the UK were deteriorating badly, he did not meet them once. Boris Johnson's reason for not meeting the First Ministers was his belief that, to avoid the impression that the UK was a federal state, he should not be seen to be doing so. His concern with appearances did not recognise and so did not meet the scale of the events confronting the four nations. As a reflection of the UK Government's attitude to close and effective co-ordination between the four governments, this evidence is telling.

The First Minister regularly asked for regular meetings with the Prime Minister to discuss the path out of lockdown and then to discuss circuit breakers. Those requests were ignored. The UK ministers and former UK ministers that the Inquiry will hear from seek to highlight the importance of consistent decision-making across the UK. However, the reality is that the UK Government made consistency difficult to achieve in practice, because it failed to support the means which might have secured those ends.

The second main point is the funding of a health emergency. The First Ministers dealt very clearly with the barriers that were created by the Treasury to the devolved governments implementing restrictions they considered necessary on the scientific and medical advice available to them. The length of the firebreak in Wales was influenced by the refusal of Mr Sunak to bring forward the enhanced job support scheme, which came into force on 1 November 2020, in time for the lockdown in England.

The effect is powerfully explained by the First Minister in his statement:

"On 23 October 2020, the Welsh Firebreak came into effect. Had we had the confidence that the UK Government would provide the money needed to support people during the firebreak we probably would have implemented the lockdown sooner. However, it was hard for Wales to take the initiative, because that meant we had to take the decision without financial support provided by the UK Government. Nevertheless, I felt strongly that we needed to implement the fire break to delay the spread of the virus, because that was what the science was telling us.

"The Chancellor of the Exchequer refused to fund the consequences of a public health decision taken in Wales. That decision was, in my view, one of the most misguided decisions of the whole pandemic. It demonstrated that the four nations of the UK were to be treated differently by HM Treasury. It was, in effect, acting as a Treasury for England, not as a Treasury for the UK. This was vividly illustrated when, within a few days of the Welsh firebreak a similar set of measures were adopted for England. Funds to support that cause of action were then released by the UK Treasury. Those funds extended to Wales, but only because of decisions taken in response to the public health position in England, not because of the public health needs in Wales."

The issue of the availability of financial levers was raised time and again and by the First Ministers, but as of today it remains unresolved.

My Lady, the third main point is the reality and benefits of devolved decision-making. Both Mr Johnson and Mr Gove suggest that in any future response to a health emergency, the UK should be treated as one epidemiological unit and that the UK Government's backstop powers should be strengthened. There are three fundamental problems with that course.

Firstly, both Mr Johnson and Mr Gove accept that the decisions taken by the Welsh Government were reasonable and were based on local circumstances. In particular, they accept the decision to impose the firebreak in Wales ahead of England was reasonable as infections were rising and tiering was not working. That recognition of the effectiveness of devolved decision-making is inconsistent with the call for greater centralised power.

Secondly, the devolved decision-making under health protection legislation was the consequence of the UK Government's own decision not to use UK-wide legislation such as the Civil Contingencies Act or the Coronavirus Act. It is not a proper basis for criticising the devolved settlements that have now existed for nearly a quarter century.

Thirdly, the sectors most affected by the public health emergency, health, education, social care and local government, had been devolved for more than two decades when Covid-19 struck. None of these policy areas have been the responsibility of the UK Government for that length of time, and by 2020 each of them operated under different legislative, policy and funding arrangements from England and the rest of the UK.

The UK Government was not only unfamiliar with those arrangements, but it lacked any practical presence on the ground. It simply lacked the means to implement any decisions which it might make far from where those decisions would have a practical impact. So the idea that the UK Government could swing in and make effective or in some way better decisions for Wales is misconceived.

The Welsh Government looks forward to contributing to and supporting the Inquiry's work. This module provides a unique and valuable opportunity to assess critically but fairly how intergovernmental relationships work and to make recommendations for improvement.

Diolch yn fawr.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

Can I just say this in relation to the point about not calling the First Ministers in Module 2. I do understand the concerns, of course I do, and I know that Mr Drakeford has expressed his concern to the Inquiry team. But can I assure everybody, we will of course be falling the First Ministers in the specific Modules 2A, 2B and 2C, where appropriate, but also I've told the Inquiry team I want to ensure that nothing falls between the cracks, so if there's anything that Mr Drakeford has raised in his witness statements for this module that needs to be put to the UK ministers, they will be put. And similarly, if the UK ministers raise anything, it will be put to Mr Drakeford when we get to 2B. So please rest assured and assure Mr Drakeford and the other First Ministers or former First Ministers that we will ensure that all the matters they are concerned about will be taken into account.

**Mr Howells**: My Lady, I'm grateful.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Ms Drysdale.
