4. Submissions on Behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations by Professor Thomas KC
==============================================================================================================

**Professor Thomas**: My Lady, I appear on behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations, and I'm instructed by Saunders Law.

At the heart of this Inquiry, beneath the layers of documents, data and decisions, lies a deeply human story, one of resilience, adversity and a quest for justice. So, my Lady, I implore you not just to hear but truly listen to the narrative I'm about to give, because it's a testament to those who have given their all in the face of unprecedented challenges.

At the height of the pandemic, do you remember every Thursday evening the nation paused? Streets, usually filled with the hum of daily life, echoed with the sound of applause. We clapped for our carers, we clapped for those putting their lives on the line day in, day out, to keep us safe, to keep our loved ones breathing, to keep our hopes alive.

The initiative wasn't just an expression of gratitude, it was an acknowledgement of the sacrifices being made by our healthcare workers, many of whom hailed from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.

Yet there is an unsettling juxtaposition here. As the echoes of the applause rang out, the evidence was mounting, silently and devastating, of the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 that it was having on our healthcare workers of colour.

A painful irony was unfolding. While we were clapping for all, were all being cared for in return? While our hands came together in appreciation, was there a parallel commitment from our government to ensure that every healthcare worker, irrespective of their racial or ethnic background, was being equally protected?

Sadly, the heartbreaking reality suggests otherwise. The very workers we cheered for, the faces of many of our doctors, nurses and support staff from diverse backgrounds, faced systemic challenges that made them more vulnerable.

How can we reconcile the public's heartfelt gratitude with the alleged indifference or oversight of a system tasked with protecting them?

You see, it's not enough to clap, it's not enough to express gratitude. True appreciation, true respect, lies in addressing the structural disparities that put our healthcare workers of colour at higher risk. We owe them that much. If we are to clap, let us also commit. Let us commit to understanding, to changing, to rectifying.

In our journey for answers, three guiding principles beckon us forward: acknowledgement where there has been ignorance, action in place of inertia, and advocacy in face of silence.

FEHMO invokes those principles.

Three truths stand unwavering: injustice, if left unchallenged, festers; silence in the face of oppression is complicity; and the power to change is vested in those who dare to speak.

FEHMO dares to speak.

This pandemic touched each and every one of us in ways we could never have imagined, but as we shall see, it has not touched us all equally.

Hearing critiques, especially those anchored in historical and systemic biases, can be a challenging and bitter pill to swallow for any institution, including government. This is particularly the case when such critiques target the very foundations upon which an establishment's decisions are based.

For the Westminster government, listening to these narratives from organisations such as FEHMO will inevitably stir feelings of discomfort, defensiveness, and perhaps even disbelief. This discomfort emerges not just from the weight of the criticisms, but also from the realisations of serious failings, of not having adequate safeguards for the most vulnerable, despite having the power and resources to do so.

However, it is precisely in this discomfort that the potential for genuine growth and change resides. By actively listening to and understanding the concerns of organisations such as FEHMO, the government can embark on a journey of introspection and reform. Avoiding or downplaying these narratives would be a disservice not only to the affected communities but also to the nation's commitment to justice, inclusivity and progress.

So let's turn to the government's unpreparedness. The very foundation of good governance is rooted in the ability to anticipate challenges, prepare effectively, and respond decisively. Yet, my Lady, when confronted with the unfolding catastrophe of this pandemic there was an alarming void in strategic planning specifically addressing the needs of/vulnerabilities of many minority communities.

The absence of a structured response targeted to these communities was not just an oversight, it was a glaring omission that stands as a testament to a system ill prepared for the magnitude of the crisis at hand.

Yesterday we heard from your counsel to this Inquiry about the numerous early warning signs and data points that should have prompted a more calibrated response from the government. The information was there indicating the communities most at risk and the mounting challenges they faced, yet there seemed to have been a lack of urgency or tangible action in formulating interventions to protect vulnerable populations.

You see, the failure to consider systemic discrimination and its impact on these communities' resilience to healthcare crises was particularly concerning. The neglect to connect the dots between historical inequalities and present vulnerabilities revealed a significant lapse in holistic understanding and governance. There was a dual failure: a failure to anticipate and a failure to respond. This, indicative of a system that needs drastic re-evaluation and restructuring to truly serve all segments of a society equitably.

My Lady, Module 2 will focus on decisions taken by the highest echelons of power. The Prime Minister, the Cabinet, advisers in the civil service, and a coterie of other advisers. This is crucial because it is an apex of where national strategies are formulated.

However, to understand the present, one must be acutely aware of the past. The UK's history of racial inequities remains imprinted in the very structures of our institutions, thus decisions that emerge from a system, if not consciously evaluated, can perpetuate those very inequalities. It is imperative that the Inquiry in its probing of these decisions recognises and critiques the underlying dynamics that may have either inadvertently or explicitly sidelined the needs of minoritised communities.

I don't need to tell you, my Lady, that structural discrimination is neither new nor unfamiliar. It is deeply entrenched in systems of biases and inequalities that manifest across various facets of society. Black, Asian and other minority ethnic healthcare workers often bear the brunt of this discrimination, facing challenges that range from reduced access to resources, to subtle yet persuasive workplace bias. These systemic disparities compromise not only the wellbeing and professional development of these individuals, but also the overall resilience of our healthcare system.

So what are the facts and the lived experiences of the disproportionate impact on communities of colour? Let me share some of them with you.

65% to 76% of the Covid-related deaths reported in clinical healthcare workers, despite only making up 20% of the NHS workforce.

On 10 April 2020, less than three weeks after the national lockdown was declared, the British Medical Association warned that the first ten NHS doctors to die from the virus were from black, Asian or from minority ethnic backgrounds. The numbers are alarmingly shocking and speak for themselves. The disproportionate impact of Covid on communities of colour is not just statistical, it is deeply human.

High infection and mortality rates, coupled with limited access to timely medical care, underscored a troubling reality, for these communities pre-existing health conditions, socio-economic challenges and limited access to resources created the perfect storm, amplifying the ravages of the virus.

But it is essential to recognise that this isn't about biology, but about a system that has historically marginalised certain communities, making them more vulnerable to healthcare crises. Accordingly, it's imperative to first acknowledge a fundamental observation: Covid-19 did not create health inequalities. Instead, the pandemic unmasked and accentuated long-standing disparities that have plagued black, Asian and minority ethnic people and groups within the UK.

While recommendations were made for more culturally appropriate occupational risk assessment tools, the realtime implementation of such tools was inconsistent at best, leaving a significant proportion of our healthcare workers exposed and vulnerable.

A decision of note was the downgrading of the Covid-19 from a high-consequence infectious disease status, which dictated the type of protective equipment that would be used. This decision, we say, contradicted robust scientific evidence at the time and adversely impacted on the safety of FEHMO members. Whilst some initiatives were launched, such as the FFP3 fit testing project aimed at accommodating diverse facial profiles, they lacked urgency, were inconsistently implemented across healthcare settings.

Meanwhile, the very essence of public health communications during this period lacked accessibility. For many, my Lady, the language of guidance was exclusively in English, erecting barriers in accessing crucial information.

FEHMO members, along with other organisations, rose to the challenge to bridge this communication gap, ensuring that public health messages reached communities in need. In the midst of a crisis, FEHMO's members continued to educate, raise awareness and engage at all levels of governance and administration. Their objective: to highlight very real and often overlooked challenges such as inadequate PPE and heightened exposure to risk faced by ethnic minority healthcare workers.

The question then arises: were these issues given due consideration as part of the public sector equality duty under the Equality Act 2010? Our collective responsibility is to probe and ascertain if there were a suspension, even inadvertently, of the fundamental statutory obligation towards the elimination of discrimination.

So let me come to the end. By critically examining the impact of structural racism on decision-making by acknowledging the missteps and oversights rooted in systemic biases, this Inquiry can foster greater understanding of how these structures adversely impacted our society. For the sake of our shared future, we must ensure that lessons learned from this crisis are deeply embedded in the national consciousness and structural governance. It's not just a question of human rights, but of public health and trust. It's incumbent on all of us to confront these difficult truths of structural racism and health inequality and their reflection in decision-making.

My Lady, James Baldwin once said not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.

You see, this quote encapsulates the essence of our dialogue today. It underscores the urgency, the necessity of confronting hard truths regardless of the discomfort as a precursor to meaningful change. Baldwin's wisdom compels us to be brave, to acknowledge the shortcomings and to relentlessly pursue a future imbued with hope and justice.

I end, my Lady, with this, with words from one of FEHMO's members. When asked in conversation with the legal team what, if anything, they think was done adequately and what could have been done better during the pandemic, they said this:

"Very honestly, it was too little, too late. From an institutional point of view, I'm afraid to say, not enough was done. There was a lack of understanding of the risks faced by vulnerable groups. To put it mildly, I would say it was a lack of awareness or ignorance. Being more blunt, it was apathy and indifference. Without mincing words, systemic racism and institutional discrimination at the heart of structures. Part of it, and it's only an answer, but some of it having representative and leadership at senior levels. At the start of the pandemic there was little diversity of thinking, background and perspective in decision-makers. They were very removed from those on the ground facing the impacts. Being able to understand the extra risks faced by vulnerable people is very important. This must be built in when making pathways and plans. Also to think about people and value them. Their lives were worth safeguarding. People felt like tools that were being used, not lives that were being valued."

Thank you.
