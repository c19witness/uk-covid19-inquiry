6. Submissions on Behalf of the Department of Health Northern Ireland by Ms Murnaghan KC
========================================================================================

**Ms Murnaghan**: Good morning, my Lady. I make this closing statement on behalf of the Northern Ireland Department for Health, which I'll refer to as "the department".

My Lady, the purpose of this closing statement is to assist the Inquiry in respect of nine identified issues, which we feel may require further clarification as a result of the evidence which has been given during these hearings.

The first of those issues, my Lady, is that of the updating of the 1967 Public Health Act, and, firstly, the department would like to emphasise that the proposal to pause work on updating the 1967 Public Health Act was made in the context of other priorities and pressures at that time.

The updating work had been initially intended to broaden the scope of the Act from having a primary focus on infectious diseases to an all-hazards approach.

My Lady will see, of course, that from the contemporaneous emails of Professor Sir Michael McBride that this agreement was only reluctantly given, in light of the more immediate priorities at that particular juncture. Indeed, the subsequent collapse of the Executive would have prevented further work and progress on this in any event.

Notwithstanding the decision to pause that work, significant work had been taken forward in Northern Ireland during 2018 and 2019 to develop Northern Ireland clauses for inclusion in a draft UK pandemic flu Bill. This work sought to address the gaps that had been identified in the Northern Ireland's 1967 Public Health Act, and indeed this work was extensively drawn upon when the -- and informed the making of the 2020 Coronavirus Act.

It is also of course the case that, contrary to the evidence that was given to the Inquiry by Mr Aidan Dawson on behalf of the Northern Ireland Public Health Agency, that amendments to the list of notifiable diseases could be made at any time, and in fact this was the case during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the causative virus was made a notifiable disease.

The department would also like to point out that there has been at times during the hearing the perception that there has been a conflation and confusion in relation to the UK Civil Contingencies Act and the Northern Ireland Public Health Act. Of course these are two separate pieces of primary legislation.

The second issue, my Lady, that we would like to address is that of potential issues which may remain in relation to the department's corporate risk register. Regrettably, the most recent iteration of the department's risk register, which showed the actions completed, had erroneously not been provided to the Inquiry at the point when our witnesses gave their evidence. This oversight, my Lady, has now been remedied and the department would ask that any recommendations made by the Inquiry would refer, of course, to the most recent and relevant iteration of that register.

Further, we would hope that the context and scope of the departmental risk register should be considered. Risk registers are living documents and they comprise identified corporate risks which are considered as having the potential to impact on the department's ability to deliver on its objectives.

The risk register of course does not reflect risks that have actually materialised, but rather represent risks which the department has identified that may happen and the high level actions that the department will take to mitigate the risk of same.

The departmental risk register is reviewed quarterly at three distinct stages, and is also separately considered by the departmental audit and risk assurance committee, who will advise in turn the permanent secretary on the adequacy of the representation of the risk and the actions to manage and mitigate.

At no stage is there any expectation that the minister should review or supervise the risk register. As such, the failure to reiterate risks from the risk register in the minister's first day brief should not be regarded, we say, as a point of criticism, particularly given that the first day brief is extensively elaborated on in the minister's subsequent meetings with the respective policy leads in the first few days and weeks of his appointment.

The third issue, my Lady, we would like to address is that of the perception that there were concerns that the department had not acted on the Bengoa report. Indeed, a ten-year approach to transforming health and social care in Northern Ireland, which was entitled Health and Wellbeing 2026: Delivering Together was launched in October 2016. The Delivering Together project was in response to three significant reports, the first being the Bengoa report, the second the Transforming Your Care report, and the third, of course, being Sir Liam Donaldson's report.

Work began on that project in November 2016, and in the absence of our Northern Irish Assembly, senior departmental officials continued to provide strategic leadership and oversight in the design, development and implementation of the transformation strategy.

In that context, 18 key deliverables were identified for the Delivering Together project, and reports had been published in 2017, May 2019 and June 2021. These 18 actions were all considered as being achieved in as far as possible within the decision-making context and the financial constraints of the time.

Notwithstanding this, of course, it was always acknowledged that full implementation of the transformation strategy required both sustained investment and decisions that would rightly fall within the purview of the ministers.

The fourth issue, my Lady, is that of the impact of single-year bundles. The department would like to clarify that the evidence of the former health minister, Mr Robin Swann, in relation to single-year budgets did not mean that the department was only able to make short-term decisions in relation to healthcare. In the hiatus period the department was able to make some long-term decisions in respect of major capital programmes, amongst which was the establishment of the critical care building at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the introduction of the largest digital project in Northern Ireland, entitled Encompass.

Despite these actions, it is, of course, incontrovertible that the absence of multi-year budgets reduced the certainty with which longer-term planning could take place and created a greater short-term focus than was otherwise desirable.

Of course, my Lady, officials operate under the direction and control of the relevant departmental minister. In Health, both officials and the minister have responsibilities set out in statute in the Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009. In brief compass, these responsibilities are to effect the health and wellbeing of the population and to secure the continuity of health services.

These responsibilities cannot be passive or reactive in nature, but rather must be performed to their full extent to ensure that the public has the protection that they rightly expect and deserve.

The fifth issue that I'd like to discuss, my Lady, is that of departmental structures, and the department would like to address issues which arose in relation to the extensive and complex structures for emergency planning and preparedness in Northern Ireland, and the observation that had been made that these could be seen as overly complex.

While of course the department is open to better ways of organising these arrangements, it is considered that there is no one ideal structure. The department does not consider that there was a fundamental structural problem. Rather, it considered that what mattered more is that of functionality and that those individuals who operate within the extant arrangements understood their respective roles and responsibilities.

In the Northern Ireland context, it is considered that these advisory groups and structures are important, in that they bring together individuals across separate organisations in order to work collectively on aspects of emergency preparedness and planning. These arrangements are, by necessity, complicated and, to the uninitiated, may appear complex. That said, these interactions are considered to be fundamental and necessary to ensure resolved consideration across separate organisations and expert groups.

Furthermore, it is considered that there is a good level of accountability for aspects of health and social care, including emergency preparedness. Planning in Northern Ireland is necessarily delegated to boards of arm's length bodies who are in turn accountable to the department through extant arrangements of departmental sponsorship and mid and end-year accountability reviews.

Accountability within the department means, in practice, that respective directors and departmental group leads will provide assurance to the permanent secretary. These arrangements are long established and well understood.

The sixth issue is that of emergency planning. The Inquiry Counsel at times asserted that the department's emergency response plan was based on outdated and faulty thinking in its focus on pandemic influenza.

The department would like to emphasise that this response, the emergency response plan, was not of itself specific to pandemic influenza or even to pandemics, but rather it was designed to allow an appropriate response to be made to an emergency of any sort which impacted on health and social care, including infectious diseases.

The health service and the department have long-standing and well rehearsed plans to respond to all emergencies, irrespective of the threat or the hazard. As such, this planning and preparation is agnostic as regards to the cause of the hazard, and is designed to ensure an appropriate and proportionate response at all levels. This could range from responding to a local and contained emergency up to and including an emergency which would require cross-government response and triggering of the civil contingency arrangements.

Of course, as the Inquiry has heard over these hearings in recent weeks, it is necessarily preferable to have an approach with flexible capabilities that could be deployed in response to any pandemic. While some of the elements of the UK influenza pandemic plan were beneficial, it clearly had deficiencies in providing a response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Capabilities should be generic enough to allow a response to a range of potential pathogens and modes of transmission, agile enough to be scaled up quickly enough to contain spread, and specific enough, with tailored control measures, when there is a better understanding of the pathogen.

These are all lessons which Northern Ireland and the department can reflect on in future approaches to planning and preparation.

Further, notwithstanding the importance of a general pandemic plan, it is nonetheless considered essential that Northern Ireland would maintain a pandemic plan for influenza, given its continued propensity to cause outbreaks with significant morbidity and mortality.

The seventh issue, my Lady, is that of the reviews that had been carried out via the silver debrief and the gold independent inflight review in the very early stages of the pandemic in Northern Ireland.

In such a high pressurised, fast-moving and dynamic situation, communications are always challenging, and it was in this context that issues were raised about PPE which led to the suggestion that some had failed to appreciate that the emergency PPE stockpile did not form part of the day-to-day supply chain.

In his evidence, Mr Pengelly confirmed that no concerns had been brought to his attention about the management of the emergency stockpile of PPE prior to the pandemic. The PPE stockpile in Northern Ireland was effectively used during the pandemic to supplement and to support the main PPE supply, not only to trusts but also to social care, primary care and emergency dental services during the early response to the pandemic.

The eighth issue I'd like to touch on, my Lady, is that of north-south collaboration. The department's evidence demonstrated the extent of collaboration with its Irish counterparts, but of course it is to be recalled that any formal policy, if it is to encompass a five nation, two-island approach, will be a matter necessarily for the UK and Irish governments, rather than being a matter for the department.

The ninth and final issue, my Lady, is that of whether there should be a chief scientific adviser in Northern Ireland, and we say that this is essentially a matter for the Executive Office. However, the department does wish to point out that Professor Young provided input and advice as required and on a number of areas to the Department of Health. The fact that the Executive did not ask Professor Young for scientific advice from 2015 should not be interpreted as inexorably meaning that Northern Ireland was inadequately served by the provision of scientific advice in a way which detracted from its ability to respond to the challenges posed by this pandemic.

The Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families raised the issue of the limited participation of the department's Chief Scientific Adviser in the UK CSA network. However, it should be noted that the absence of the department's scientific adviser from that network did not mean that the department was unable to access its advice.

It is also the fact that the issue of participation is outwith the scope of those in Northern Ireland and, rather, rests at the discretion of the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser.

Indeed, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the CSA for that department in Northern Ireland acted as the single point of contact for Northern Ireland in the network, and he was able to pass papers to Professor Young.

It is also, we say, apposite to note the scope of what happened at those CSA meetings. They were informal, regular meetings but significantly were not part of central government emergency planning or decision-making or advisory structures, in preparation to or in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Additionally, it should be noted that throughout the pandemic Professor Young attended the UK SAGE meetings and other relevant UK fora. He was able to provide advice to our Chief Medical Officer and the health minister as appropriate. He attended meetings with the Northern Ireland Executive ministers and officials from other departments, participated in communications and briefings to the media, the public and other stakeholders, and established and chaired the department's strategic intelligence group and modelling group.

My Lady, to conclude, the department of course recognises that, with the benefit of experience of the Covid-19 pandemic and its particular challenges, Northern Ireland could have been better prepared. It is also mindful, however, that, without this experience, it was very challenging to be ready to meet every eventuality. In a range of ways, very substantial efforts had been made to ensure that the department was adequately prepared, with many of those involved showing dedication and commitment to achieving the best possible outcomes whilst simultaneously addressing very significant non-pandemic issues facing health and social care in Northern Ireland.

However, insofar as more could have been done, that is a matter of profound regret. The department reiterates its sincere commitment to learning lessons from the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic such that it might mitigate the enduring consequences that continue to be experienced by our health service and our community. To this end, the department hopes that the Inquiry will be able to identify learnings and recommendations to help shape future responses, particularly given the ever-present potential that another pandemic may arise, the exact timing and nature of which will be unknown.

Finally, the department wishes again to convey our deepest sympathies to those bereaved during the course of this pandemic.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much for your help.

Ms Studd.
