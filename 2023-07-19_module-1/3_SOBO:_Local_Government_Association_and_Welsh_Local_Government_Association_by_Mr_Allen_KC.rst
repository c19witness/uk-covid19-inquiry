3. Submissions on Behalf of the Local Government Association and Welsh Local Government Association by Mr Allen KC
==================================================================================================================

**Mr Allen**: My Lady, as you know, I represent the Local Government Association and the Welsh Local Government Association, and both organisations thank you and the Inquiry team for the efficiency and thoroughness of the process to date.

They also thank you and the Inquiry team for the opportunity to participate in this module. They know that you will carefully consider the two chief executives' separate and joint witness statements and the answers given to them and those of Ms Allen, no relation, chief executive of NILGA, in their oral examination on 12 July.

Their teams and I, having listened intently to the examination of other witnesses, are preparing a written closing submission which you will receive in due course, and this will say more than I can in this brief oral closing.

Today, I will focus on the very heart of the association's concerns. I must start by emphasising again the importance of local government in pandemic planning. You will have learnt during this stage of your Inquiry, to the extent that it was not already apparent to you, that to bring a country through the scourge of a pandemic requires multiple efforts across civil society, and that means not just from the NHS, but, as I've already emphasised, from all of the 1 million-plus local government officers across England and Wales.

They have been at the heart of the work by: finding and tracing those actually or potentially affected or particularly vulnerable; stopping the spread of the virus through assisting with quarantine; helping to maintain social distancing; enforcing lockdowns and creating vaccine centres; supporting and caring for those who are particularly frail or vulnerable; providing adult social care; looking after families when schools are closed or they're otherwise in need; and, at death, doing what they can to provide a dignified departure from this world; maintaining as much of ordinary life as possible, including administering business loans to help keep business going, then and later; and, in due course, helping with the process of recovery.

The association's two chief executives have been examined about local government's preparation for these roles. Their engagement with the local resilience fora as Category 1 responders, their engagement with the Cabinet Office and the way in which the Civil Contingencies Act had worked during the Module 1 period.

You have already heard some extraordinary facts, how the planning was focused on a pan flu and ignored the possibility of a respiratory virus pandemic, how there was no preparation for quarantine, social distancing or lockdown, how there was no planning for cross-border working between England and Wales, and how the associations were excluded from full participation in Operation Cygnus and were not even informed of its recommendations until they were disclosed in the autumn of 2020, long after the pandemic had begun, and how Operation Alice was conducted with no engagement with local government.

And, I must add, my clients simply do not understand the evidence of former Secretary of State for Health Mr Hancock, who stated that only two councils had plans for pandemic flu, a suggestion they do not believe to be accurate at all, and, my Lady, we refer you to the survey conducted at the request of the Inquiry team attached to the joint witness statement of the two chief executives, and, similarly, they believe the department had and has far more levers to understand, oversee and to shape social care provision than his evidence suggested.

To find out the extent of adult social care provision, all he had to do was to speak to the Care Quality Commission, with which providers must be registered, or with directors of adult social services who commission care services.

My Lady, I will move now to emphasising the overarching conclusions that these two associations ask you to include in your report on this module of the Inquiry. These points are short and pithy, but I submit they are vital if your report is to address fully what is now known to be needed to prepare for the next pandemic, and they concern the vital role that their member councils play.

I shall summarise them first and then say a little more about each of them. There are three.

One, we must learn from the failures in preparing for Covid to design a better approach to pandemic planning and to ensure that local government is at the core of all future resilience planning.

Two, in this process, local government must be treated as a trusted and equal partner by central government.

Three, local government preparedness has been impacted by austerity, but this cannot be allowed to occur again.

So, turning to the first, that we must learn from the failures in preparing for Covid to design a better approach to pandemic planning and to ensure that local government is at the core of all future resilience planning.

My Lady, between 2009 and 2020, councils, as Category 1 responders, prepared, in line with the government's risk assessment and planning, for an influenza pandemic. Yet, as the Inquiry has already heard, the pandemic that councils had to respond to was different to the one that had been planned for, meaning plans had to be changed or started from scratch. So for the future, government must recognise that any national response works best when it is built from the local level upwards, co-designed with local government rather than imposed, and regularly tested and exercised with local government and not in isolation.

Important work has already been started by the Welsh Government in considering its response to the 2023 independent report into future structures and arrangements for civil contingencies in Wales. The Welsh Local Government Association emphasises that the response needs to be wide-ranging and to address the whole system with local government involved from the outset in any system re-design.

By contrast, much more is necessary in England, where details of the new UK Government Resilience Framework remain limited. Jointly, the two associations submit that the civil contingencies system needs to be treated and managed as a single system, from top to bottom, from central to local, and from strategic to operational. They say that for emergency events, whether of a national or global scale, there has to be a joined-up and co-owned planning system between the UK Government and the devolved governments, with local government fully engaged in this.

This must lead to comprehensive and inclusive national planning arrangements to build preparedness for emergency events of such scale and length. These plans should be maintained and be reviewed and tested at regular intervals by all agencies in the whole system.

The testing processes must have sensible and workable lead-in times, allowing local areas to co-ordinate their local testing approaches. Planning at all levels should be inclusive of the third sector, and they should give the opportunity for stakeholders and representative bodies, for instance those who might be vulnerable or have protected characteristics, to give advice and insight.

Arrangements should be put in place so as to give the public proper assurance about preparedness through access to information and media coverage.

As part of planning, protocols and arrangements should be put in place for clear, timely and co-ordinated public information in the event of a major emergency. These protocols and arrangements should be intergovernmental to avoid public confusion across the home nations.

The systems for national data modelling for the reach and impacts of a national emergency, including the worst-case scenarios for a pandemic or other incidents, should be transparent and well understood.

In preparing for or responding to an actual emergency, the data analysis should be shared within and flow through the civil contingencies system in a timely way.

A peer review system for the local resilience fora should be introduced to provide external insight and local assurance about plans.

Preparedness and resilience need to be reviewed in several key areas of high sensitivity and risk, including: protecting vulnerable people, the protection of dignity in the management of excess death numbers, and the resilience and capacity of the independent residential care home sector.

All information within the system, whatever its confidential or sensitive status, should be shared amongst partners within the system, including local government and other Category 1 responders. And the principle of subsidiarity, localism, should be understood and honoured, so that planning and action are taken at the most local point possible, but equally there must be local input into those national decisions whose impacts will be most felt locally by local communities. And these plans should be subject to democratic oversight at local and national levels, including democratic oversight of the system of preparedness through, for instance, local council scrutiny committees and also Parliamentary committees.

Now, turning next to our second overarching theme, local government must be trusted as an equal partner by central government. I said at the outset in my opening remarks that central government must take active steps to ensure it fully understands how local government works and the complex systems within which it operates.

The evidence that you have received has shown just how little trust and understanding there has been, and also some of the consequences of this.

So my clients want to emphasise in their closing submission that local authorities are not merely delivery bodies, they are democratic representatives of their local communities and they are repositories of expertise and knowledge about their locality and service delivery within it. Forget these points and central government will always be in a mess in a crisis.

But the key point is that, long before a crisis happens, the best resilience will be built on partnership in which each understands and respects the role of the other, because local knowledge, skills and expertise will always be crucial in addressing complex issues that affect diverse communities in the context of a crisis.

Now, while the Welsh Local Government Association recognises that it had a different experience to our English counterparts in preparedness for major emergencies, nonetheless there are lessons there too. Nationally constructed plans for preparedness should be reviewed and updated regularly with the full involvement of all partners, including local authorities and their representative associations.

My Lady, my third overarching point is this: local government preparedness has been impacted by austerity, but this cannot be allowed to occur again. We are grateful to Counsel to the Inquiry who have examined numerous witnesses about the facts and effect of austerity. The associations recognise fully the importance of fiscal prudence at their level, so it's not necessary for me to make general submissions in closing about the effects of the decade or more of austerity on the UK as a whole.

The two associations do, though, want to ensure that you know that they most certainly have a view about the effects of cuts to resources on planning for a pandemic.

In short, it has impacted on councils' ability to plan and prepare effectively, and the focus on protecting the NHS services has meant larger cuts elsewhere in the public sector, including both public health and emergency preparedness.

Reductions in spending have also affected the resilience of public services and influenced the social and economic conditions that impact on people's health in the short and long term.

So what can be said about resources and planning for the future? Well, my Lady, in short, we ask you to say that continued budget cuts will undermine the resilience and capacity of councils to respond to pandemics. If we -- ordinary people, like all of us in this room, able to get out and about -- if persons such as we are to be assured of local governments' capacity to cope and respond to any future emergency of scale and duration, then the budgets for local government must be protected.

Yet we have a duty to look further than us. Such events will, as you have heard, affect those who are less able to get out and be seen and heard, the most vulnerable, those with pre-existing ill or fragile health or comorbidities, those in poor quality housing or who cannot easily shield because they live in larger families or crowded housing. They are likely already to have suffered the worst effects of austerity, and when it comes to planning for a pandemic their particular vulnerabilities must be part of the preparation. They are less able to be resilient on their own. It is not right that they should be expected to shoulder the same burden of austerity measures as or so who are in a better place and more capable of being resilient.

So, my Lady, there should be a greater focus in planning on supporting people with a wider range of health and socio-economic vulnerabilities compared to those who are in a better place and more capable of being resilient, relying on their own resources.

So while direct funding to local resilience fora should be maintained, the government must also recognise that operational capability rests with the responders themselves and they must be adequately funded and resilient.

So finally in this oral submission, my Lady, may I remind you that in my opening submission I set out 13 requests for each association. The evidence that you have received has, we believe, more than demonstrated the good sense of those proposals. I will not repeat them here because I'm confident that the Inquiry team will already have them well in mind.

I ask you, therefore, on behalf of my two clients to note the width and depth of local governments' tasks and responsibilities, to adopt the three overarching points as headline but essential points, and to consider and conclude that my opening two times 13 points are indeed good points to be included in your report as steps that must be taken forward in all future civil contingency planning.

My Lady, I thank you in advance for the report that you propose to deliver on the issues we have discussed in Module 1, and we respect the fact that there is a lot of hard work for you ahead.

Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Allen. On that note, I think it may be time for a coffee break. I shall return at 11.25.
