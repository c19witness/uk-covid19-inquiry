3. Case Direction
=================

**Lady Hallett**: If Professor Edmunds will forgive me, I'll just deal with a case management matter. Forgive me, Professor Edmunds, it won't take long.

At some stage I have to decide the issue of whether to publish the notes made by Sir Patrick Vallance, Government Chief Scientific Adviser, and one of the two main scientific advisers to the government during the worst stages of the pandemic.

To date, the extracts from his notes put to witnesses have been read into the record, and not brought up on screen in the hearing or published as extracts. For other documents the whole page has been displayed and then published, even if the extract referred to is only a small part of the page.

Lawyers representing Sir Patrick have objected to a proposal from the Inquiry team to adopt the same process as is adopted for other documents in relation to Sir Patrick Vallance's notes, and to publish the whole of the relevant page or pages on screen.

They claim that this would be a breach of his Article 8 rights and of his legitimate expectation of privacy. Eight media organisations, supported by some of the core participants, argue that it is in the public interest to publish the whole page and that restricting publication of the notes would breach Article 10 of the European Convention.

Issues arise in relation to Sir Patrick Vallance's notes said to be of an entirely private nature that do not arise in relation to other documents provided to the Inquiry, and I must consider those issues very carefully.

Further, I note that I may well face calls for publication of all the notes at some stage, if I haven't done so already.

The issues of publishing the whole page upon which an extract appears and publishing the whole of the notes are inextricably linked. In my view, therefore, it would be premature to decide the first issue now. I wish to see how the notes are used and the extent of the use. I also wish to hear much fuller submissions on the principal issue of conducting the difficult balancing exercise of Sir Patrick's Article 8 rights and the rights under Article 10. The time for preparation and presentation of submissions at the short hearing on Monday was extremely limited, and therefore the advocates did not have, in my view, sufficient opportunity to address the principal issue in much detail, if at all.

I have decided, therefore, that for the time being we shall adopt the practical approach of bringing up the relevant extracts being put to a witness on screen but not the full page. The extracts will then be published following the day's hearing. We shall proceed on this basis until the resolution of the substantive issue. For documents other than Sir Patrick Vallance's notes, we shall continue to display and publish the whole page or pages, subject only to redactions for sensitive and/or irrelevant private material.

I acknowledge the concerns expressed by some about ensuring that all the most significant passages in the notes are put to witnesses where necessary and I rely on Counsel to the Inquiry and the core participants to ensure that that happens. I too shall be monitoring the situation.

I shall also keep under review whether or not the passages upon which the advocates wish to place reliance should be put into greater context by publishing larger sections of the text.

Thank you.
