This is a fork of https://github.com/dracos/uk-covid19-inquiry (upstream) with a different index of transscripts.

The aim is to keep in sync with upstream's additions of transcripts through to the conclulsion of the UK Covid-19 inquiry

We're interested in the addition of comments in the following style:

"At this moment the witness could have been asked where they got the two-meters distance will keep you safe from transmission from"

Constraints:

1. We're only interested in comments that are in the is-predominently-airborne, is-not-predominetnly-airborne, is-predominently-droplets and is-predominently-fomites (the last three are not true)

2. We're not intested in vaccines-harm comments

We and you believe that:

* Covid is not mild, 
* Long Covid is real and there's a compounding chance you will transition to that after repeated infections
* Long Covid is not all in the mind (the ME/CFS and Lyme community have battled this for decades)
* You can seemingly fully recover from Covid-19 then go on to cardicvascular incidents that will have a 911 call and being sped by ambulance to ER/ED (999 & A&E in the UK)
* You  can seemingly fully recover from Covid-19, but have lowered CD4 and CD8 counts that mean you're up for a basked of really bad opportunisitic medical conditions.
