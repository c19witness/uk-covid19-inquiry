8. Submissions on Behalf of Scottish Covid Bereaved by Ms Mitchell KC
=====================================================================

**Ms Mitchell**: My Lady, I'm instructed by lead solicitor Aamer Anwar and April Meechan on behalf of the Scottish Covid Bereaved.

This group was set up to ensure Scotland's voice is to be heard both at the UK and Scottish Inquiries.

My learned juniors Kevin McCaffery and Kevin Henry assist me, along with the Inquiry's department and Aamer Anwar & Company.

The Scottish Covid Bereaved wish to thank Jane Morrison and all those who gave evidence this morning on behalf of the four nation groups, and also thank those in the groups themselves. They remind us why we are all here and why the recommendations that you, my Lady, will consider making are vitally important to the health of everyone in the UK now and in the future.

The right of every person is to the enjoyment of the highest standard of health, as the 1946 Constitution of the World Health Organisation noted when it stated:

"The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition."

The right highlights the need for real equality, because discriminated, vulnerable and marginalised groups often share a disproportionate amount of health problems. As Dr Richard Horton stated in his evidence, Covid was not an equal opportunity virus.

Having received disclosure over the past six months and listened to the evidence over the past six weeks, the Scottish Covid Bereaved considers that the UK and Scottish Governments have failed in their obligations to protect the health of those within it by failing to prepare for what they knew was an inevitable pandemic.

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organisation have identified key aspects of the right to health. They include the right to prevention, treatment and control of disease; there was a duty to protect. The right to access to essential medication, services, goods and facilities that must be available in sufficient quantity, accessible, acceptable and of good quality; that duty existed too. States cannot justify a failure to respect their obligations because of lack of resources. States must guarantee the right to health to the maximum of their available resources.

The Special Rapporteur on the right to health has stated that health systems have to have several components, but two which might be important to consideration in the present case is an adequate system for the collection of data, and that data to be disaggregated, ie to be separated on certain grounds such as sex, age, ethnicity.

Further, it says that national capacity to produce a sufficient number of well trained health workers who enjoy good terms and conditions of employment are part of the right in respect of health.

The Scottish Covid Bereaved see none of these standards were reached pre-pandemic, and therefore it is unsurprising that we invite the Chair to answer the question which she posed at the outset six weeks ago: was the UK prepared for a pandemic? No. Can we learn lessons for the future? Yes, undoubtedly.

We will submit in writing detailed submissions on the proposed recommendations for you, my Lady, to consider, and in doing so we will take into account the helpful submissions that we heard made today. But for present purposes we just wish to highlight three following issues which were, in part, the reasons for lack of preparation and which recommendations we'll need to address if we are to understand how to be prepared when the next pandemic arrives.

The first of these, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the impact and effect of the ten years of austerity.

My Lady, you have now heard that the policy of austerity led to chronic underfunding of the National Health Service in the decade preceding the pandemic. The National Security Council Threats, Hazards, Resilience and Contingencies committee was set up to scan the horizon and act as an early warning system. This was done at the same time as the National Health Service was being brought to its knees with chronic underfunding. This was wholly counterstrategic, the equivalent of spending money on a tsunami warning system whilst at the same time allowing the sea wall defences to crumble.

David Cameron said it was prudent to fix the roof while the sun is shining, but the weather forecast warned of imminent torrential rainstorms, and those who worked in the National Health Service and the care sector repeatedly and pointedly warned that the long-term underfunding left the NHS in crisis, barely able to deal with a winter flu, let alone a pandemic.

In 2018, the BMA warned that if funding for the NHS was not increased further there was a very real risk to patient safety, as the NHS would lack the staff and resources to deliver quality patient care. The sustained underfunding of the NHS led doctors to fear for public safety and making medical mistakes. Staff retention, which was already poor before Brexit, worsened. The BMA has contended this has affected well-being and morale of workers.

The effect of ten years of austerity was also felt elsewhere in society, and if I may quote from one of the productions provided to us from the BMA:

"Doctors are concerned about the impact of austerity and associated welfare reform on health and wellbeing, and believe governments need to do more to protect the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society who suffer a disproportionate burden. They witness first-hand the detrimental effects on their patients' health and wellbeing but are unable to directly address the contributory factors that are beyond their clinical influence. These factors are linked to a range of economic and social policies that affect wellbeing and welfare, social security, employment, families and communities, health and social care, pensions, living conditions, social housing, and education."

We have heard that the pleas of those involved in the healthcare system remained unanswered by the time Covid reached our shores. Had proper consideration been given to pandemic planning, the first step would have been to make our care services healthy, to prioritise the health service so that when the inevitable pandemic arrived we were ready for it.

Two, the effects of Brexit. In conjunction with underfunding, work on the no-deal exit from the EU was prioritised over pandemic planning. Evidence of this might be most obvious in the fact that the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board didn't meet between November 2018 and November 2019.

It was suggested by Mr Gove that he was not aware of any impact that pausing to work on Brexit had caused. The Chair has evidence from the experts which clearly set out the work preparing for the pandemic had stopped. Vital work had not yet been completed, such as guidance on NHS triage arrangements, the operational plans for adult social care, a revised and updated version of the 2011 pandemic influenza strategy, which by 2020 had not been updated to include valuable learning which could have been taken from MERS or SARS, the Hine report or Exercise Cygnus.

The effect of leaving the EU, as mentioned above, was also being felt in the inability to retain sufficient staff to work in care facilities and hospitals throughout the NHS. That in turn placed additional stress and workloads on those who were working in those jobs.

Pandemic planning cannot take second place to any other events, and resilience must be found to ensure that, regardless of whatever else might be happening, pandemic planning remains prioritised, and that is a reflection of how serious we understand that the risk is.

Three, failure of experts.

The Inquiry has heard repeated explanation that the focus was placed on a flu pandemic and this was a significant factor in lack of preparedness. It is not clear why this was so. A flu pandemic would still have many similarities to a Covid one and would still have required many of the same preparations. There was also a misplaced confidence in the ability of the UK as a world leader to deal with a pandemic, and a seemingly inexplicable failure to learn valuable lessons from countries which had and were dealing with pandemic viruses. Groupthink was blamed for lack of scientific enquiry.

The Scottish Covid Bereaved believe that experts must have the time, opportunity and independent funding not only to learn the lessons that this last pandemic has taught us but also have a regulated streamlined way in which scientific advice can be given to governments to allow them to take properly informed decisions to protect health.

These three issues are far from the only ones. Issues such as the myriad groups with reliance on acronyms, lack of joined-up communication, governmental memory being short, the relationship between governments, the engagement or otherwise of the Scottish Ministers in pandemic planning, the way Scottish health groups were organised, and whether the ethos, admirable, that resilience was everyone's business in fact actually worked. These will be addressed in written submissions.

Ultimately we had the science, we had the expertise, but a decade of austerity, focus on planning for a no-deal Brexit, chaotic administration, lack of communication, chronic underfunding of the very services we rely on to protect our health, meant that we were in no way prepared for the pandemic when it arrived on our shores.

My Lady, at the outset of our submissions we quoted Albert Marrin, emeritus professor of history, who wrote in 2018, writing as he was on the great flu of the influenza pandemic of 1918, that:

"When the next pandemic comes, as it surely will some day, perhaps we will be ready to meet it. If we are not, the outcomes will be very, very, very, dreadful."

Sadly, in the UK we were not ready to meet it, and the outcome, as we'll come to consider in the modules to come, was very, very, very dreadful.

These are the oral submissions on behalf of the Scottish Covid Bereaved.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Mitchell, extremely helpful.
