9. Submissions on Behalf of the Association of Directors of Public Health by Mr Ford KC
=======================================================================================

**Mr Ford**: Thank you very much.

My Lady, I'm going to be relatively brief on behalf of the Association of Directors of Public Health. Like others, we're going to put in more comprehensive written submissions which will set out everything we want to say about the issues with which this part of the Inquiry is concerned.

Those will include our views on the part played by the directors of public health in the pandemic response during the Module 1 period; secondly, the views of the members of the Association on the part that they feel they should have played to achieve a more effective response when the pandemic struck; and, thirdly, the reforms that the association suggests should be made in order to hope that such an effective response can be achieved in the future.

The Inquiry has heard the evidence of Professor McManus about the vital role that directors of public health believe they could and should have played in the period leading up to the pandemic and the widely held view amongst directors of public health that they were in effect ignored by central government in the planning for a pandemic and in the early pandemic management.

We mentioned two striking examples of that in opening. The first was that there appeared to be an absence of an up-to-date list of contact details for the directors of public health in their local authority bases within the Department of Health and Social Care; and, secondly, the fact that the directors were themselves learning about central government plans and initiatives from the televised briefings designed to inform members of the public what was going on.

It is the view of Professor McManus and the directors that the response next time needs to be joined-up, a system-wide plan rather than top-down prescription from central government.

You have heard that Professor McManus's evidence was corroborated, I think by all of the other witnesses from whom the Inquiry has heard who work at the local public health level. Professor Fenton of the Faculty of Public Health, and the English and Welsh representatives of the Local Government Associations, Mark Lloyd and Chris Llewelyn, their evidence referred to the pivotal nature of the local voice, both in public health generally and more specifically in emergency planning.

The message has been a consistent one: of course it was important to protect the NHS capacity so it could fulfil its vital role in treating patients infected by the Covid virus, but if proper use had been made of public health resources at a local level, the National Health Service would have had fewer patients to treat. As one of the members of the ADPH team put it, it makes more sense to help people give up smoking than focusing all your resources and attentions on treating them for lung cancer.

It's a point made by witnesses outside the public health sector. Matt Hancock said that he had come to believe that the focus at the outset of the pandemic should have been on preventing the spread of Covid rather than on treating those who became infective. That, he said, was a flawed doctrine, and the directors of public health agree with that.

As the Inquiry knows, health protection and improvement at a local level is very much what the public health system is there to deliver, both generally and the directors of public health in particular, and they have significant skills and experiences in that area.

The local role is reflected by the fact that, at least in England, they are placed within local authority homes(?) rather than in health structures, and, as we will elaborate in our written submissions, they are very keen to remain so placed.

Overall, my Lady, when the next pandemic strikes there should be systems and structures in place to ensure that the first thing that happens is that local public health professionals, directors of public health and others, are mobilised to put health protection measures in place immediately and that they have the powers to do so effectively.

The detail of how they say that should be achieved will appear in our written submissions in more detail, but the broad areas are as follows:

Promoting a better understanding of the role of the directors of public health, both within government and more generally.

Making better use of the directors in local public health planning, including exercise planning.

Reviewing the structures and the functions of the LRFs and the LHRPs.

Drawing on existing local expertise in matters such as test and trace rather than creating parallel structures from scratch.

Ensuring effective communication up and down the system at all levels.

Creating provision for effective data flow by primary legislative changes if necessary.

Encouraging the allocation of sufficient resources so that workforce numbers and training are adequate, and I think every representative who has addressed you so far this afternoon has made the point that they were not.

And creating national guidance to address health inequalities in emergency planning.

On that last point, my Lady, and finally, in a society which has such regional, economic and cultural diversity, it was a significant mistake, ADPH says, not to take advantage of resources and expertise at the local level. Knowledge of the particular needs of local communities was crucial. Their message is: local matters, and ADPH's members believe that the pandemic response could have been so much better and that, if it had, lives would have been saved.

My Lady, ADPH and its members are very grateful for the opportunity to get these points across to the Inquiry. Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Ford.

I think that's as far as we can go today.

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, that is it for today.

**Lady Hallett**: So a great deal of food for thought from all the submissions, and I'm really grateful for those. I'm sure there will be yet more food for thought tomorrow.

10 o'clock tomorrow, please.

**Mr Keith**: Thank you.
