7. Submissions on Behalf of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru by Ms Heaven
==================================================================================

**Ms Heaven**: Thank you, good afternoon, my Lady.

As you know, I represent the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice for Cymru. They experienced first-hand the failures in Wales to prepare for a pandemic, and you've just heard very powerful testimony from Anna-Louise which reflects the experience of very many people in Wales. Loved ones were lost in traumatic circumstances and the pain and suffering continues.

It has been very difficult for the Welsh bereaved to listen to the evidence heard in this Inquiry over recent weeks. It is now beyond doubt that the Welsh Government and Welsh institutions tasked with protecting the people of Wales not only failed to prepare for a pandemic in Wales but they also failed to build resilience in Wales.

The Welsh people have been profoundly let down by their government and it's now time for lessons to be learnt and for there to be accountability.

It was very disappointing to the Cymru group to hear that some of the witnesses giving evidence before this Inquiry still do not appear to accept all the criticisms that were put to them and that appear in the documents before the Inquiry.

The Inquiry has heard that a more severe and devastating pandemic is an inevitability. There needs to be a fundamental change in approach to preparedness for the next pandemic in Wales, and a willingness to be candid about what went wrong and why. If this does not happen, Wales will not be prepared and more Welsh people will lose their lives.

Pandemic planning in Wales was flawed in the same fundamental way as planning in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Scotland, in that the focus was solely on planning for an influenza pandemic. The consequences of this failure were stark. The focus was not on halting community transmission, as it should have been, or thinking about non-pharmaceutical interventions. This had devastating consequences when Covid-19 arrived in Wales and around the UK. PPE was not available for healthcare professionals, there was a failure to understand the importance of :outline:`mask wearing` and the need for large-scale contact tracing and testing, mass gatherings were not cancelled, and there was no awareness of the need for quarantining and social distancing.

These failures in planning assumptions were unjustifiable. The world had already experienced two coronavirus pandemics, major epidemics, in the 21st century, SARS and MERS. Both had profound effects in East Asian countries, and as a result those countries had learnt lessons about pandemic planning and preparedness. The lessons learned by the East Asian countries were readily available in the World Health Organisation literature, and could and should have been in the UK and used in the United Kingdom, including in Wales' pandemic planning.

The Inquiry heard evidence from Professor Heymann and Dr Richard Horton, who gave poignant evidence of how since 2004 the global community knew that coronaviruses were a major threat, yet there was a general groupthink in the United Kingdom to focus only on the threat of influenza.

Witnesses were prisoners of their own ill-informed assumptions, and did not even consider looking to the East Asian countries for guidance. In the words of Quentin Sandifer of Public Health Wales:

"... on lockdowns, I think it's fair to say from my own professional experience, I hadn't envisaged circumstances where we would have locked down a whole society or, indeed, a whole country in the way that we did in March 2020."

Mr Drakeford was asked whether, in his capacity as health minister or First Minister for Wales, whether he'd asked about the risk of a novel virus or a Disease X breaking out and whether Wales was prepared, to which he responded that he had not. Mr Drakeford had first-hand experience of the response to SARS, MERS and Ebola during his political career in Wales. The Cymru group considers that the threat of a pandemic requires a much more robust spirit of political enquiry.

Mr Drakeford was not the only minister who did not ask the questions that needed to be asked. There needs to be an across-the-board change in mindset as regards thinking about and discussing scientific opinion on pandemic risk.

But was it really the case that no one in Wales as asking the right questions? As far back as 2013 the Inquiry can see that Wales' own Health Emergency Preparedness Unit's annual pandemic planning conference included a talk by Dr John Watkins, now Professor Watkins, and of note he has provided you, my Lady, with a very interesting witness statement to this Inquiry.

In 2013, Professor Watkins was a consultant epidemiologist in Public Health Wales and he can be seen talking publicly about how current threats included a novel virus and that planning assumptions in Wales must consider that it could see the emergence of such novel virus with a possibility of little background immunity and no vaccine available with transmissibility akin to the Spanish influenza pandemic.

The Cymru group asked the Inquiry to get to the bottom of whether the Welsh Government was in fact warned about the risks of a novel virus, and if so why such warnings were not heeded.

Aside from being fundamentally flawed because of narrow planning assumptions, pandemic preparedness in Wales was not a sufficiently high priority within the Welsh Government. This failure to prioritise pandemic planning is perfectly illustrated by the flawed approach in Wales to understanding and managing Tier 1 pandemic risk. As the Inquiry has heard, the United Kingdom held a UK National Risk Register which identified pandemic influenza as a Tier 1 risk. However, in Wales, pandemic risk was downgraded by virtue of it being taken out of the Welsh Government Corporate Risk Register and only then included, under a general heading on the 2019 register, under "Disruption Event[s]".

The risk remained in the health and social services group risk register, but this simply did not give it the overall prominence that it quite clearly warranted.

Of note, the health and social services risk register was not disclosed to the Inquiry by the Welsh Government until the Thursday before the Welsh witnesses gave evidence at this Inquiry, and so there was insufficient time to provide this document to core participants.

The risk rating of a pandemic was also downgraded in Wales. This was despite there apparently being limited resources to implement devolved civil contingency powers, a failure to implement recommendations from Exercise Taliesin and Cygnus, and a failure to complete task workstreams on pandemic planning.

The risk of a pandemic in Wales had been downgraded but they had simply not been mitigated.

Mr Drakeford now recognises that Wales should have had its own national risk assessment process. However, immediately after devolution there was a need to ensure a Welsh-specific assessment of risk that honestly reflected the vulnerabilities in Wales in respect of a pandemic. This did not happen.

I now turn to pandemic planning in Wales. As the Inquiry has heard, formal pandemic planning was woefully inadequate. Wales did not formally plan for the impact of lockdown measures, but tested them only after Covid-19 arrived in the United Kingdom. There was no testing for surge capacity, no evidence of a plan or strategy to deal with excess deaths or the consequences of adequate planning in relation to post death procedures or to protect dignity and support the Welsh bereaved in the event of a pandemic.

The witnesses to this Inquiry have not given a satisfactory explanation for these failures.

Wales participated in Exercise Cygnus 2014 and the national Exercise Cygnus in 2016. This 2016 exercise, as you know, gave rise to a finding that the United Kingdom's preparedness and response "in terms of its plans, policies and capabilities was not sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic that would have a nationwide impact across all sectors". There were four key learning outcomes and 22 detailed lessons, with 12 recommendations applying to Wales.

Sir Frank Atherton, Chief Medical Officer, stated that he was aware of HEPU maintaining a log of progress on the outcomes of Cygnus 2016, but the Inquiry heard that workstreams were not completed, and whilst it was recognised that the Welsh strategic documents required updating, this did not happen. For example, the Wales Health and Social Care Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Guidance and the Wales Framework for Managing Infectious Disease Emergencies remained in their 2014 versions and were not updated in light of the 2016 Cygnus report. The local resilience forum pandemic -- of 2013 -- guidance was also not updated.

A concern was raised, as you heard, by Reg Kilpatrick in July 2018 regarding the Welsh Government's level of engagement and provision of resource to the progress of pandemic influenza preparedness. Notwithstanding the concerns raised, no further resource was committed to pandemic planning and no further work was completed in respect of the guidance.

Now, the Inquiry has learnt that after Cygnus in 2016, the Welsh Government also set up the Wales Pandemic Flu Preparedness Group to progress tasks but this group for the last time in September to October 2018 and, as the Inquiry has established, there were many tasks but they were not finished.

The Inquiry heard evidence that the work in Wales was in effect shadowing the UK-wide group, however there were no impediments to the Welsh Government getting on with drawing up plans and guidance. This work could and should have been progressed to fruition with greater urgency.

The failure to do this meant that when Covid-19 hit Wales' health and social care infrastructure, it was simply not able to cope. This was an unforgivable failure, not least because in 2014 Exercise Taliesin raised a concern about capacity in the adult social care sector and that it could not cope with the demands of a pandemic. This had not been resolved in 2016, and it was still not resolved when Covid-19 hit.

The Cymru group experienced the consequences of these shocking failures on preparation and planning. Many loved ones lost their lives in hospitals and care homes in traumatic circumstances with inadequate means of protection.

The Cymru group consider that preparing for a no-deal EU exit was simply not a sufficient reason to justify significantly interrupting all the preparations for the Tier 1 risk of a pandemic in Wales.

The Welsh people were not told that such life and death choices were being made for them. They should have been.

From the evidence before the Inquiry, a clear picture emerges of a lack of adequate attention paid to pandemic preparedness at all levels of government over many, many years. The Inquiry has heard deeply concerning evidence from Mr Vaughan Gething, who has served as Deputy Minister for Health, the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Well-being and Sport, and, latterly, Minister for Health and Social Services until May 2021. He told the Inquiry that before October 2016 pandemic risk for Wales "wasn't, as it were, brought to my direct attention that it was something that I needed to be particularly prepared for". He said that whilst he became aware that a pandemic was a priority in Wales in the run-up to Exercise Cygnus, before then he'd simply not understood that pandemic risk was in the Tier 1 risk register. He did not read the risk register. He candidly admitted that pandemic preparedness:

"... [did not] have the same priority as those headline issues that ... take up lots of life and energy of the government ..."

And that there is a learning lessons point arising from the challenge of dealing with "what comes up" and "longer term priorities". Mr Gething stated that he was advised that Cygnus learning points had been identified and would be implemented, and he assumed, absent any advice to the contrary, or questions in the Senedd, that the lessons of Cygnus had been applied. Mr Gething did not read the report of the outcome of Cygnus and admits that had he read the conclusion about lack of preparedness he would almost certainly have asked extra questions and asked for more assurances about implementation.

Mr Gething accepted that it was fair to say that if he'd put more time into this work then he may well have sped up preparedness.

It is shocking that ministerial political oversight needed for such an important issue was simply absent from someone in the position of Mr Gething. This was a catastrophic and indefensible failure.

The failure continues. The Welsh Government were warned eight years before Covid-19 hit that there was a fragmented labyrinthine system dealing with pandemic resilience in Wales, in which accountabilities were unclear. No action was taken.

A Wales audit report of December 2012 on civil emergencies in Wales noted that "too many emergency planning groups and unclear accountabilities add efficiency to the already complex resilience framework and that the complexity risks fragmentation of resilience activity with potential overlap or collapse in the arrangements for resilience".

This structure did not significantly change prior to the Transfer of Functions Order under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 in 2018. Mr Drakeford accepted in oral evidence that a review of civil contingencies arrangements remained outstanding going into the pandemic. This was yet another indefensible failure on the part of the Welsh Government.

Now, a matter of real significance to the Cymru group is hospital-acquired Covid-19. Many people in Wales died because they caught Covid-19 in Welsh hospitals with inadequate :outline:`ventilation` and poor infection control.

It has been deeply concerning and upsetting to learn about the extent to which this issue was simply not a priority for the Welsh Government and NHS Wales.

The Welsh Government's key pandemic preparedness guidance of 2014 identified the importance of infection control and control arrangements, the need for meticulous use of infection control, isolation and cohort nursing, and the need to be able to care for large numbers of infectious patients on a scale outside their normal experience.

This was not new news. Since 2004, in the wake of SARS, the Welsh Government and those responsible for pandemic planning and preparedness in Wales had known about the lack of facilities to deal with high-consequence infectious diseases in Wales and the need for general improvement in infection control in Welsh hospitals.

However, inadequate action was taken over many years. When Covid-19 struck, Welsh hospitals could not cope with infection prevention and control. In addition, it was known over many years that microbiology and infection services were fragile and struggling to deliver on a day-to-day basis the prevention, early diagnosis and frontline support that professionals and the public require.

Wales could not even deal with one high-consequence infectious disease when the pandemic hit. Since 2006 NHS Wales has surveyed and produced annual reports on all :outline:`airborne` isolation rooms in major hospitals across Wales. Every year the reports concluded that many of these isolation rooms were inadequate. In 2017 the :outline:`airborne` Isolation Rooms Review Working Group produced a report to inform policy on :outline:`airborne` isolation rooms in major acute hospitals. The report concluded that building structures did not support safe management of patients with infectious disease.

It is again important to say that it's staggering to learn that there was no one single health board in Wales capable of dealing with a high-consequence infectious disease.

Frank Atherton, Chief Medical Officer, and Quentin Sandifer, Public Health Wales, knew about this state of affairs. In the early days, Covid-19 was classified as a high-consequence infectious disease. The Cymru group consider that there was a systemic failure in Wales to improve infection control in Welsh hospitals and the lack of urgency around the high-consequence infectious disease issue is merely illustrative of a general lack of focus on infection control from devolution onwards.

The Cymru group ask the Inquiry to robustly examine the state of infection control in Welsh hospitals in Module 2B.

Turning to PPE, Audit Wales have been damning in their April 2021 report on PPE, and have clearly illustrated that PPE stockpiles were inadequate, not just for a coronavirus pandemic but for the pandemic planned for, namely influenza with waves lasting 15 weeks. The same applies to the arrangements to distribute the PPE in a timely manner. These were also inadequate. More work could and should have been done in advance of the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure both a sufficient stockpile of PPE in terms of the amounts, the expiry dates, the correct types and ensuring a robust distribution system.

I now turn to health inequalities. Health inequalities in Wales were not adequately considered, particularly in the context of pandemic planning. Professors Bambra and Sir Michael Marmot gave compelling evidence of how a whole-system catastrophic shock exposures and amplifies pre-existing health inequalities. They consider that pre-existing health inequalities were only considered in a minimal way by both the United Kingdom and devolved administrations. The Cymru group agree.

The Inquiry has heard that Public Health Wales' emergency response plan made references to vulnerabilities but that there was no explicit references to those with comorbidities, older people or health inequalities. Again, this is simply inexcusable, not least because the Welsh Government was bound by legal duties under the Equality Act 2010.

The Welsh Government has made a qualified admission in relation to failing to take adequate steps in relation to health inequalities. The Cymru group consider that they need to go much further.

Finally, briefly, lessons to be learned. The Cymru group considers that the headline conclusion of Mann and Alexander that -- there needs to be a radical shift to put in place a single integrated and professional civil protection system which is fit for the future we face, and capable of providing an effective whole-system, whole-of-society response to emergencies on a catastrophic scale, as well as being able to tackle emergencies at a local and regional level.

The group considers that, for Wales, this means a system which is reflective of Welsh data and Welsh risk assessment, supplemented by clear and meaningful arrangements for intergovernmental information sharing and working, and a clear and robust infrastructure for decision-making and leadership across the whole of government on this issue.

Science must play a central role in the system and three short points are made on the science:

First, as Sir Jeremy Farrar described in his evidence, scientific infrastructure must be maintained to ensure the United Kingdom and Wales is prepared for the next pandemic.

Second, scientific advice must be readily available to all decision-makers in a timely way, for example there must be a clear line of communication for information from NERVTAG and SAGE.

Third, scientific advice must be transparent and liable to challenge. Safeguards are required to ensure that the science is less liable to groupthink, less closed and more open to scrutiny and challenge.

Fourth, there must be clear audit trails demonstrating how the science has informed political decision-making.

Within the political arena, the following changes are required:

First, there is a need for clear leadership on issues of resilience and preparedness. At a UK level there should be a senior Cabinet Minister devoted solely to the resilience and preparedness portfolio; such a function is equally important for Wales.

Whilst in Wales the function has traditionally been carried out by the First Minister, as Reg Kilpatrick acknowledged, the appointment of a dedicated minister for resilience and preparedness could provide a greater impetus in the day-to-day work of preparedness and resilience.

Second, there is a need for clarity and streamlining in respect of preparedness and resilience in Wales, updating and harmonisation of plans, in order to ensure that the system works together as a coherent whole rather than a set of plans.

Third, the development of Wales' specific plans should be informed by a Wales risk register which will look to the UK register but the Welsh Government needs to apply its mind to its own centralised assessment of risk.

Fourth, senior ministers and key personnel must be adequately trained in crisis management and there must be a robust system of audit and assurance to support the sharing of best practice and drive organisational learning and development, and a clear audit trail to demonstrate how decisions have been made, together with assurance frameworks to ensure plans are stress tested and robust.

Finally, from an operational perspective, there must be adequate investment in infrastructure and workforce resilience, because without those systems no plan will work.

Ultimately, the success of any radical shift can only be ensured if there is accountability and strong leadership in the Welsh Government.

As you know, my Lady, the Cymru group has continuously called upon the Welsh Government to acknowledge its failures and to take responsibility for them. Without such accountability, lessons will not be learnt.

The Cymru group also note that the Welsh Government have at no stage said sorry to Welsh bereaved families. These same families have battled through their own grief to campaign and to shine a light in this Inquiry on the failures of pandemic planning. Given the evidence before the Inquiry, it's right to say that an apology to the Welsh bereaved from the Welsh Government is now long overdue.

So, finally, the Welsh Government must now reflect on the evidence which this Inquiry has heard, acknowledge its failures and provide a strong commitment to the systemic change required to prevent a future loss of life.

Diolch, thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Heaven, very grateful.

Ms Mitchell.
