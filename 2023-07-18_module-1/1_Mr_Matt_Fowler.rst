*MR MATT FOWLER (affirmed).*

Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Fowler, thank you so much for contributing to the Inquiry, and if at any stage you need a break, please just say.

**The Witness**: Thank you very much.

**Mr Keith**: Could you give the Inquiry, please, your full name.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: My name is Matthew Ian Fowler.

**Lead Inquiry**: Mr Fowler, thank you for attending this morning to give evidence, and thank you also for the provision of a number of statements that you and your group have provided this Inquiry.

I would like to ask you, please, some questions about the loss of your father, Ian Fowler, and then ask you some questions about the nature of the group that you co-founded, and also then to set out the concerns expressed by you and your group about the areas of the public response to the Covid pandemic where you believe things went wrong, in order to be able to properly found the future work of this Inquiry.

Your father was a retired engineer from Jaguar Land Rover, is that correct?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: That's correct. He worked for Jaguar Land Rover for 29 years. At the time of his -- by the end of his career he was working in the design offices at Gaydon, having been an employee for, you know, most of his working life. He had started as a welder engineer as a young man.

Actually the story about his interview is quite significant, it says a lot about him as a person. He turned up for his interview as a welder for Solihull, working on Defender. At the time there were a number of people that had been -- were being interviewed. However, the MIG welder machine they were supposed to be using to carry out the trial, if you like, wasn't working, and when my dad arrived he saw it wasn't working, repaired it, and was the only man on the day to put down a weld. He was the sort of guy that was very practical, very hard working and he was always the sort of guy to, you know, get the work done no matter what.

Unsurprisingly, he progressed very quickly in his time at Jaguar Land Rover. He was promoted to group leader, a job that I'm now doing myself, and eventually moved into engineering, first in reverse engineering, he then moved into design, and was responsible for introducing rapid prototyping to the company, was key to getting the first 3D printers there. The latter part of his career was spent on SVO, which is special vehicle operations, where they were doing sort of one-off builds and things like that, one of which was Project 7, which was a D-type inspired car.

**Lead Inquiry**: It's lovely to hear --

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- everything about the nature of the work he did at Jaguar Land Rover. Can I bring you forward --

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Sure.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- to 2019, though, and ask you: did the time come when he retired from his job?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Well, this is what I was going to say. Towards the end of his career, he worked on these special vehicles and that wound him down to taking voluntary redundancy.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was that in March 2019?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: March 2019.

**Lead Inquiry**: From your statement, Mr Fowler, it appears that he was in good health. He was a man who loved sport --

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- he seemed to have played everything that he possibly could, and no doubt loved a round of golf with you. In March of 2020, was he in generally quite good health?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah. Dad had been quite an active guy for most of his life. You're right in saying that he did play many sports, everything, football, boxing, cricket, from a young age. He maintained an active lifestyle through his sort of 30s and 40s and, as he got older, took a more -- interest in a more sedate sport, being golf, but he would play frequently, several times a week. You know, I've always said that golf's a good way to ruin a good walk, but he enjoyed it a lot and that was something that he took a lot of pleasure in.

**Lead Inquiry**: That --

**Mr Matt Fowler**: He also had two dogs that he used to walk frequently, and he was -- at the time of his death he was working on landscaping a garden. He was a very active -- active guy.

**Lead Inquiry**: But did there come a time in March of 2020 when he appeared to have caught the disease Covid?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just if you could just give us the timeframe, Mr Fowler: do you know when he caught Covid, either generally or specifically?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Generally, yes. This is quite -- again, this is quite significant.

**Lead Inquiry**: Mr Fowler, will you allow me to develop the account? It's very important that there are areas which we develop and which you can give evidence about to my Lady, and areas which I can't ask you about, because of the rulings that we have in this case.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Sure.

**Lead Inquiry**: So he caught Covid at some point in March 2020. Do you know when that was specifically?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: So dad started showing symptoms of Covid around the 18th or 19th of March, where around there. So he would have been infected some time around -- well, between the 14th and then.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was he able to cope with the infection in the early days, at the start, or did there come a time when he began to struggle and needed hospital attention?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: He tried not to make a fuss for quite some time. He put off seeking any help until it got to the point that he was struggling to breathe significantly, and on 22 March rang the emergency services and was admitted to hospital on 23 March, which was the day of the first lockdown.

**Lead Inquiry**: When he was taken into the hospital, was he tested for whether or not he had Covid?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: He was.

**Lead Inquiry**: What was the result?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: It was a positive result.

**Lead Inquiry**: May we take it that the hospital staff cared for him and looked after him as best they could?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: I have got nothing bad to say about the George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton where he was admitted. They worked really hard to do whatever they could for him for the entire time that he spent in the hospital.

So the first five days on a nebuliser, with steroids, and oxygen to try and do the best that they could. But eventually his condition swan dived, he could no longer breathe without the assistance of the nebuliser, and they made the choice to intubate him. That was about five days into his hospital stay.

Then they fought daily for him for about two and a half weeks, by which point his major organs started to fail and the hospital contacted us and said that there was no longer anything they could do for him and they made the decision to withdraw his life support and allow him to pass peacefully.

**Lead Inquiry**: So he had been on life support towards the end. The hospital contacted you, did they, to tell you that they were going to withdraw life support?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah, a few days before they'd said that if his condition wasn't -- didn't start to improve, then there would be nothing more they could do for him. So we were -- we were notified in advance, and we hoped beyond hope that something would change, but it wasn't the case, and sadly dad didn't make it.

**Lead Inquiry**: And did he die on April 13?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: April 13.

**Lead Inquiry**: Your statement recounts how, because of the regulations and the procedures which were then in force, the arrangements for his funeral were extremely difficult.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: They were.

**Lead Inquiry**: Could you just briefly confirm to my Lady that your father's funeral took place under those restrictions that you identify in the statement, that is to say there were terrible limits on the number of persons from the family who could attend, the procedure and the course of the service and the ceremony and the burial were markedly affected by the rules, effectively denying your father considerable dignity in death?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Dad was an incredibly popular man, and it was a source of great pain for everybody that knew him that they would not be able to attend his funeral. Only ten people were allowed there on the day, all had to be socially distanced, due to those limitations, and as an illustration of how popular my dad was and the impact that he had on the people around him, over 300 people lined the streets for the procession. It was -- it was quite moving. And my uncle actually commented on the day that he felt like he'd accidentally joined Elvis's procession instead.

But, yeah, dad couldn't be viewed. It was closed casket, obviously. Due to the restrictions and the possibility of contagion, dad actually had to be cremated in his hospital gown. And to anybody that's spent any time in hospital, the gowns aren't very dignified at any point and certainly not something that you would consider to be dignified for somebody making their final journey.

The funeral director, who was also family, my uncle David, he had to lay an outfit on top of the casket, to try and give us something. There was no opportunity to display the body, as had been in previous funerals that I'd been to, to, you know, say your final goodbyes or anything like that. It was very much a, he was -- he was there, I remember spending time with him on his birthday in January, and then he disappeared off the face of the planet and I never saw him again.

**Lead Inquiry**: About a month or so after your father passed away, did you read an article about a person called Jo Goodman who had lost her dad as well?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: I did.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was that in May of 2020?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: That was towards the end of April.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did you contact her?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: What happened was the article spoke about Jo's dad, Stuart, who had also passed away from Covid, and talked about her feelings about what had happened. The comment section, as these things were prone to be at the time, were filled with some quite negative and unpleasant comments from people at the time, that of Covid deniers and -- and some very negative people.

**Lead Inquiry**: Can I pause you there?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Sure.

**Lead Inquiry**: Mr Fowler, from your statement, it appears that, both at that time and later, when you had started and -- you had founded and you had started to run the group, Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, appallingly you received a considerable amount, perhaps a vast amount of criticism, of vitriolic attacks on social media, people challenging the aims of your group and what you were trying to achieve, attacking you personally.

Is that something that happened throughout this whole time? And give us, please, some indication of the level of such material.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: This is something that I think all of the bereaved have been subjected to over the course of the last three years. It's certainly --

**Lead Inquiry**: When you say bereaved, bereaved in your group or bereaved generally?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah. Bereaved in our group.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is this on social media?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Largely, although it hasn't been exclusively on social media. There has also been -- it's happened in person as well in some cases.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: But, yes, that attitude of Covid denial, or Covid scepticism, anti-mask protesters, vaccine sceptics, those people have often targeted me and members of the group that I represent. Sometimes they have gone out of the way to seek people out. We've had people that have made media appearances talking about their loss who have then been stalked via social media and abused, and in some cases threatened.

One of the things that I would like to point out is that had my dad died from something else, say cancer, people wouldn't be coming to me and saying, "Well, was it really cancer?" It's something that has been very unique to our loss to be targeted in that way.

**Lead Inquiry**: Coming back to May of 2020, yourself and Ms Goodman decided to co-found the group, and did you become and are you now chair of the board of directors as the co-founder of the group?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah, so after commenting on that particular article in The Independent, Jo had seen my comment and reached out to me, and we struck up a conversation where we talked about our feelings about it and what we would like to do about what had happened. Specifically, our view has always been that we should be trying to do whatever we could to prevent other people from going through what we have.

**Lead Inquiry**: What did you have in mind in terms of how you would be able to prevent other people suffering what you and Ms Goodman had?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: We wanted systemic change. We wanted there to be a change in the attitude towards how things had been managed.

**Lead Inquiry**: Do you mean in terms of the care and support to people suffering from the disease, or the government and structural systems in place for the maintenance and care of our elderly and our ill? Describe something about how you saw change as being possible and how you intended it to be made.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Well, it's all of the above, for a start, and I think one of the things that needs to be mentioned is that some time earlier in the year, while I was still working, I can remember seeing what was happening on the news in China, and then Italy, and then Spain, as Covid crept ever closer to the UK, and wondering why nothing was being done about it.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. So you have identified there possible inaction on the part of the government.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: There certainly was inaction.

**Lead Inquiry**: Looking prospectively, looking to the future, though, has your group formed a view as to particular areas where you feel there was an inadequacy of protection, where people were let down in terms of the way in which they were looked after, either as members of society or having caught the disease? Where are the main areas of concern as you and your group see it?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: So, first and foremost, it's certainly to do with that element of not proactively having plans in place for this sort of world event.

**Lead Inquiry**: So the planning and preparedness, if you like, for a future pandemic or health emergency, the subject matter, in fact, of Module 1?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: What about in relation to hospitals and care homes? Have your members expressed concerns to you about the way in which, for example, in hospitals there were problems concerning infection control, communication between medical staff and family members of persons who were ill or dying?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah. There have been a number of things that have been -- that have been brought up. So obviously my own personal experience was to do with lockdowns. However, I'll point out that, although I'm grateful for the opportunity to have this conversation, the -- my experience doesn't encompass the experience of everybody, all of the bereaved, from Covid, experience. So there are many people that have many different things that they would like to add to this.

**Lead Inquiry**: Of course.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: So --

**Lead Inquiry**: Well, let's run through them.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Sure.

**Lead Inquiry**: So your group have expressed concerns to you about dealing, firstly, with hospitals, those aspects that I've mentioned, so --

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah, so --

**Lead Inquiry**: -- problems concerning testing for persons in hospital, infection control, the provision of PPE to hospital staff, the practices concerning ensuring that in-patients don't become infected, and the risks of infection, so nosocomial infection. Concerns about how, when persons were being treated in hospital, they're allowed access to, I don't know, workers and other people coming through wards and becoming infected. How procedures were put in place to stop them becoming infected if they were then discharged.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Other aspects of hospital care.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: So things that I have brought with me, so what I have been told is that hospital protocol at early stages was :outline:`hand washing` only, and patients were moved frequently between wards, which obviously increased exposure to infection. Often PPE was out of date, and not fit for purpose.

I have been told that at times some NHS workers were staying in tents in their gardens to try to avoid spreading infection to their loved ones. It sounds utterly tragic to me. It's not something that I think anybody should be -- had to have gone through.

There was poor communication generally between sort of central and hospitals. Often that was contradictory, it changed frequently, and a lot of the time apparently it made no sense to NHS workers.

**Lead Inquiry**: What about medical treatment? Have your members expressed concerns about aspects of treatment such as the availability of CPAP, continuous pressurised air devices, the use of and the apparently widespread use of DNACPR, do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation orders, or notices, and availability generally of :outline:`respirators` and ventilators in order to be able to maintain treatment? Are those also areas in which concern has been expressed?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Over the course of the organisation's existence, we've had obviously -- almost 7,000 people have come to us, who've joined us, and these are the sort of stories that we hear all of the time, and alarmingly these are stories that we were hearing right at the start of Covid and we were seeing repeated again and again as time went on. Seeing the same horror stories that people had experienced in April of 2020 then also happening at Christmas, and then happening again after Christmas, was frankly traumatic to all of us that are involved.

**Lead Inquiry**: I want to make it plain, Mr Fowler, your group has not jumped on a bandwagon, these were concerns being expressed to you and Ms Goodman from the very beginning, the beginning of the pandemic, and they're concerns which you then sought to highlight to become known more generally --

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- from then on?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: To begin with, Jo and I, when with started the organisation, we knew that we wanted to try and do something for change. At the time it was difficult to work out exactly what form that was going to take. People were coming to us, they felt that they had been abandoned by the government and left to deal with their bereavement on their own.

**Lead Inquiry**: Were you approached not just by patients who had been ill but had recovered, but family members who had lost loved ones, but also key workers, members of society who regarded themselves as being vulnerable or marginalised, also members of the ethnic communities, so from all walks of life?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah, so we have the organisation of -- by the structure of the organisation, if you like, we have regional branches for devolved nations, we have regional branches for different areas of the UK, and then we have sub-groups. We have several sub-groups that look at health and social care, key workers, people from other ethnic minorities that have been affected, which were disproportionately affected, and several other groups. We try to encompass as much of the pandemic's effect as we can, because it's important that all -- everything is looked at, we can't be allowing anybody to be left behind or anything that fall through the gaps.

**Lead Inquiry**: Therefore. Does your group also -- has it also concerned itself with other hospital-related issues such as inappropriate discharge without testing?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: Then, in relation to care homes, all the same issues again concerning PPE, medical support, the issue --

**Mr Matt Fowler**: There have been --

**Lead Inquiry**: -- of movement of staff and patients between hospitals and care homes and between care homes?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: There have been a lot of stories about care homes, and obviously it should come as no surprise that it was deeply traumatic to be told that apparently there was a protective ring thrown around the most vulnerable when it seemed in practicality that wasn't actually true.

There have been many differences between how some care homes have operated and others. In some, they had protocols in place to protect residents from pandemic flu, and lockdown two weeks before the national lockdown was announced, and provided private minibuses for staff. However, in other care homes they didn't seem to have any guidance at all and couldn't react because they genuinely didn't know what to do and how to go about it.

Clearly this is also affected by the way that agency workers were treated, whether or not they had the ability to take time away from work, and --

**Lead Inquiry**: And whether they were forced to work in multiple homes and therefore --

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Exactly.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- vehicles, if you like, of infection cross-sector between homes?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah, and that's without --

**Lead Inquiry**: Well, what about --

**Mr Matt Fowler**: -- talking about the way that test and trace had been abandoned very early on and, as you quite rightly said, in some cases Covid-positive patients were discharged to care homes or discharged to home without testing.

**Lead Inquiry**: What about the guidance then in place for visiting in care homes and hospitals and also the arrangements -- as you've described so terribly in relation to your own father, the arrangements for dealing with mortuary arrangements and burials and the like?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: In many cases visiting was prohibited in care homes, and I do know there are many of our members who are traumatised by the fact that they didn't get to see their loved ones in their last days, some of which -- I mean, I've heard some truly heartbreaking stories about loved ones with, like, dementia and things like that who would not have understood why suddenly they weren't being visited, and, I mean, that has been such a -- it's been heartbreaking for me to hear of these stories and it's been traumatic for the people that experienced them.

In my dad's case, we were offered the chance to have a phone call -- I say a phone call, a video call with my dad in hospital to say our goodbyes, which is something that I didn't take the hospital up on, as that's not how I want to remember my dad. Some of the last photos I had of him are him sitting in his hospital bed wearing his oxygen mask and I would prefer not to remember him like that and instead to remember him how he was in life.

**Lead Inquiry**: Many of your members expressed concerns about the way in which, when it came to take their departure from their loved ones, there were restrictions on the number of persons who could attend funerals and burials, and, of course, the aspect which you have already identified, of the way in which loved ones were dressed and cared for right up to the end?

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah. Those that we lost, we lost without dignity.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. Mr Fowler, that's very clear, thank you.

Finally, also, I should note and ask you to confirm that one of the matters into which your group as devoted itself and indeed campaigned long and hard for, here, was, of course, the setting up of this public inquiry, which --

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Yeah.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- was announced and formally opened, as we know, to Parliament and then this arena last June last year.

**Mr Matt Fowler**: Once it was established that this was a way to get the change that we wanted, we have campaigned relentlessly for it. It's been something that has been all-encompassing, it's taken up most of my life over the last three years. And don't get me wrong, it's not something I regret and I would do it again in a heartbeat if required.

Right from the get-go, Jo and I said that the important thing is change. We need to learn lessons, we need to learn about things that went wrong, and we need to put something in place to prevent those mistakes from being carried out again in the future. And those mistakes are many, ones that we've talked about here.

**Mr Keith**: Mr Fowler, thank you very much indeed for your help.

My Lady, those are all the questions that I wanted to ask.

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Fowler, I cannot understand the mentality of people who abused and threatened bereaved people like you. It is just -- it's plain cruel, it piles trauma on trauma, and I'm sorry there are people like that in the world.

Your father was obviously a very special man and his death a great loss to you, your family and by the sounds of it the local community. So you've done him honour in the work that you've done, and I promise that I will answer as many of the questions, and learn any lessons, as I can in the course of this Inquiry.

I see you have a number of notes, you have also written a full statement, and I promise -- don't worry on the way home if you haven't said something. I will make sure I take very much into account everything you said in your witness statement and of course anything that will be said in closing submissions by your counsel. So thank you very much for your help.

**The Witness**: Thank you, my Lady.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: I have been asked to break for ten minutes between the witnesses.
