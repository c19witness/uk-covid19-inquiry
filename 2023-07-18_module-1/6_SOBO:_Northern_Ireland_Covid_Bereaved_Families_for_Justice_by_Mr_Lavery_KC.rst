6. Submissions on Behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Lavery KC
====================================================================================================

**Mr Lavery**: Thank you, my Lady.

As your Ladyship knows, but for the benefit of everybody else, I appear for the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice and I make these submissions on behalf of those families, but I also endorse and commend the submissions that Mr Weatherby made to your Ladyship.

My Lady, you've heard all of the evidence now, and you've heard the evidence of Brenda Doherty today, who started off this module and finished this module as well, and in many ways she -- and I say this because of what I'm going to go on to say about Northern Ireland -- embodies what people in Northern Ireland can be proud of in terms of her means of articulation, her strength and her intelligence and her humanity.

My Lady, it was upsetting to hear how people in her position and the position of the other bereaved families have been vilified, but here, my Lady, and today they have been treated with the respect and dignity that they deserve.

Because these are articulate, reasonable, intelligent people, and they are typical of the group of people that we represent. And, like all of us, and like you, my Lady, we want the Inquiry to succeed in its task.

In many ways, Module 1 is the most important module. It's when we look at the resilience and preparedness. But in other ways, it's a work in progress, because it's really -- we are unable to see at this stage whether whatever plans were in place, however meagre they were, whether they were capable even of being implemented effectively, and that's what your Ladyship will look at in due course.

We are looking at this mainly from a Northern Ireland perspective in terms of preparedness and resilience, but there, of course, is a clear overlap with the themes that Mr Weatherby spelt out earlier. But by far -- and your Ladyship heard it from Brenda Doherty earlier -- what we want to impress upon you is the need for, and I'll try and say this properly, legislative change.

We say that the UK as a whole needs a new civil contingency legislative framework, but -- and we've heard Northern Ireland described as the poor relation -- we say whenever that's been formulated that that legislative scheme can't rely, unfortunately, on the devolved administration to either perform a legislative function or indeed to implement anything which is part of a legislative scheme. And the reasons for that are obvious: we've recurring and lengthy periods of no government, and the legislation which was supposed to be brought in in 2004 simply wasn't brought in in Northern Ireland.

We say, my Lady, that if legislation is brought in, there's a need for it to contemplate periods of time when no minister is in place, lengthy periods of time.

One solution might be an automatic reversion of these devolved powers, if they are devolved powers, to Westminster for civil contingencies generally and pandemic and resilience in particular. But so far, my Lady, the need for, in Northern Ireland, legislation has been summarised as that the duties of public authorities would be clearly set out. Accordingly, then, planning would be properly resourced, and there would be budgetary requirements which would follow that, and that there would be a plan, perhaps some kind of plan, for long periods of no government.

But we also say, and this mirrors in some respect what Mr Weatherby said earlier but we say that in a Northern Ireland specific context, that legislation should include binding obligations on the government minister, and accordingly a department, a corresponding department. This would lead to that department performing two key roles: firstly, ensuring that the minister is briefed in a proper and timely way; and, secondly, the department would then be obliged to seek the scientific advice which was so glaringly absent in Northern Ireland. We say as part of that scheme or otherwise that Northern Ireland should have an overall Chief Scientific Adviser, somebody like Sir Patrick Vallance, who performs that UK-wide role.

My Lady, your Ladyship heard in the evidence that the politicians said that they weren't briefed and the scientists said that they weren't asked, and that's where the department should and could step in.

Dr Kirchhelle, in his evidence, talked of the fluctuations in terms of resources and interest in pandemic planning, and we say, my Lady, that this points to a need for specifically designating by statute a minister with specific responsibility for civil contingency planning. We say that everybody should know who that person is. They should be easily identifiable, as easily as, for instance, the Finance Minister or the Health Minister, and we say this would go straight to transparency and accountability.

This, in Northern Irish terms, may well be the Executive Office, they already have responsibility under the current guidance, but it should be set out in statute and the people of Northern Ireland should know who they are, what department is responsible.

During the course of the evidence, it did become clear, and was accepted by Dr McMahon and others, including Michelle O'Neill, that Northern Ireland was at a disadvantage because of the legislative gaps.

My Lady, the value of this Inquiry we say is already demonstrated by the open and stated changes in position of some of the officials, for example, and if I dare mention it, the EU exit position, and there seems to be a clear consensus that that did have an overall negative impact, despite how it was initially put.

But, my Lady, in terms of legislative change and the legislative gaps in Northern Ireland, we say that putting Northern Ireland on the same level as the rest of the UK is now wouldn't be enough, and that's clear from what I've said already.

Mr Keith said to Dr McMahon that there were amber and red warning lights coming from the Cygnus report about care homes, and there was no legislation, no government, no accountable official or minister. We suggest, my Lady, that exercises like Cygnus should have a statutory footing so that they are carried out regularly, that they're comprehensive, and that there is at the very least a statutory obligation to have due regard to its findings.

The Department of Health and its inefficacy in the absence of ministers or statutory obligations has been sadly demonstrated by its inability to progress the Bengoa report. It's difficult to say whether that is just a failure on the part of the politicians or whether it points to a more structural problem.

My Lady, I've said this previously, the scale of the waiting list problem in Northern Ireland is mammoth, and one talks about waiting lists in Northern Ireland being longer than they are in other parts of the UK, but in some instances they are 50 times longer. This is a combination, I suppose, of UK-imposed austerity measures and a dysfunctional government in Northern Ireland.

Baroness Foster in her evidence suggested that the UK should intervene during periods of no government. Michelle O'Neill said that she was prioritising the implementation of Bengoa.

There's obviously a political overlay to any of these comments, my Lady, but we say that legislation could and should look at emergency planning on a five jurisdiction, two-island basis. This would ensure that there were no legislative inconsistencies or anomalies between the two jurisdictions. Anomalies or inconsistencies that might prevent partnership and co-operation which would be in the common good.

In terms of partnership with the Republic of Ireland, it doesn't need a treaty, the structures are already there within the rubric of the Good Friday -- Belfast Good Friday Agreement, Strand 2 are north-south bodies, co-operation Strand 3 is east-west. So structures are already in place to discuss and make sure that legislative schemes for contingencies are coherent.

We say, my Lady, that legislation would mitigate the impact of factors which prevented proper preparedness and resilience.

It would, through the legislative process and the legislative workstream, examine risks and preparedness. There would be an obligation, we say, as part of such legislation, on the department which was responsible to seek advice from scientists. Next, there should be an obligation to ensure that ministers are properly briefed. There would flow from that proper resourcing of the responsible public authorities, which would minimise the impact of austerity policies.

There would be proper designation of the responsible public authorities, and there would be a contingency for no government being in place in Northern Ireland.

We say that a proper legislative workstream would ensure that the human impact of a pandemic is contemplated and built into the response plan. We say that there should be a formal structure to ensure that Northern Ireland is properly plugged in to the all-UK science network, that meetings aren't a tick box exercise, nor a simple communication of what is to be done coming from London.

Legislative framework should incorporate exercises like Cygnus into legislative obligations, first of all to make sure that such exercises are carried out, and, secondly, that the recommendations are properly taken into account.

Perhaps not part of that, but certainly in terms of legislative change, this will come as no surprise, the lack of regulation of care homes is a matter of utmost concern to our families, my Lady, and, as you heard today, regulation of end of life care, whether it's appropriate or not to regulate that, whether it's within the statutory framework and how the whole question of communication is dealt with in that context.

My Lady, we will face another pandemic, and we say that the work needs to start now. And when I say "now", I mean after Module 1. That is clearly necessary to prevent a lack of protection of the most vulnerable in society, a lack of containment, a lack of ability to prevent the spread of disease and death and, my Lady, to prevent the suffering and the indignity and, to use a phrase I used in my opening, the dehumanisation and re-traumatisation that happened in the circumstances of lockdown.

Those are my closing submissions, my Lady, and they'll be amplified in due course and be more detailed in terms of our written submissions.

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Very grateful, Mr Lavery, and obviously, as with anybody's written closing submissions, I'll read them all with great care. I'm very grateful to you.

**Mr Lavery**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: I think I've been asked to break now before we turn to, I think it's Ms Heaven next -- I can't see her -- wherever she is. I shall return at 25 to.

**Lady Hallett**: Right. Now, Ms Heaven, I'm told you've moved.

**Ms Heaven**: Yes, I'm here. Thank you.
