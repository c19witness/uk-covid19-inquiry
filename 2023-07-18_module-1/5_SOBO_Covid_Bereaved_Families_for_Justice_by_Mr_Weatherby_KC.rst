5. Submissions on Behalf of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Weatherby KC
==================================================================================

**Mr Weatherby**: Thank you very much.

Woefully inadequate was the assessment of

Matt Hancock, former Health Secretary, of the state of preparedness of the United Kingdom at the outset of the pandemic. Wholly inadequate was the phrase used by Bruce Mann and Professor Alexander, the experts chosen to assist the Inquiry. The 2019 National Security Risk

Assessment assessed the likelihood of the emergence of a dangerous newly emerging infectious disease as moderate, with a reasonable worst-case scenario of 200 deaths and 2,000 casualties.

But as we noted in opening, in 2015 then Prime Minister David Cameron warned in a major speech to the G7 that the world needed to consider the possibility of the emergence of a new disease with a fatality rate of Ebola and the transmissibility of measles. It's difficult to square that with a reasonable worst-case scenario of 200 deaths.

Way beyond the headlines, we know this was not the stuff of science fiction to epidemiologists and virologists. Professor Whitty told the Inquiry he was involved in drafting so-called "golden hour" SAGE guidance, produced at some point between 2013 and 2017, which dealt with an emergency involving a non-flu emerging disease. That guidance recognised the following nine points:

One, that such a disease might have a range of characteristics affecting the mode and rate of transmission.

Two, it was unlikely that existing antivirals would be effective.

Three, there had been multiple cases of emergent infectious diseases with pandemic potential which had arisen within the previous century, and that they were usually zoonotic, jumping to humans from other animal species.

Four, the most likely scenario was based on SARS, which was contained by barrier nursing, isolation and contact tracing, and Ebola, which was not :outline:`airborne`. But the reasonable worst-case scenario was based upon smallpox, a respiratory virus, with a fatality rate of 40%.

Five, the possibility of asymptomatic transmission was clearly flagged.

Six, that it might be possible to prevent an emerging disease pandemic from entering the UK, and there were possible measures to slow its spread if it did, including restrictions on assemblies, school closures and home isolation.

Seven, the availability of diagnostic testing including for the asymptomatic.

Eight, that the capacity of the healthcare system was an important resilience factor.

Nine, the need to identify particularly vulnerable groups and to recognise that transport systems would be a likely source of exposure to infection and that transport workers would be particularly vulnerable.

That was pre-2017. None of the national risk assessments or any plans addressed the need to try to prevent or slow the spread of an emerging disease hitting the UK. None of them referred to the likely different characteristics of the new disease or the mitigating measures mentioned to combat it. None of them reflected the reasonable worst-case scenario used in the golden hour guidance.

The purpose of the golden hour guidance was to assist SAGE once it was set up as the emergency happened. All rather too late, shutting the stable door. The thinking was all there but not within the risk assessments or any planning.

Professor Whitty also said that he had warned of the possibility of a dangerous non-flu pandemic in a seminar in 2018. In evidence Professor Woolhouse noted, somewhat alarmingly, that, bad as Covid was, that it could have been worse and that the next pandemic may well be.

Dr Horton from The Lancet produced the 2004 Institute of Medicine report from the United States that warned of the real threat of new coronaviruses, and he confirmed that this was a subject well trodden within the scientific community globally.

Coronaviruses were no longer just the common cold but were becoming increasingly dangerous, with SARS and, later, MERS being examples and warnings.

The real question for the Inquiry is therefore not if the United Kingdom was as prepared as could reasonably be expected, but why it was so catastrophically unprepared, given the warnings.

Plainly the failure to prepare and plan for Covid is not just a matter of history, because all of those warnings remain as prescient today as they ever were. In considering recommendations we urge the Inquiry not to consider this the post Covid age but the relative calm before the next pandemic. That prospect calls for swift and bold recommendations. Big changes need to be made. Or as Bruce Mann and Professor Alexander agreed with Mr Keith, there is a need for a wholesale rewriting of the United Kingdom's strategic approach to pandemics.

The Inquiry should make recommendations as soon as possible and in tune with other recent successful Inquiries, including the Manchester Arena Inquiry, it should return to its recommendations as it deals with other aspects of its work, and it should call witnesses back to make sure recommendations have been fully considered in a timely way and implemented where appropriate. To some of the people we've heard from, carrying learning into practice will be a novel experience.

We've heard evidence that there were ministers involved in resilience, and there were many civil servants in the Cabinet Office and beyond whose duties related to civil emergencies. We have seen the spaghetti charts entitled "Pandemic preparedness and response structures in the UK" and similar charts for each of the devolved nations and jurisdictions. There was no shortage of committees, teams, partnerships, divisions, authorities and groups. Indeed, acronyms too.

We've heard evidence from a range of very eminent scientists and there were a number of scientific advisory groups, and of course SAGE. So the Inquiry might conclude that there was no lack of effort expended in this area, but efforts which resulted in this woefully inadequate level of preparedness.

So what was missing?

Firstly, although there were ministers involved, there was no single point of responsibility in central government for civil emergencies or resilience or preparedness. The captain wasn't so much missing from the wheelhouse as there simply was no captain.

Secondly, what appears to have been the hub of central government preparedness, the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, had no actual responsibilities and no actual organisational role or powers. It operated on an ad hoc basis, in a liaison role between disparate parts of government.

Despite its industry, what did it actually achieve? If it had been paused or abolished, what difference would it have made to the state of pandemic planning as at January 2020?

The legal framework, as we have seen, contained duties only on first and second responders. There were and remain no central government duties save insofar as the Department of Health is classed as a responder. Yes, ministers had regard to some aspects of preparedness or resilience, but none bore significant responsibility.

The senior Cabinet Office managers were at pains to emphasise that no actual responsibilities fell on them. Oh no. The reason, we were told, because the system was based on localism and subsidiarity. A convenient and alluring Get Out of Jail Free card when things go wrong, based on a concept most of us would probably applaud.

We certainly do not suggest that there should be anything other than a strong emphasis on the local delivery of any emergency response. Although there may be many valid criticisms of the way in which this happens in practice, and in the lack of resourcing, localism is not the problem in principle. The problem is the absence of national responsibility and a national framework to make the system work, to ensure resourcing, training, guidance are in place, to ensure central government departments work in tandem with localism and, perhaps above all, to assure the system.

Assurance means an evidence-based scheme whereby minimum standards and consistency and compliance can be audited and proven. With respect to pandemics, there is a need for national and international collaboration on many fronts. To pretend that responsibility can be left to individual local responders and local resilience forums is and always was a dangerous nonsense.

To pretend that the Civil Contingencies Secretariat or its 2023 replacement is a body that can fill the gap through liaison and co-ordination is equally dangerous.

To suggest that voluntary standards and the self-assessment of local bodies provides some kind of assurance is a pure fiction. It does no such thing. There remains no auditing or assurance of civil emergency preparedness at either local or national level. That must change.

The national element of the civil emergencies framework appears to have consisted of two key elements: the formulation of national risk assessments or national security risk assessments and the National Risk Register signed off by the National Security Adviser and the National Security Council; and the ownership of each of the assessed threats and hazards by different lead government departments. Ownership in this context meaning responsibility.

With respect to both pandemic flu and outbreaks of dangerous emerging diseases, it's far from clear how these hazards were assessed either in terms of the likelihood of their occurrence or, indeed, their impact.

Given the warnings about the threat of new coronaviruses, the experience of some of them and the golden hour guidance I've already referred to, it is perhaps more than perplexing that the National Risk Assessment system came to the conclusion that the threat from a newly emerging disease was only moderate. It is more than remarkable that it repeatedly concluded that the reasonable worst-case scenario was 200 deaths, and I remind that this was not the most likely impact for the reasonable worst-case scenario.

We know that this was hopelessly wrong by a factor of well over 1,000. As we all well know, there were not 200 deaths, but officially well over 228,000 deaths. And counting. 184 people died of Covid across the UK during the week ending 13 July.

There are really two possibilities here: either the pandemic was a black swan event which no one could have foreseen or the basis for the risk assessments requires the closest of scrutiny and change.

The experts expressly discounted any suggestion of Covid being a black swan event. The evidence shows that it was not only foreseeable but actually foreseen.

So far as we can see, there is no document, no significant witness evidence as to the evidential basis for the series of risk assessments, so it's not clear why all the warnings and evidence were not heeded. Perhaps those who did the assessments were fixated on what had gone before: Ebola, which had largely been confined to Western and Central Africa, and SARS and MERS, which had largely been contained elsewhere. If that is the explanation, it was predicting the last war, not the next one.

What we do know is that the Hine review questioned the basis of reasonable worst-case scenario. What is the concept based on? A decade or more later, the Cabinet Office commissioned a Royal Academy of Engineers' report and the Mann and Alexander evidence has repeated the point: risk assessments need a range of scenarios, not a guess as to what the worst reasonable outcome might be.

Similarly, the Blackett report of 2011 emphasised that the focus should be on impact, not likelihood, a point seemingly adopted by Mr Letwin. Once a threat is identified as one which is likely to occur at some indeterminate point, what's the relevance of guessing whether it will be next year or next decade, and how can you ever do so? The point is the identification of a threat must lead to action now because it might happen next year or next decade.

Then there's the evidence of Sir Mark Walport that in 2013 he was arguing that the UK needed to concentrate on prevention and mitigation, not just responding to the dire impacts seen on risk assessments.

Going forward, these three points need to change the way risk assessments are considered.

We've heard from a variety of eminent scientists, we're told that the UK is a country of scientific excellence. We have no reason to disagree. If it's accepted that the National Risk Assessment was hopelessly wrong concerning the impact of a newly emerging disease pandemic, and it must, if it's accepted that the UK is a centre of scientific excellence, and we do, and if it's accepted that Covid was not a black swan event, then the inevitable conclusion is that there was a disconnect between scientific advice and foresight and the national risk assessments.

Much has been said about SAGE and its efficacy. SAGE is not a standing committee, it's an emergency process to stand up whatever bespoke panel of experts is required to respond to an emergency as it arises. It's not designed to advise government on risk assessment.

There are, of course, a myriad of other scientific advisory groups which might be able to contribute to the assessment of threats and hazards. NERVTAG, for example. However, none of them appear to have responsibilities regarding the national risk assessments as a core role or term of reference, nor specific responsibility for advising or critiquing plans devised to meet the threats. Why not?

It's worth noting that NERVTAG, to stay with that pertinent example, because it advises on newly merging respiratory virus threats, has what is described in its terms of reference as a "responsive role", and therefore meets only on an ad hoc basis, albeit at least annually, and its members are volunteers and unpaid.

Since the pandemic, as we heard from Professor Woolhouse, amongst others, the Scottish Government has established its Standing Committee on Pandemic Preparedness, SCoPP. Its role is to respond to commissions from the devolved government but also to act on its own initiative and highlight matters which it considers should be dealt with. The evidence shows that it meets regularly and autonomy is written into its terms of reference. Isn't this a common sense approach to dealing with scientific advice and scientific monitoring needed for identifying threats and hazards, that is national risk assessments, and for informing resilience planning and preparedness?

If there had been such a dedicated scientific advisory body advising on and challenging the national risk assessments, would the threat of emerging diseases have been assessed as it was? Would the fact that 2011 pandemic flu strategy was so deficient, or the fact that there was no whole-system plan or plan for non-flu pandemics, have been allowed to persist for nearly a decade? Would the fact that such planning as there was did not address prevention or mitigation measures to contain or slow the spread of a pandemic disease have been ignored? We think not.

If the first task of the national framework is identification of threats and hazards through national risk assessments, what about the other side of the coin, planning and preparedness to meet those challenges? We know from the Cabinet Office evidence that the model or doctrine for planning for identified National Risk Assessment threats and hazards was, and appears to remain, ownership of them by lead government departments.

Yes, of course the department with responsibility for health must be expected to play a leading role in preparedness for a pandemic, but in our view it's a flawed model to delegate responsibility or ownership of a civil emergency threat to a particular department on the basis that the context of the emergency falls within the remit of the department.

The pandemic threat, like other national emergencies, requires a whole-system approach to both planning and response. Yes, that will include a substantial role for hospitals, the social care sector, public health bodies, but a threat assessed to kill 800,000 citizens on a reasonable worst-case scenario was very obviously going to require a fully co-ordinated, cross-government, intergovernment, vertical and horizontal series of plans. It hardly bears repeating, because it has been a constant theme of the evidence, but there was no whole-system plan, there was an out of date single department plan for pandemic flu which contained no more than a cursory nod to the role of other departments. There was no plan for other pandemics beyond a vague hope expressed within the flu plan that it could be adaptable with no further guidance as to how that could be done.

As a general comment, although many witnesses have come to this Inquiry with candour and to assist its purpose, others have shown a single-minded determination to protect their legacy, their reputation and to pretend that any shortcomings in the state of preparedness and resilience as at January 2020 made little difference to outcome, or that other countries did not do any better.

The lack of frankness was nowhere so apparent as with issues of capacity and austerity. Without an overall plan, with a dysfunctional civil emergencies framework, with no one at the helm, and with little evidence of meaningful joined-up collaboration between national officials and local responders, with zero responsibility on the former and zero assurance on the latter, and little evidence of planning co-ordination between the United Kingdom Government and the three devolved administrations, at least in terms of structures, this was a system which was never going to be effective.

But further to problems with the system itself, the issue of capacity was critical to the success of any planning. A number of the experts and eminent witnesses who worked within the system have highlighted that the lack of capacity in health and social care and public health, with huge cuts to devolved and local authority budgets over the relevant period, underpinned systemic failures. A lack of capacity means less resilience. A shortage of healthcare staff and full bed occupancy in normal times is not an NHS which can easily surge and pivot into emergency mode. How was that allowed to happen in one of the most wealthy countries on the planet?

Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne were happy to tell us their views on austerity, but somewhat less forthcoming on its effects. Mr Hunt was keen to tell us that the number of doctors and nurses went up under his stewardship, but less keen to talk about overall capacity. The really revealing statistic had in fact already been given by his Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, who told us that the UK was bottom of the table of comparable countries with regard to the numbers of doctors and nurses.

Witness after witness has stressed the capacity issues in health and social care. Professors Marmot and Bambra have noted the reductions in funding for health and social care were concurrent with widening health inequalities. Others have stressed that the resilience relies on a proper base, a proper functioning health service and social care sector. Witnesses have referred to the fact that the NHS struggles to survive each winter. In 2018 routine operations were cancelled to protect essential emergency healthcare services, and it regularly runs at over 95% bed occupancy.

The structural problems in social care are well known, and in that sector there was even a lack of understanding of the number of care facilities at the outset of the pandemic, and the interface between hospitals and care homes will be a major issue in forthcoming modules.

Major cuts to local authority funding during the relevant period had affected adult social care and early days nursery provision. If our services struggle to maintain business as usual, what chance do we have when there's a looming disaster like a pandemic?

The rights and wrongs of austerity, whether Mr Osborne really did fix the roof while the sun was shining, are not for this Inquiry. Resource allocation is for the democratic institutions of state and elections. But the degrading of capacity through the relevant period, major budget cuts to local and devolved authorities, are for this Inquiry, because they are directly relevant to resilience. The Inquiry should say so.

Mr Letwin's evidence was different, more reflective, and it did seek to address some of the issues before the Inquiry, rather than defending a position or legacy of office. No doubt his views will assist you regarding the need for responsibility for resilience and preparedness at the centre of government, but also the need to concentrate on preparing for foreseeable adverse impact rather than the probability of an event happening. That is a simple but important point I mentioned earlier.

It's perhaps regrettable that Mr Letwin had not driven those changes and spoken out when he was a senior figure in government during the relevant period.

Then there was Mr Gove. He highlighted the successes of the preparations for no-deal Brexit and he was asked about the fact that it brought to light supply chain issues which were or might have been relevant to Covid. He emphasised that there was a knock-on positive effect in providing a rehearsal for another major civil emergency. We do not doubt that there were positives to come out of the near miss no-deal civil emergency, but the trade-off was that most of the work started on refreshing pandemic preparedness after Cygnus was paused and attention was deflected from it in a period where multiple problems and deficits could have been remedied.

One further comment on the evidence of ministers is the striking feature of a collective abdication of their responsibility as leaders to ensure pandemic preparedness during the relevant decade, and the failure to acknowledge even now that austerity and the spectre of no-deal Brexit had severe adverse consequences on resilience in particular but also pandemic preparedness as a whole.

I have already alluded to the Marmot and Bambra evidence regarding widening health inequalities during the austerity years. As you know, there is real and widespread concern not only amongst bereaved families regarding the disproportionate number of Covid deaths within black and ethnic minority communities and the failure to recognise structural and institutional racism within pandemic planning. Given that structural and institutional discrimination, now so well recognised, and given that health inequalities are so well known, why was so little attention paid to the disproportionate effects of pandemics and disease on particular ethnic communities or particular vulnerable sections of society?

The fact that a virus does not respect borders or the colour of your football team or your politics is a given, but it does not follow that the statistical chance of contracting a virus or the severity of its impact is equally indiscriminate. The uncomfortable reality is that race, class, disability, sexual orientation and other characteristics are all matters which may affect impact. This is not inevitable. It is the product of structures not individual choice.

As such, they must be considered as an integral part of planning.

Further to that, Marmot and Bambra highlight the lack of data regarding disparities in health outcomes and longevity on ethnic lines. Without data, empirical evidence, it's difficult to understand the causes and granular effects of discrimination and plan to combat it. It was obvious that in some highly vulnerable sectors, frontline healthcare and transport being prominent amongst them, the proportion of ethnic minority workers was far higher than in the general population, and it's well documented that many black and brown communities are more socially disadvantaged than the average.

It's a shocking fact that most doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff who died from Covid were from ethnic minorities, not only a disproportionate number but an actual majority.

Other factors relating to vaccine take-up, including trust in authority within ethnic minority communities, plainly required to be planned for and managed too. In so-called excess death management, there was little regard and no guidance for the dignity needs of particular communities. There's scant evidence of planning to combat structural disability discrimination or to combat disproportionate impacts on people with other protected characteristics. In the light of the evidence regarding the failure to combat the disproportionate effect of pandemic on particular ethnic minority communities, there is a need for specific responsibility for all local and national pandemic planning to set out action plans as to how such discrimination is to be challenged.

Furthermore, there is a need to recognise the failure of specialist equality units and the Equality and Human Rights Commission to make an impact in this regard. It is not that there was insufficient regard to discrimination and inequalities within pandemic planning, it is much worse than that. There is hardly any reference to these issues in the plans, guidance or exercises.

Turning to the devolved administrations, Mr Lavery will deal with the complex and different issues relating to Northern Ireland, and I know what he is to say and endorse it in advance.

It appears to us that there are at least three key and common themes regarding pandemic planning and the relationship with the UK administration.

Firstly, there are differing accounts of personal relationships between ministers in particular, no doubt driven by political differences and imperatives, and a lack of structures to fully involve the devolved administrations in UK planning.

Secondly, there are constraints on the ability of the devolved systems to ensure resilience by the limited central resources allocated to them.

Thirdly, there appears to have been a reliance on both the UK threat assessments and the pandemic flu plan in all the devolved jurisdictions rather than a critical consideration of them. The planning assumptions were not challenged, there was no plan B on flu, and what planning there was related to consequences, not prevention.

We will expand on these themes in our written closing submissions, but the overarching learning from the Module 1 evidence with respect to the devolved administrations is the need for better and more formal structures within which intergovernmental civil emergency planning can take place with a genuine spirit of collaboration and dialogue, rather than diktat from Westminster.

If there was a UK civil emergencies minister, the single point of responsibility might also aid this cross-administration collaboration, but without such structures the evidence indicates that some UK ministers saw co-operation with the devolved administrations as of limited importance, and saw meetings as an opportunity to communicate decisions taken rather than to reach consensus and agreement.

The current approach of tagging on general intergovernmental ministerial responsibility to the Department for Levelling Up portfolio is manifestly insufficient. From the evidence, it's plain that the UK administration can itself gain much from collaboration with the devolved administrations. The SCoPP in Scotland may well be an important example.

Finally, we urge this Inquiry to make the following nine recommendations:

One, that there should be a senior minister within government who is the single point of responsibility for civil emergency resilience and planning. The buck stops with them, and that is an important driver to making sure things are done and optimised.

Two, there should be a whole-system plan for each group of threats or hazards identified on the National Risk Assessment.

Three, the legal framework should be reformed so that the duties on first and second responders are mirrored by duties at national level. This would mean that a central government department responsible to the minister would have actual responsibility for national risk assessments, for the whole-system plan, and to co-ordinate individual, departmental and other plans which are necessary to the whole-system approach. This department should also have responsibility for clear intergovernmental structures with the devolved administrations and for policies and guidance necessary to support local resilience forums and other local responders, and for setting national standards and training competencies and for assuring local performance. It should be responsible for a running programme of exercises to rehearse and challenge plans against foreseen scenarios, together with a clear programme to analyse real emergencies and exercises and an audited programme of putting learning into practice.

Four, there should be an independent UK standing scientific committee on pandemics, with terms of reference to advise those formulating the National Risk Assessment and to challenge where necessary, and to advise government on resilience and preparedness for pandemics. The Scottish model would appear to be a good starting point.

Five, there should be a duty on all who hold responsibilities regarding resilience and planning or advising on the same to raise with the minister any issues of capacity or resourcing which might impact on the ability of the UK to optimise its response to a pandemic. Civil emergency plans should expressly deal with the issue of resourcing and capacity, given the importance these issues have assumed in the evidence in this Inquiry.

Six, there should be a people-first approach, with duties placed on both local responders and at the national level to require the integration of community and voluntary groups into civil emergency plans, to require positive community engagement with transparent public communication, and public consultation regarding threats and planned mitigations.

Seven, all civil emergency plans should incorporate clear statements indicating how they will combat the effects of structural and institutional racism, other forms of structural discrimination relating to protected characteristics, the effects of health inequalities, and how they will protect vulnerable persons.

Eight, there should be a clear national policy regarding data gathering and analysis relating to civil emergency planning and response, addressing and resolving the perceived barriers arising from regulation.

And, nine, openness and candour. The default position should be that national risk assessments, together with their methodology and the evidence base behind them, and all civil emergency plans, should be published unless there are clear national security reasons why they must remain closed. Risk assessments and plans can only be challenged and improved if there's transparency, a point powerfully made by Professor Alexander.

As we heard with respect to Exercise Cygnus and Alice, only the threat of judicial review proceedings by a doctor brought the shortcomings in the system into the public domain, and only well after Covid had arrived. Mark Lloyd was frustrated that the culture of secrecy prevented the Local Government Association from knowing of the learning from exercises. Secrecy hides failure. In this context, failure is and was measured in lost lives.

Those are our submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Extremely helpful, Mr Weatherby, thank you very much indeed.

Mr Lavery.
