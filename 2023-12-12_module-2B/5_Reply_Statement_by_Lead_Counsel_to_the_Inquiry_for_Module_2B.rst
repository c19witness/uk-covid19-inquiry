5. Reply Statement by Lead Counsel to the Inquiry for Module 2B
===============================================================

**Mr Poole**: My Lady, may I briefly attempt just to deal with four issues which, in our submission, require to be responded to and can be usefully dealt with straightaway.

The first, delayed disclosure. As I said earlier this morning, we have received everything that we anticipate receiving and we will provide material to core participants as soon as possible, which inevitably is probably going to tip into the New Year.

As regards the three statements specifically mentioned by Ms Heaven on behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru, namely the statements from the First Minister, Mr Drakeford, Mr Gething and Eluned Morgan, they will be disclosed before Christmas, failing which very early in the New Year, and they are all at the final review stage.

The second issue, informal communications. Again, in response to submissions made on behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru, I can confirm that the Rule 9 questions that were in the Rule 9 sent out by Module 2B team included questions on informal WhatsApps and other messaging platforms, texts and iMessages.

As regards the issue of retention and deletion, we are reviewing, as I said earlier, the recent response received from the Welsh Government regarding the use of WhatsApps and other informal methods of communication, and the CPs can rest assured that we will pursue the issue until we are satisfied that the issue is fully investigated, and we will provide an update on this issue to core participants in due course. And of course --

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry to interrupt you, I think Ms Heaven also mentioned Public Health Wales in relation to deleted messages.

**Mr Poole**: My Lady, yes, I include --

**Lady Hallett**: You do?

**Mr Poole**: -- Public Health Wales within that, and we will provide an update to core participants in respect of all of those in due course. We will also, of course, provide the materials when we can.

The third issue I wanted to mention was list of issues and Rule 9 recipients. In response to submissions made by Mr Straw KC on behalf of John's Campaign and Care Rights UK, the Inquiry is very alive to the issues that Mr Straw has identified. We will reflect on the specific issues when putting together the evidence proposals before circulating to core participants for their input. We will also consider the individuals and bodies that he's identified and reflect on whether further Rule 9s should be issued, and I can confirm that the Inquiry has already sent a Rule 9 request to Professor Debbie Foster.

Then, finally, on the provisional list of witnesses and evidence proposals, I can confirm that the core participants will be given the opportunity to provide their comments on the provisional list of witnesses in advance of that list being finalised. We hope to be able to share that list with core participants this week, and we welcome their observations in due course, and we will also write very early in the New Year to core participants explaining the timetable for evidence proposals and core participant contributions.

My Lady, they're all my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Very grateful, Mr Poole, and indeed I'm extremely grateful to everyone who's made submissions today and indeed anybody who's made submissions in writing in the past, it all bodes extremely well for an effective investigation in February and March. The focus and the constructive nature of the submissions are very welcome. So thank you all very much indeed.

I'm afraid my Welsh isn't good enough to say I look forward to seeing you in February and March, but maybe you can give me some lessons, Ms Heaven or Mr Howells. Actually I think I have somebody in the Inquiry who can give me lessons.

Thank you all, and I will rise now until 1.45, when

I'm going to start the Module 2C preliminary hearing.

Anyway, for those who need to know, we'll make sure

a message is there.

Thank you.

*(11.35 am)*
