2. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru by Ms Heaven
=====================================================================================

**Ms Heaven**: Good morning, my Lady, thank you.

As you know, I represent the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru, and it will come as no surprise to the Inquiry that the majority of my submissions this morning will relate to the linked issues of delayed disclosure and what appears to be the deletion or loss by the Welsh Government of highly relevant communications between members of the Welsh Government and its advisers, including but not necessarily limited to WhatsApp message. Time permitting, I'll briefly touch upon a number of other issues. But can I start by saying that these submissions do not in any way call into question the efforts the Inquiry has made and is continuing to make on behalf of the Welsh bereaved.

Now, the first issue, as I've indicated, relates to delayed disclosure by the Welsh Government in relation to this Inquiry in Module 2B, and as my Lady knows this hearing was scheduled to take place on 16 November. CTI's written update for this hearing was prepared now some six weeks ago, on 30 October 2023, and it's important to note that at that stage, so in other words at the end of October, core participants were being told that the Welsh Government had delayed in the provision of certain responses to your Rule 9 requests, and that your CTI's level of concern was such that core participants were being told that this delayed disclosure has the potential to disrupt the Inquiry's process notice they are quickly resolved.

Now, we learn today from your Counsel to the Inquiry, Mr Poole KC, that certain draft statements contained insufficient detail or did not address all the matters raised in the Rule 9 requests, and that there were failures to respond sufficiently quickly, necessitating repeated requests for extension of deadlines.

Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru are extremely disappointed to learn today that some of the delays and extensions relate to the Welsh Government.

Now, it is important to note that the Welsh Government in their written response to your Counsel to the Inquiry's note of 30 October was unfortunately not in any way apologetic for these delays, but apparently -- certainly at least from the perspective of the Welsh bereaved -- it seemed to be rather defensive, pointing out what had been disclosed rather than being clear on what had not been disclosed.

Certainly, in that response, there appeared to be in acknowledgement by the Welsh Government of the impact of delayed disclosure on the ability of core participants to effectively participate in this Inquiry. We are now some six weeks ahead of that CTI note of the end of October, and some 11 weeks before the commencement of Module 2C, and core participants still do not have anywhere near full disclosure from the Welsh Government.

My Lady, of course those whom I represent fully understand that your Inquiry has very important processes that must be adhered to before you can disclose any material. So, to be clear, core participants still do not have Module 2B witness statements from many significant witnesses, to name a few: First Minister for Wales, Mark Drakeford, Vaughan Gething, and Eluned Morgan. So the bereaved non-state core participants are facing a situation in Module 2B not dissimilar to that faced in Module 1 where the Welsh Government also delayed in providing certain key disclosure right up until the last minute, which delayed onwards disclosure to core participants by the Inquiry.

Now, the Welsh bereaved are understandably asking: how could this have happened? Because as you know, my Lady, in the early days of this Inquiry, the Cymru group, the UK Government, the Senedd and this Inquiry received repeated assurances from the First Minister for Wales, Mark Drakeford, and the Welsh Government that they were committed to fully engaging with this Inquiry, and these assurances were repeated after Module 1. And I do just want to repeat again what Mr Drakeford said to the Right Honourable Boris Johnson MP when he was Prime Minister, when he announced the Inquiry. So Mr Drakeford said the following:

"... I would invite you to agree that all public bodies engaging with the Inquiry are expected to consider themselves under a duty of candour. That duty should drive their culture of engagement with the Inquiry and should lead to prompt and comprehensive disclosure of all relevant material to the Inquiry. A duty of candour should also guide the way the public body witnesses should approach the Inquiry."

So the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru ask the Welsh Government to explain: where is this prompt disclosure that they promised way back in November 2021?

With that in mind, can I now turn to the issue of non-disclosure and deletion or loss of other forms of informal communication, including but not necessarily limited to WhatsApp messages.

Now, as we know, with a few notable exceptions, significant volumes of WhatsApp messages were retained and disclosed to this Inquiry by the UK Government in Module 2. These contemporaneous notes and messages between civil servants, special advisers, scientists and politicians have played a key role in illuminating how and why political and administrative decisions were made by the UK Government.

It was therefore very surprising, and indeed concerning, to learn from your Counsel to the Inquiry's update note of 30 October that only very limited WhatsApp messages and text messages had been disclosed to the Inquiry by the Welsh Government as at that date, and that several individual witnesses within the Welsh Government had apparently deleted or simply lost WhatsApp messages from the relevant period.

My Lady, can I start by making a request for a bit more clarity from the Inquiry as to what exactly the Inquiry have requested the Welsh Government and their advisers and whether the request for disclosure extends to all forms of informal communications to include not just WhatsApp but other platforms such as Signal, Telegram, Discord, MS Teams chat, iMessage, Facebook Messenger. This appears to have been the case in respect of requests to the Scottish Government, which were outlined by your Counsel to the Inquiry in the recent Module 2A preliminary hearing, and we're assuming that the same rigorous approach has been adopted in relation to Wales.

I now turn to the Welsh Government's written response to this Inquiry on the WhatsApp non-disclosure issue, this is the written response of 16 November. Now, the Welsh Government in their defence state that searching for WhatsApp text material is, in their words, time consuming, demanding of resources and technically problematic, and the word "complex" is also used.

My Lady, the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru were staggered by this response. The Welsh Government have had more than sufficient time to find, preserve and disclose these informal communications in a timely fashion. The Inquiry needs no reminding of the timelines, but the key dates are placed on record for the avoidance of any doubt. Counsel to the Inquiry's October update noted that the Welsh Government committed to providing WhatsApps and related material in June 2023. However, in fairness to the Inquiry, the expectation that this material would be disclosable arose much earlier, and as you well know, my Lady, on 20 January 2022 you wrote a letter to the Director General of Propriety and Ethics at the Cabinet Office on record retention, and you clearly stated that:

"I would ask that each department and Devolved Administration takes steps to ensure that the same approach to record retention is communicated throughout all relevant bodies, including arm's-length bodies and any other bodies exercising public functions. Namely that they ensure that a full and clear record of their part in events exists, is accessible, and that they apply a precautionary principle by retaining all material that could be relevant -- including emails, text or WhatsApp messages and other communications."

The response you received from the Director General in February 2022 indicated that he'd written to all permanent secretaries in June 2021 about preservation of material and that they were written to again, including the devolved administrations, in February 2022, with assurances being given to you that "well-established records management processes are in place across government".

The public were told in an Inquiry update note for Module 2B that -- in October 2022 -- a corporate statement had been requested from the Welsh Government, and we note today that your CTI, Mr Poole KC, has confirmed that it was in this request that went to the Welsh Government that the request was made for informal messaging. So that's October 2022.

So in short, the Welsh Government have been on notice for over two years, and probably longer, that they needed to retain, seize and disclose all informal messaging to the Inquiry. The Welsh Government have been in receipt of a formal request for disclosure of this material for 14 months. It therefore is extremely surprising and disappointing that the Inquiry has only very recently, a matter of weeks ago, received this disclosure.

There is an obvious point to make here, and I appreciate it's been made a number of times on behalf of my client, but it's an important one, but it was Mr Drakeford himself, when refusing to hold a Welsh public inquiry, who insisted that the Welsh Government be scrutinised alongside the UK Government. Now the UK Government has disclosed significant volumes of WhatsApp communications, and so the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru query: if the Welsh Government want parity of scrutiny, why have they not made similar disclosure in a timely manner?

To be clear, as at today's date, the core participants in Module 2B have not received a single WhatsApp from the Welsh Government.

I now turn to the deletion or the loss of relevant material by members of the Welsh Government, in relation to informal messaging.

Now, the First Minister for Wales, Mark Drakeford, said at First Minister's questions on 7 November 2023 on this issue that:

"... as soon as we knew that the Inquiry wanted something, there's no deletion beyond that point. However, during the COVID period itself, many colleagues working for the Welsh Government will have had devices with deletion instructions already on them, and those things may have remained on their phones, because at the point nobody, I think -- absolutely nobody -- was focused on whether those messages might be required at some future distant point."

The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru are appalled that the Welsh Government has indefensibly allowed a situation in which relevant communications were either lost or deleted. They question whether it can be the case that nobody focused on the preservation of messages during the pandemic. Well, before the pandemic, it would have been obvious, indeed a requirement, that informal messaging touching upon matters of government ought to be preserved and there had to be a policy on the retention of government records in the Welsh Government. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 Code of Practice makes it clear that public bodies should make destruction decisions in accordance with an up-to-date policy using a method or process that is applied consistently and has been approved by the authority.

Public bodies must retain information if they are to need it where there may be a public inquiry and policies must be flexible enough to foresee this.

The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice hope and anticipate that the Inquiry will be scrutinising how, why and when messages came to be deleted or lost by the Welsh Government and its advisers, and the policies under which individuals claim they were operating, including the justification for the deletion, as we know is the case with the Scottish Government.

We ask the Inquiry to obtain and disclose all correspondence within the Welsh Government, including from Mr Drakeford, touching upon the non-destruction of material on phones, and we also ask the Inquiry to ascertain whether instructions were in fact given within the Welsh Government at any stage prior to or during the pandemic on the preservation of documents and whether there was any official or unofficial policy in the Welsh Government of deleting WhatsApps, or other messages, at any stage, including the use of the auto-delete function.

We note the evidence of Clare Jenkins, a Welsh Government special adviser during the pandemic, who makes what may be considered to be a surprising comment at paragraph 22 of her witness statement, namely that she sent texts and WhatsApp communications for government business on her private phone, but that "these messages were regularly deleted at this time", but in any event she thinks that they wouldn't assist the Inquiry.

We also note from the very recently disclosed statement of the senior special adviser Jane Runeckles, at paragraphs 79 to 80, that iMessage was set to delete every 30 days and that that 7-day disappearing messages was used for WhatsApp messages for the majority of the groups from when that function became available. In this statement, Ms Runeckles tells us that she is in possession of WhatsApp messages but that these will be made available to the Inquiry. We query why were these messages simply not appended to the statement when it was disclosed?

If the Welsh Government have actively as a cohort consciously switched to using the disappearing messages function when it became available, which we know is November 2020, this would suggest that, certainly at this stage, the Welsh Government knowingly adopted a policy or a system designed to delete government communications when it would have been obvious to them that such material ought to be preserved.

My Lady, you no doubt will be an expert on the working of the platforms of WhatsApp and the like, but just to be clear, that 7-day disappearing function didn't become available, as I said, until November 2020, and even then this function on WhatsApp would not delete all chat messages for every participant in the group, but only the individual using that function. And in the absence of deleting messages function, at the time of the pandemic there was only a one-hour window in which messages could be deleted, and again such deletion would not remove the message from all participants unless everyone in the chat pressed "Delete for everyone" for every message in the chat.

The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice would then just like to ask for a further update from the Inquiry setting out the Welsh Government explanation as to what happened to this material.

Can we also ask for an update in relation to the status of material such as informal messaging from Public Health Wales as well.

I now turn to a different aspect of apparent poor practice in relation to data preservation in Wales, and that's the retention of emails that we've just heard about from Mr Poole KC.

Now, we note the reassurance that has been given by him today, but the group remain particularly concerned that deletions might still impact on the ability of the Inquiry and CPs to put relevant matters to witnesses, so we do ask for a bit more information on this topic so that the bereaved families can be satisfied that this issue is no longer of relevance to the Inquiry and will no longer impact on the Inquiry.

So I now turn to some other matters.

As my Lady knows, one of the issues of concern to the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru is that Module 2B and later modules scrutinise the impact of decision-making on the older population of Wales, by reference to Welsh data, and seek to understand the extent to which Welsh policy and legislation in place at the time of the pandemic in Wales in fact made any meaningful difference to decision-making in relation to disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, including the older population of Wales.

To that end, the group support and endorse the submissions on this topic that have been made by other core participants for this preliminary hearing, in particular they draw your attention to and endorse the written submissions made on behalf of the disability people's organisations in Wales at paragraph 1.6, namely that the Inquiry is asked to focus on the gap between the rhetoric of national policies and what happened on the ground in Wales. The experience of the membership of the group is that there was a chasm between what government policy aspired to achieve and the reality, particularly for vulnerable and disabled groups.

I turn to the use of experts.

The group welcomes the instruction of Professor Daniel Wincott by the Inquiry and notes that a first draft of his report has very recently been received and they will respond in the usual way. They also note the Inquiry's reliance on certain Module 2 expert reports in respect of Wales for Module 2B. As you know, the group's already indicated their concerns that a number of these reports do not adequately cover Wales, either because there's just simply a lack of data known to those experts in respect of Wales, or a lack of Welsh-specific expertise.

The gaps from Module 2 have been highlighted in our written submissions, I think many times, previously, and where possible we ask the Inquiry to seek to fill these gaps, although we note the update today in relation to the data issue.

For example, as noted by John's Campaign and Care Rights UK, the report by Professors Shakespeare and Watson on structural inequalities relating to disability does not consider the intersection between disability and age, and we just draw your attention to that specific point.

In relation to the venue for Module 2B, as you will know, the group have already indicated their concern with the location of the hearing venue, which is the Mercure in Cardiff North. They consider it to be unsuitable because it's not centrally located and not easily accessible on public transport links. There is one bus, but it doesn't stop directly outside the venue. I mean, it's understood and accepted that the Inquiry is clearly now committed to this venue, but we simply ask that the Inquiry thinks about solutions to facilitate access, and it may be that that is a shuttle service located close to Cardiff station. The group, as you'll understand, are keen to ensure that as many of its members as possible can attend the final hearing in this module, particularly as it's the only one relating to Wales, and they stand ready to give any assistance that they can to facilitate access to the hearings.

Finally, then, can I take this opportunity to once again remind the Welsh Government, as we did in our opening statement for Module 1, that the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru are a group of bereaved families, they have lost loved ones to Covid-19, often in terrible circumstances. Many of the group are traumatised by their experiences. However, despite this, the group are working tirelessly to assist the Inquiry to bring scrutiny to the decisions of the Welsh Government on behalf of all those bereaved in Wales. My Lady, this is not an easy task for bereaved individuals who are simply members of the public. Delaying disclosure right up until the last minute fundamentally undermines and frustrates their ability to scrutinise all the disclosure and, in turn, effectively participate in this Inquiry. But the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru are of course grateful for the opportunity to provide these submissions and remain committed to assisting you and the Inquiry team in their work.

Thank you very much.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Heaven, and may I repeat my thanks to you, and those you represent, for the help that you have given to the Inquiry so far. I very much take into account the issues that you've raised, including the one about venue, but I think you know the Inquiry ended up with not many options, if not only one option, but we'll do everything we can to ensure that those you represent can participate fully in the hearings.

Right. Mr Straw.
