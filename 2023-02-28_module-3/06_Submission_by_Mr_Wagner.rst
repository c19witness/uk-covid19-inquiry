6. Submission by Mr Wagner
===========================

**Mr Wagner**: Good afternoon, my Lady.

My name is Adam Wagner and I act for two Core Participants in Module 3. First, the Clinically Vulnerable Families and, second, a group of 13 pregnancy, baby and parent organisations. I am instructed by Kim Harrison and Shane Smith of Slater & Gordon lawyers for both Core Participants.

You have our detailed written submissions on behalf of both Core Participants and I do not intend to refer to them in detail, and I'm of course conscious that I now stand between 150 people in this room and their lunches so I really will try not to be longer than I need to be!

The way I am going to set out my submissions is first I will make submissions on behalf of the Clinically Vulnerable Families and then move on to pregnancy, baby and parent organisations.

**Lady Hallett**: You may have to break in the middle if that is all right with you.

**Mr Wagner**: That is --

**Lady Hallett**: So maybe we will deal with the Clinically Vulnerable Families' submissions first and then come back to the other ones. Then you haven't got to rush.

**Mr Wagner**: That makes perfect sense. I do intend at the end to make some very brief submissions on behalf of both Core Participants but I will save that until after lunch.

So, beginning with the Clinically Vulnerable Families, which I will refer to as CVF going forward, CVF were designated as a Core Participant on 16 January, and they are keen to assist the Inquiry and the very grateful for the opportunity, my Lady.

I'm going to give a brief introduction to the group and their reasons for being involved in Module 3. CVF was founded in August 2020. They represent those who are clinically vulnerable, clinically extremely vulnerable and the severely immuno-suppressed, as well as their households, and they represent them across all four nations.

CVF has a significant online presence, including thousands of members of a private Facebook group and over 10,000 followers on Twitter. CVF estimates its reach is over 30,000 people.

The people CVF represent are at a higher risk of severe outcomes from the Covid-19 disease. They have a greater risk of mortality, around 7.5 times more likely to die than the general population, and they have a greater risk of Long Covid, around 5.2 times more likely.

For many vulnerable individuals, the pandemic is by no means over. Many continue to shield to this day. Indeed, they still face as significant a risk from contracting Covid-19 as they did in early 2020. The clinically vulnerable are, for this reason, the forgotten half million.

Life has moved on for the vast majority of the population and yet the clinically vulnerable continue to have to shield. They are denied free treatments, such as Evusheld, and timely antivirals. They are also denied basic public health protections, such as HEPA filters in public buildings and reasonable adjustments at work, which would make them able to live more fulfilling lives out and about rather than locked in their homes.

CVF agree with the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice that society is judged on how it treat its most vulnerable and marginalised. Clinically vulnerable people are in both of these groups.

CVF is keen to ensure that the Inquiry considers the full impact of the pandemic on the clinically vulnerable, the clinically extremely vulnerable (sometimes shown as the shielded), and the severely immuno-suppressed, their families and their households.

Such individuals not only face, but continue to face, greater risks to their lives than any other category of person. As such, any planning for future pandemics or consideration of the effectiveness of public health services need to take place with the impact of the clinically vulnerable as a key consideration.

So moving on to submissions, I will make four on behalf of CVF.

First, on scope. CVF has proposed in the written submissions four relatively modest changes to the Module 3 scope. I will begin with paragraph 11 as that is the paragraph which currently mentions the clinically vulnerable and clinically extremely vulnerable. It currently reads:

"Shielding and the impact on the clinically vulnerable, including those referred to as clinically extremely vulnerable."

CVF are concerned that the paragraph as currently drafted is potentially misleading as only the clinically extremely vulnerable were told to shield. The larger group of clinically vulnerable were not told to shield unless they fell within the subcategory of clinically extremely vulnerable. Therefore, we have proposed an amendment to paragraph 11, which reads:

"Shielding, as it impacted on those referred to as clinically extremely vulnerable, and the impact of not including all of those referred to as clinically vulnerable in shielding."

I just pause there to say in relation to terminology -- I'll come back to this point -- but the terminology "clinically vulnerable" and "clinically extremely vulnerable" has, as I'm sure your Ladyship is aware, moved on quite significantly since the pandemic and this Inquiry will have to think carefully about which terminology it uses in its different elements.

The other three proposals are at paragraph 8 to 11 on our written submissions and I don't refer to them in detail. Just in short, we propose an amendment to paragraph 6 and this is to add the words -- it currently reads "decision-making about the nature of healthcare to be provided for patients with Covid-19" and we propose adding the words "including the use of decision support tools to determine patients' pre-morbid states and their treatment options for Covid-19".

The reason we say this is important is that the Covid-19 decision support tool was used to determine the treatment pathway of patients with Covid-19 and particularly their level of vulnerability and the adequacy, and otherwise, of that tool, and indeed other tools, is critically important in determining how well the clinically vulnerable and clinically extremely vulnerable people were protected when being treated for Covid-19.

The third amendment is to paragraph 8 and this is currently drafted about preventing the spread of Covid-19 within healthcare settings. We propose an addition of not just the adequacy of PPE but the information given in relation to PPE. That's because, in CVF's submission, there was insufficient information provided to clinically vulnerable people about what PPE they should use: for example, what kind of :outline:`face mask` in order to mitigate risks in healthcare settings.

But also at the end of that paragraph, we request that the following words are added: "to include the impact on clinically vulnerable frontline staff and social care staff and clinically vulnerable patients, including those who are immune compromised." The reason we propose adding those words is, although clinically vulnerable people are mentioned in paragraph 11, currently that wouldn't cover necessarily -- because it refers to "shielding", that wouldn't necessarily cover the impact on clinically vulnerable people in the healthcare settings themselves.

We make one final point in relation to paragraph 9, which is in our written submissions. The second submission, producing an interim report : for many clinically vulnerable people, there has been no freedom day. The Covid-19 pandemic is not over. They still remain at serious risk from contracting the virus, which is still of course at large and we are subject to a series of waves in each year.

One of the key tasks for this Inquiry is to ensure that lessons are learned. However, the focus should not be solely on saving lives during future pandemics or epidemics but also on urgently addressing the ongoing risks to people who have a higher risk of severe disease from Covid-19 and their families, and also their reintegration into society. This could be achieved through, for example, improved health and safety and access to health service provision to mitigate against their ongoing risk arising from Covid-19.

In this regard, CVF respectfully requests, my Lady, that you consider using your power under the Inquiry's terms of reference to produce an interim report on measures which can be taken to improve the safety of persons who have high risk of severe disease from Covid-19 in the here and now.

We're very grateful to counsel to the Inquiry for her indication earlier that she assured an interim report on improving the safety of those at high risk of severe disease from Covid-19 is precisely what your Ladyship has in mind, and we hope that is correct. But the indication is of great reassurance to the Clinically Vulnerable Families.

Just a point on jurisdiction. CTI made submissions earlier about the terms of reference limiting consideration of matters which occurred after 22 June 2022, which is obviously correct. But we assume that Ms Carey did not by this mean that your Ladyship cannot consider matters up-to-date when considering recommendations, which is what we are requesting in relation to the current impact on Clinically Vulnerable Families. Indeed, if you were artificially prevented from looking at the current position in relation to recommendations, that would be counter-productive because you might be making recommendations which were already in place.

My third submission relates to the Listening Exercise and just a note on terminology. CVF very much welcomes the Listening Exercise and the references in there to the clinically vulnerable. It is important, in my submission, that the Inquiry's Listening Exercise team understands there are different vulnerable groups who have had, and who continue to have, notably different experiences of the pandemic.

The solicitor to the Inquiry's note mentions "data collection" and we submit that it's important for data collection and subsequent thematic analysis that these groups are given due regard. The risk of simply using the "clinically vulnerable" category is that within that group there is a very wide range of experiences of the pandemic. Just the most basic example: there were people who had some risk from their underlying condition but for whom vaccination has been effective, and for them they may have been able to return to some sort of normal life. But there are conversely a group of immune-suppressed who have remained particularly vulnerable, despite vaccination, and CVF recommends that careful thought is given to potential subcategories of those who are in the generality clinically vulnerable.

Also in relation to the terminology point, which I said I'd come back to, when analysing historic periods in the pandemic it will sometimes obviously make sense to use terms such as "clinically vulnerable", "clinically extremely vulnerable". But, going forward, we propose that the terminology of "higher risk of severe disease from Covid-19" is considered for use by the Inquiry because that matches the current Government terminology being utilised. Indeed, "clinically vulnerable" and "clinically extremely vulnerable" as terms have become historic in terms of how they are used, although you, my Lady, will have the complication of the fact that the public still understand those terms. But we just raise the matter now.

Relatedley on pen portraits or illustrative cases, we are very grateful for the indication that those will be used, and CVF would be very happy to assist the Inquiry in identifying individual case histories of those who are clinically vulnerable.

My final submission relates to adjustments for the upcoming Module 3 hearings. An inquiry into Covid-19, with Core Participants and witnesses who are extremely clinically vulnerable, should in our submission ensure that the final venue has robust Covid-19 safety measures in place. I have no doubt that's in your Ladyship's mind.

We agree, of course, with the Long Covid groups' submissions at paragraphs 53 to 55 of their written submissions on safety measures. We emphasise that for higher risk of Covid individuals, it is imperative that the venue takes due regard of any risk assessment for Covid-19 that includes its :outline:`airborne` nature and adjust the venue and requirements accordingly. In particular, CVF asks for air :outline:`filtration` using HEPA filters or :outline:`ventilation` measured by CO2 proxy, and ensuring high quality masks are available (such as :outline:`FFP2 or 3`), as well as lateral flow test requirements for all participants at the in-person inquiry.

We note, just as a relatively small point, that the guidance for those who were in the alternative room for today was not as clear as it was for the people in this room that they should take Covid-19 tests.

But, fundamentally, the key request I am making on behalf of CVF is that they and other CPs are consulted well in advance of the next hearing on the safety arrangements for that hearing because we've all learnt from being here for the first time a lot and we can offer a lot in terms of our experiences and expertise.

So those are my submissions on a behalf of CVF.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Wagner, and a number of very interesting points you make certainly as far as the preparations for the hearing centre are concerned. It would be a good time to make them because, obviously, the work is going on at the moment for what we hope will be the permanent hearing centre.

As far as terminology is concerned, I do understand it changes all the time and I welcome any expert advice on terminology we should use.

So thank you very much and I shall see you after lunch. We shall return please at 2.05.

*(1.04 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: (Luncheon Adjournment).

*(2.03 pm)*

**Mr Wagner**: My Lady, just on the topic of safety measures, I've been told by my clients that they brought a CO2 monitor today along with a number of other air :outline:`filtration` machines and they said that the level in this room is very good; so that's -- they're very pleased with that. I am pleased to say also they have already begun conversations with the Inquiry team, who have been very receptive to all of the different issues that might arise. So we're grateful for that.

**Lady Hallett**: You frightened me there for a minute, Mr Wagner, so thank you for that.

**Mr Wagner**: It's good news.

So I will now move on to submissions on behalf of the 13 pregnancy, baby and parent organisations. Those are organisations are: Aching Arms, Baby Lifeline, Bliss, The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, Group B Strep Support, ICP Support, The Lullaby Trust, the Miscarriage Association, the National Childbirth Trust (NCT), the Pelvic Partnership, Pregnancy Sickness Support, Tommy's, and Twins Trust.

I won't attempt to summarise all of the amazing work that those organisations do but I have done so in the annex to our written submissions and I encourage members of the public to look there.

Each of the 13 organisations has a unique focus. However, all of them agree that there are a number of key themes and concerns that the Inquiry should investigate, and this list is very much provisional but I will just give a precis.

There are seven points. The first is, during pregnancy. During pregnancy women and birthing people faced challenges during the pandemic in accessing adequate antenatal care including but not limited to accessing information, and having to attend clinics, scans and hospital appointments alone.

For multiple and other high-risk pregnancies where people attend more appointments and longer stays, the impact was compounded.

Secondly, during childbirth. Because of visitor restrictions in healthcare settings, women and birthing people faced giving birth alone or with too little support. This was often traumatic, particularly so in the case of complex and multiple births. Many hospital trusts suspended services such as home births and midwife-led units due to, in particular, staff shortages, which resulted in restricted and reduced choice for women and birthing people about how and where they were able to give birth.

Third, postnatal care and after childbirth. Families faced challenges in accessing postnatal medical care and infant feeding support. There was a lack of care in the form of the usual visits from midwives and health visitors, as well as limited provision through support groups for new parents. This negatively impacted both parents who were unable to obtain adequate support when they were vulnerable and babies who had limited interactions inside and particularly outside the home during lockdowns.

Fourth, neonatal care for newborn babies. Most neonatal units heavily restricted parental presence, for example only allowing one parent to attend or banning fathers or non-birthing parents altogether. This negatively impacted the short and long-term health of babies and developmental outcomes, as well on family attachment and bonding. There were devastating restrictions on parents being able to be with their premature and sick babies in neonatal care units, some of which would have been compounded by multiple births.

The absence of this close parental presence and care will have affected the early days and weeks of tens of thousands of babies, had a significant impact on parents' mental health and wellbeing, their ability to be involved in care and their ability to parent together.

Fifth, death and bereavement. Many women in birthing people received the devastating news that their pregnancy had ended, for example by miscarriage, whilst they were alone. They would sometimes have to share this news with their partners in hospital car parks rather than in the presence of medical professionals. Parents were denied compassionate bereavement care and some were even denied the right to be with their baby until their baby's death.

Sixth, vaccination. There was confused and conflicting messaging around vaccination, which led to a number of pregnant women and birthing people remaining unvaccinated, resulting in unnecessary increased hospitalisation and deaths in this clinically vulnerable group that could have been avoided.

So those are the very brief key provisional themes, and now I will move on to submissions.

The first submission I make on behalf of this group is that the Module 3 scope should be expanded to include issues which relate to antenatal and postnatal care. This is, of course, part of the terms of reference and should be included in the scope.

The Inquiry's draft terms of reference, as you know, my Lady, published on 11 March last year, did not include any reference to maternity services or babies. As a part of the public consultation which followed, the Pregnancy and Baby Charities Network, of which all 13 organisations I represent are members, although they do not comprise the entire group, wrote to you requesting the impact upon new and expectant parents and their babies during the pandemic was added to the terms of reference.

This was ultimately reflected in the final terms of reference, and indeed in the consultation document which the Inquiry produced -- this was seen as a very important added element -- and it's now one of the 11 issues to be investigated in relation to the response of the health and care sectors across the UK. The Inquiry must of course investigate all the issues in the terms of reference in order to fulfil its statutory obligation.

The pregnancy baby and parent organisations are therefore extremely concerned to see that the provisional scope for Module 3 makes no reference to antenatal and postnatal care.

Counsel to the Inquiry referred in her oral submissions to a number of proposals by other CPs in relation to the scope which had been rejected and we hope the fact that our request was not mentioned either as being accepted or rejected means that it remains under consideration.

We submit that the provisional scope should reflect and, where necessary, expand on the issues in the terms of reference and it seems that the only issue which appears under paragraph 1(b) in the terms of reference which is not covered in the provisional scope of Module 3 is antenatal and post natal care. This must be rectified so that the Inquiry fulfils its terms of reference.

Secondly, it's clear to person and organisations who have relevant information and evidence that they have to commence their preparations, and I appreciate counsel to the Inquiry's note in her oral submissions that Rule 9 requests would include antenatal and postnatal care. However, those are private documents which won't be seen by the public and, in my respectful submission, it is important that the key public facing document for Module 3 includes direct reference to antenatal and postnatal care because otherwise individuals and groups who proactively want to come to the Inquiry and give evidence may not realise that this is the module to do it in.

Finally, in the consultation document which you, my Lady, produced it was said that the overwhelming weight of opinion was that antenatal and post care must be added to the terms of reference, but at present, and we don't understand why, there is no obvious plan for the voices of those who experienced trauma and loss as identified earlier will be heard in Module 3.

So we have proposed some wording in our written submissions, which I will read out briefly, and this is: pregnancy, antenatal before childbirth, intra-partum, during childbirth, postnatal, after childbirth and neonatal newborn baby care, parent support, baby loss and bereavement, in particular the impact of that care on babies and parents caused by, for example, the limits on visiting those in hospital, such as parents and premature and sick babies, the reduction of in-person care and the information given in relation to vaccination during pregnancy.

We note finally on this point that a number of other CPs agree with us that antenatal and postnatal care need to be included in the scope, including NHS England, Covid Bereaved and Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved and the TUC. So we respectfully respect that consideration is given to including it directly and not just on the list of issues.

The second submission, which I can make very briefly because it has already been well discussed earlier today, considering the entirety of the United Kingdom in Module 3., and I'll put it very simply, we don't propose there is a Module 3A, B and C necessarily but simply that in good time the Inquiry explains to the Core Participants how Module 3 will be structured to ensure that the different parts of the UK are fully taken into account, and I'm sure that is all I have to say on that.

I said at the outset that I would come at the end to some joint submissions on behalf of both Core Participants I represent. I can take them very shortly. First is in relation to expert material. This is set out in detail in the written submissions and I know it's already been referred to by a number of Core Participants. Our simple points are, first of all, that the specialist areas are identified soon and we note the indication that will be in the solicitor to the Inquiry's newsletter and we're grateful for that.

Secondly, that identities of experts are identified early.

Finally, that the questions and issues experts have to address are disclosed to the CPs before they are finalised and not before the report itself is finalised, as in not very late in the process.

I submit that this interacts with the issue of whether Rule 9 requests will be shown to the Core Participants. Ultimately, there is no requirement in the rules and there's no consistent practice across other public inquiries, although the practice varies, but in my submission the overarching point is that the more information that Core Participants can see, not just as individuals with interest but as experts in particular areas, the better for transparency and also the better for the Inquiry in making sure that nothing is missed. So that's my submission on that.

Then, finally, submissions of the other CPs which we support. We agree with the TUC in paragraph 37 of their written submissions that the Inquiry should consider giving more time between counsel to the Inquiry's notes and the deadline for submissions and there's good reasons for this. There's lots of good reasons for this but in relation to CVF, they represent a group who have serious underlying pre-existing conditions, many of which cause fatigue, and in my submission a reasonable adjustment would be to allow for more time because it's really practically impossible for them to digest lots and lots of material in a short amount of time, even allowing for the fact that does happen in inquiries.

In relation to the Long Covid group's submission that the most number of voices possible should be included in the Listening Exercise, we agree wholeheartedly that consideration should be given to inviting younger voices into this exercise. We note your Ladyship's indication, too, that that would occur but we make a slightly more general submission which is that in the healthcare module there isn't any reference to children in the scope.

Now, this may be because it's generally assumed that children didn't suffer the same or anywhere near the level of morbidity and mortality from Covid-19. However, children were very significantly affected by the changes in healthcare, for example not being able to have visitors in hospital, those children who were clinically vulnerable and clinically extremely vulnerable who did suffer from severe reactions to Covid, including Long Covid. So we do ask that you consider, my Lady, adding more reference to children, both in the Listening Exercise, in the scope.

The final point is that we agree with NHS England's submission from paragraph 28 to 23 (sic) of their submissions that it would be extremely useful to see a road map of the future modules, and again, the point on consultation and transparency, the earlier and more detailed the better.

Unless I can assist you further, those are my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: No, you have been very helpful, Mr Wagner, thank you very much indeed. I promise to bear very much in mind all the submissions you have made. You have made some interesting points. Thank you.

It is now Mr Straw, I think.
