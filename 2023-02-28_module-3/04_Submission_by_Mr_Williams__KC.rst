4. Submission by Mr Williams, KC
=================================

**Mr Williams**: I think it is now good afternoon, my Lady.

My name is Lloyd Williams, King's Counsel. I am instructed, as you know, my Lady, by Harding Evans on behalf of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru.

I am pleased to say that as a result of the comprehensive submissions and remarks made by your counsel and the remarks we have had so far it enables me to reduce a little the submissions I was going to make, which were not in any event going to be lengthy.

I am going to go through the issues raised by your counsel in the order in which she's raised them, and the first matter is scope and structure of Module 3.

We're grateful, my Lady, for assurances that have been received from you in hearings to date that you fully intend to ensure that the interests of the people who live in Wales are properly recognised during the Inquiry.

CBFJ Cymru wishes to raise that the structure and scope of Module 3 should have regard to the need for sufficient attention to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare system in Wales. As you know, my Lady, because I've told you on three or more occasions, although Wales receives funding from the UK Government responsibility for health is devolved to the Welsh Government. Wales has its own healthcare system. NHS Wales is not a legal entity and instead is comprised of local health boards, NHS Trusts and Public Health Wales. Relevant offices and agencies, such the Office of the Chief Medical Officer and Care Inspectorate Wales are specific to Wales.

This means that key decisions made in Wales were largely separate to and often quite different, my Lady, from those taken by the UK Government.

This module necessarily covers wide ranging and complex matters. Moreover, investigation of impact on healthcare lies at the heart of the investigation of the response to and impact of the pandemic.

It is particularly important to CBFJ Cymru. A high proportion of those in the group lost loved ones due to hospital-acquired Covid-19. It is a fundamental concern to CBFJ Cymru that the Inquiry understands why hospital-acquired Covid-19 was such an acute problem in Wales and how and whether other regions in the UK adopted a better or simply a different approach.

We are grateful to the Chair for confirming that Wales will be properly considered and not simply as a poor relative of the UK Government.

However, in order for there to be a proportionate and effective investigation in this important devolved matter, CBFJ Cymru asks you, my Lady, to consider subdividing Module 3 into parts. I listened carefully to the remarks made by your counsel this morning but nonetheless I will, with some temerity, make short submissions on that.

The group asks that the Chair adopt a consistent approach for Module 3 as has been taken in respect of Module 2, namely for Modules 3, 3A, 3B and 3C to address the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. We submit this for the following reasons. Such subdivision reflects the constitutional position in the UK. Health is devolved in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There are very real differences between healthcare in Wales and the rest of the UK. The structure is different, the general nature of healthcare is different, access to primary care, prescriptions and out-of-hours care all operate differently in Wales.

There are differences in the decisions taken by Wales. For example, in Wales there was no Nightingale hospitals but rather temporary field hospitals and surge facilities. There are also different decisions taken in respect of masks and when they should be made mandatory. Decisions taken in respect of asymptomatic testing of healthcare workers were different.

We therefore urge you to consider once again the issue of separate sub-modules within this.

As an alternative to having four separate sub-modules, we urge you to consider an alternative, which is to have the evidence in relation to, for example, Wales or Scotland, an attempt is made that evidence is heard all in one go. So we have a week of Welsh or two weeks of Welsh evidence and so on with Northern Ireland. We appreciate that that may not be possible in respect of all witnesses but to get a larger group will make it more understandable to those listening.

My Lady, the issues that are particularly important to CBFJ Cymru include healthcare resources, lack of investment in IT infrastructure and digitisation of NHS Wales, ICU and more capacity, differences experienced by many of our clients' relatives and loved ones in relation to the quality of treatment received, and differences in palliative and end-of-life care received.

They want to know how infection control was managed in hospitals, including ventilation, testing, segregation and PPE. Want to know the extent of testing for Covid-19 hospital patients prior to discharge, whether the correct PPE was used and the scientific basis for choosing one type of PPE over another. Wish to know whether the belief that Covid-19 was fomite based led to the incorrect type of PPE being used.

My Lady, we wish to know whether the Welsh Government paid sufficient regard to the fact that Covid-19 was airborne and the date of knowledge for relevant facts about Covid-19 and who provided that information. We would like to know whether the local health boards adhered to a mandatory trading and whether there was sufficient education of staff.

My Lady, you can see there are many differences that we have identified. Our list of issues goes on for a page or two longer than I have read out. I am going to stop there because it gives an indication of the particular matters which concern Wales.

The final issue I want to raise on this particular topic is we seek confirmation of resourcing and preparedness for infection control in hospitals, resourcing for PPE availability being within this particular scope. These are matters as to the existing state of affairs when the pandemic struck, which we submit require to be considered in order to understand how the pandemic impacted on the Welsh and other healthcare systems.

We note the CTI's comments during the second preliminary hearing in respect of Module 1 as to the scope of that module, including the separate consideration of overarching factors and also then specific issues in relation to particular problems which arose.

We have set out there at page 14, line 20 of those remarks -- I am not going to read that out now -- that CBFJ Cymru seeks confirmation of the matters of preparedness in respect of hospitals being prepared for infection control, including the state of the hospital stock so as to have the capacity to implement it, resourcing for infection control measures in hospitals, and the extent of preparedness by way of appropriate stockpiles of PPE will be covered in Module 3.

If to an extent it is proposed they are not covered in Module 3, CBFJ Cymru would be grateful to know in which module it is proposed that those particular areas would be covered.

Update on Rule 9 requests. We noted it is intended that to ensure the Core Participants are kept properly informed the Inquiry will ensure that the Module 3 lead solicitor provides monthly updates to Core Participants on the progress of Rule 9 work.

As yet, however, we've not received sufficient detailed summaries. A recent example is that the ILT had received seven draft witness statements and associated disclosure and that there was outstanding disclosure which had been delayed.

While these updates are helpful, they're not sufficiently detailed to enable CPs to understand the full extent of the request. What we want to avoid, my Lady, is a position where we discover the true extent of the Rule 9 requests in the weeks immediately before the listed hearing for Module 3 and are then unable to raise any challenge or speak to the ILT about key witnesses who have not been approached or key issues that have not been explored with witnesses.

In that regard, CBFJ Cymru looks forward to receiving a Rule 9 request directed to it where the issues that are important to the bereaved families can be set out. We hope this input will assist with the Inquiry's development of the list of issues to be covered by this module.

Rule 10 procedure. In keeping with our submissions made at Module 1 preliminary hearing on adopting the same informal procedure in respect of Module 3, namely that an opportunity is afforded to meet with the CTI, either remotely or in person, following submission of Core Participants' observations on CTI's evidence proposals and prior to CTI providing a finalised evidence proposal. Therefore, we request a short amount of time set aside after CTI's questions so that further follow-up questions arising from the evidence can be considered with the Core Participants.

Disclosure to Core Participants. I suspect, my Lady, you are getting a little tired now of hearing

submissions on disclosure. I will simply make this

point. It is fairly obvious. We don't have any

submissions save we request disclosures given in good

time for us to have sufficient time to adequately

prepare for the substantive hearing.

Instruction of expert witnesses. At this stage we

don't have any submissions to make in respect this

issue, save in respect of timing once again. It is

noted that it is not proposed to disclose letters of

instruction but we will be informed of the identity of

witnesses, questions and the issues they will be asked

to address before the expert reports are finalised. We

will welcome that CPs will receive that information as February we request that consideration is given to                 14          early as possible so that we have the opportunity to

make observations in what we hope will be a constructive

and meaningful way.

My Lady, approach to evidence of circumstances of

individual death and pen portrait material, we note the

matters set out in paragraph 65 and 66 of CTI's note.

CBFJ Cymru request that the Chair give consideration as

to whether hearing the circumstances of particular

deaths would be permissible in respect of this module.

Individual bereaved family members within the group have

relevant evidence to give in respect of the way in which

their loved ones became infected, often in hospital settings, and how they were treated thereafter.

We note the mention of paragraph 66 of the calling of evidence regarding individual deaths or experience of Covid-19 may be considered so as to introduce a systemic issue. CBFJ Cymru welcomes the acknowledgement from the CTI in its note that to include this type of evidence would be in keeping with the Inquiry's express intention to keep those affected by the pandemic at the heart of the Inquiry and submits that such evidence would assist the investigation and cast a spotlight on the issues concerned.

My Lady, listening exercise. You have heard extensive submissions on that already. I am not going to repeat it save to say that CBFJ Cymru offers its commitment to working with the Inquiry team to assist in the development of the Listening Exercise.

My Lady, these are my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Williams. As constructive as ever. As you know, I began the UK-wide consultation on terms of reference in Cardiff and I remember vividly the accounts given by bereaved family members at the meeting in Cardiff and, therefore, I understand just how important healthcare is to the people you represent. So thank you very much indeed.

**Mr Williams**: Thank you, my Lady.
