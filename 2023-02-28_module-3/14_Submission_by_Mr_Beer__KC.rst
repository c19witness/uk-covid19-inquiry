14. Submission by Mr Beer, KC
=============================

**Mr Beer**: Good afternoon, my Lady. I appear on behalf of NHS England. NHS England welcomes the Inquiry. Responding to the pandemic has been the single biggest challenge the NHS has faced in its history.

That challenge has become increasingly complex over time as the NHS has had to manage the pandemic alongside a rebound in demand, elective recovery and vaccine deployment. This Inquiry will allow the facts to be set out and the truth to be told and, through that process, learning and understanding to be identified for the benefit of the future. Consistent with the NHS values and in particular to work together for patients, NHS England looks forward to participating in the Inquiry to help it in its important work.

For its own part, NHS England is prepared fully to account for its responsibilities and actions during the pandemic and passionately wishes to learn and implement lessons from the Inquiry. It is a learning organisation which aspires to the highest standards of excellence and professionalism, with the patient at the heart of everything that the NHS does.

It's important to note at the outset of this module of the Inquiry that NHS England is not the same as the NHS in England, which is the phrase that's often used to refer collectively to all of the bodies which make up the publicly funded Health Service, excluding public health in England. I should stress, therefore, that the Core Participant who stands before you is not the NHS. By way of illustration, NHS England employees account for only about 1 per cent of the total NHS head count in England of 1.2 5 million NHS hospital and community healthcare staff.

This point is a vitally important one and not simply because it will be necessary for the Inquiry in its substantive investigation that it undertakes to understand NHS England's purpose, remit and responsibilities within the complex and recently reorganised healthcare landscape. For reasons that I will explain in a moment, it is important for the point to be grasped now at this stage of the Inquiry's work.

So NHS England is a non-departmental arm's length body and is primarily responsible for the co-ordination of the provision of healthcare services in England and oversight of local clinicians and providers of those healthcare services.

NHS England's core function and purpose is therefore to arrange for the provision of services for the purposes of the Health Service in England, a duty owed concurrently with the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. NHS England does not have significant public health functions, albeit the Secretary of State routinely delegates some specific functions to NHS England on an annual basis.

It follows that although NHS England has specific statutory functions which are important to the issues being examined within Module 3 of the Inquiry, and to some extent at least informally represents the NHS, NHS England cannot speak directly on behalf of individual healthcare providers, nor on behalf of their employees. As a national body, NHS England cannot account fully for the diversity of actions and initiatives taken at provider level in response to the pandemic, nor indeed comprehensively account for the actions, decisions and experiences of their staff.

You will recall that in paragraph 25 of our written submissions we said:

"NHS England does not know which, if any, local NHS providers and commissioners or representative bodies of such providers and commissioners have applied for or been granted CP status [Core Participant status]. It is possible on the basis of the information presently known to NHS England that it is the only NHS organisation representing the Health Service in England in Module 3 of the Inquiry."

Your team has kindly disclosed shortly before this hearing a list of the 36 Core Participants presently designated in Module 3 of the Inquiry. NHS England, we now know, is the only NHS organisation representing the Health Service in England in Module 3 of the Inquiry. There are no other NHS bodies who are Core Participants in Module 3 of the Inquiry. The position is different in Wales and Scotland.

Now, given the push within this module to illuminate the issues through the telling of "operational stories", as they are called (i.e. how healthcare was impacted on the ground in hospitals and other care providers), it's even more important, we say, that there should be access to these stories. We know that you are already in contact with some of these organisations because NHS England has already assisted the Inquiry by sending out a questionnaire to NHS Trusts and integrated care boards. We stand ready to continue to assist the Inquiry in working out how it does obtain the full picture.

Turning to scope, you will have seen in paragraphs 27 to 42 of our written submissions we address three issues relating to the scope of Module 3. I am very conscious you have received a range of submissions on scope -- and it's 4.45 -- and the issues to be addressed in Module 3 have been amongst them. We've not sought in our written submissions to engage in our own red pen exercise and seek to redraft what you and your team have written in terms of scope but, instead, we have sought to address three bigger and broader issues that we think that the Inquiry respectfully needs to grapple with.

Firstly, the need by the Inquiry to explain to Core Participants and to the public its plans for later modules in the Inquiry and, in particular, to identify those later modules to set out the issues that will be addressed in later modules, i.e. disclose a provisional scope for each module, and explain how, in the light of that picture, cross-cutting issues will be addressed across the modules.

The reasons why we suggest that this is necessary are plainly a number of the issues have relevance across the modules -- we have called them cross-cutting issues -- and indeed the Inquiry needs to explain, we say, its thinking on how these are to be addressed across the life of the Inquiry, so that at these earlier modules of the Inquiry the Core Participants and the public know whether an issue needs to be addressed in evidence in submissions within this module, or whether it is to be addressed later, or whether it is to be addressed in more than one module and, if so, where the demarcation lines are.

You will have seen and recognised, I think, that this is a point that's made in the submissions of a number of Core Participants and I would respectfully suggest to you that you should take from that that the recurrence and replication of the issue means that there is a real issue here. All parties will be better able to respond to and work with the Inquiry following identification of the later modules in the Inquiry and the issues that are to be addressed within them.

We listened with care to what Ms Carey said this morning in response to the point that we made, which was to the effect that the Inquiry needs to retain flexibility about its precise timetable and have the facility to adjust its plans in the light of the evidence being gathered. As somebody who has sat in Ms Carey's chair, I completely understand what sits behind the reply that she has given.

However, we're not asking for a timetable, less still a precise one, and the fact that plans may change in the light of evidence received is not a sufficient reason to make and announce a plan now.

If I can take an example to illustrate the point, Ms Carey's note for this hearing states in its paragraph 33(b) that this module, Module 3, will include:

"How the treatments available to those suffering from Covid-19 developed and changed over the course of the pandemic."

Yet the Inquiry's website states that:

"Vaccines, therapeutics and antiviral treatments will be addressed in a future module."

So the issue arises for the CPs, the public, and indeed your Inquiry team: what is the position? Where are the demarcation lines?

The second issue is related to the first and it's a request for the Inquiry legal team to set out how it proposes to carry its terms of reference into effect in this module by way of the provision of a list of issues. Ms Carey has kindly indicated this morning that such a list will be provided and therefore I say nothing about it, save to say we look forward to receiving it in early course.

The third large issue that we identified is the approach to be taken in Module 3 to the obtaining and presentation of evidence from the devolved administrations. By contrast with Module 2, 2A, 2B and 2C, the Inquiry has decided not to split Module 3 into sub-modules which address the four nations one by one. As we have explained in our written submissions, NHS England commissions healthcare services in England only. Since 1999, responsibility for health services has been a devolved matter in the other nations and there are significant differences in how healthcare services are paid for and commissioned across the four nations.

In the last 20 years, for example, healthcare commissioning in Scotland and Wales has not been characterised by the same split between healthcare purchasers and healthcare providers as it is in England, nor in the devolved nations is there the same separation between Central Government and the NHS.

As NHS England sees it, the Inquiry is presented with a choice as to whether it examines the issues presently identified in the scope of Module 3 by either (a) addressing the position of each of the four nations one by one; or (b) addressing the issues that are within the scope of Module 3 sequentially or in groups, examining the position in relation to each of the issues with each of the four nations in mind as that is done and at the same time.

We do not adopt a position in relation to which of these choices should be made. There are advantages and disadvantages of each of them. It is a matter for the Inquiry. But we do say that a decision ought to be made and communicated to the Core Participants promptly, if possible, because it will have a substantial impact on the organisation and progress of this Inquiry's work.

Those are the short submissions that we make at this stage, hopefully constructively, each designed to assist the Inquiry in the conduct of its future work.

**Lady Hallett**: I'm really grateful, Mr Beer, and I do understand the concern about the lack of detail on future modules and particularly where it comes to cross-cutting issues, and it is something that I shall definitely consider further with counsel to the Inquiry. So thank you very much for your help.

**Mr Beer**: Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: I think it is now Mr Kinnier, who I thought was the last but I am afraid, Mr Hyam, I had not turned over the page so please forgive me if I have not been referring to you in extending my apologies to you.

Mr Kinnier next.
