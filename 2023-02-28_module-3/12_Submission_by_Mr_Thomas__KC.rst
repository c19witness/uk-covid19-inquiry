12. Submission by Mr Thomas, KC
===============================

**Mr Thomas**: Not a problem at all.

My Lady, someone once said racism is not a problem of the oppressed, it's a problem of the oppressor, who cannot understand the lived experience of those who have been discriminated against.

I appear on behalf of FEMHO, the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare workers (sic). It's a body of some 55,000 healthcare professionals. I'm part of a team. Ms Banton, Mr Dayle, Mr Odogwu and Ms Morris, and we are instructed by Saunders Law.

My Lady, your Inquiry has a very heavy burden but it's one that must be shouldered in order to achieve justice, accountability and closure to those affected by the events in question. The weight of this burden stems not only from the gravity of the situation -- lives lost, long-term illnesses sustained -- but also from the sheer complexity of the issues at hand.

Nonetheless, the importance of a thorough and unbiased investigation cannot be overstated, as it is essential for upholding the integrity of our justice system and ensuring that the events we lived through do not occur again in the future. Therefore, it is imperative that is the Inquiry proceeds with the utmost diligence and care, taking into account all relevant evidence and perspectives, and remaining committed to uncovering the truth no matter how difficult or uncomfortable that may be.

You see, the Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare deep-seated inequalities in our healthcare system, and it's imperative that we address these issues head on. FEMHO's members and their minority communities have been unfairly affected by this pandemic, with higher rates of deaths, hospitalisations and exposure to the virus. This isn't an opinion. It's arithmetic.

The figures speak for themselves. Black and brown individuals in the UK have proportionately higher likelihood of death and hospitalisation due to Covid compared to other ethnic groups. Black and brown people in the UK are disproportionately overrepresented in frontline essential jobs, putting them at greater risk of exposure. The disproportionate impact of Covid on black and brown healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, frontline workers, the evidence shows that these people in these professions were at greater risk from exposure to the virus, as well as suffering higher rates of illness, death, compared to their white colleagues.

We've heard about the access or the lack of access to adequate PPE to provide protection against this exposure.

My Lady given the data, it is clear that there is a pressing need to investigate not just the surface but to dig deep and scrutinise the root causes of these disparities and to take action to address them. What happened during the pandemic particularly to communities of colour was unacceptable. The obvious question is: why? We believe that a comprehensive investigation into Government's decision-making processes and policies is necessary to uncover any systemic failures that may have contributed to the disproportionate impact on minority healthcare workers. Such an investigation should explore the wider socio-economic consequences of the pandemic on these communities.

The failure to protect workers not only undermined their fundamental human rights but also posed a serious threat to the health and well-being of the wider community. We believe that a thorough fearless exploration of these issues is central for the public inquiry to fulfil its mandate and to restore trust in the Government's response to the pandemic.

In failing to fully explore these issues, this public inquiry risks not only perpetuating structural inequalities that have plagued healthcare deliveries to minority communities and their workers but also failing to address and identify underlying causes of the pandemic's disproportionate impact.

We urge the Inquiry to take this matter seriously and to demonstrate its commitment to justice and equality for all. It is time for change. We urge you to take up that challenge. So, please, examine the evidence, please hear the voices of those who have been affected, and please work towards solutions that will ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare and is protected against the future spread of infectious diseases.

We submit, my Lady, that it may well be that various human rights may have been breached.

Article 2, the right to life. This right protects an individual's right to life and requires the state to take appropriate measures to protect the lives of its citizens. Did the state fulfil this obligation?

Article 14, prohibition against discrimination. This right prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of any of the other rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention, and we invite this Inquiry to examine whether the state's response to the pandemic was discriminatory. For example, if communities of colour were disproportionately affected by the virus due to policies, action or inaction.

If your Inquiry ever needed good reasons, well, here's ten for starters:

1. Any failure to address the disproportionate impact on black and brown healthcare workers and communities will perpetuate existing inequalities in the healthcare system, undermining trust and confidence that they have in the system.

2. Addressing the concerns of black and brown healthcare workers will help ensure their well-being, reduce absenteeism, increase productivity, which are all essential for a functioning healthcare system.

3. The impact of the pandemic on black and brown healthcare workers is a reflection of long-standing structural inequalities and systemic racism in the healthcare system that needs to be addressed for the long-term.

4. The failure to address the concerns of black and brown healthcare workers is a violation of the Government's obligations to protect and promote the right of health for all.

5. Any failure to address the concerns of black and brown healthcare workers undermines the ability of the healthcare system to respond effectively to future pandemics.

6. The experience of black and brown healthcare workers has been documented, widely reported, indicating there's as strong basis for this Inquiry to investigate these concerns.

7. Addressing the concerns of black and brown healthcare workers will send a message that this Inquiry is committed to protecting the health and well-being of all, irrespective of race, ethnicity or social status.

8. The UK Government has a legal obligation under the Human Rights Act 1998 to protect the right to life of all individuals within its jurisdiction. Failure to address these concerns, particularly the concerns of black and brown healthcare workers, would seem to be a breach of this obligation.

9. The disproportionate impact of Covid on black and brown communities and healthcare workers has been acknowledged by the World Health Organization and other international bodies. The UK Government should take this seriously, as should this Inquiry, and investigate the reasons for this impact.

10. Addressing the concerns of black and brown healthcare workers will help to ensure that the healthcare system is more resilient, better prepared to respond to future crises.

My Lady, learned counsel to the Inquiry, Ms Carey KC, stated regarding structural racism the following, quote:

"... those are obviously important matters within society today but they are also matters with a far broader reach than this module or indeed the terms of reference of this Inquiry.

"Inequalities are very much at the forefront of our minds in Module 2 and, in our submission, including these matters is neither necessary nor proportionate, although I have no doubt that it may be a matter you will wish to keep under review as the Inquiry progresses."

My Lady, this, with the greatest of respect to Ms Carey and your team, would be a wrong move for the Inquiry to take, and I hope I will be able to persuade you not to follow that course.

You see, it's imperative that a public inquiry into a tragedy of this magnitude leaves no stone unturned in the pursuit of the truth. To shy away from investigating the possibility of structural racism is to ignore one of the most pressing issues facing our society today and risks overlooking the crucial factor in the events that led up to and exacerbated the scale of the tragedy. Ms Munroe KC is absolutely right when she says that structural racism is not some abstract concept or some standalone issue to be investigated. Rather, it is a necessary consideration for examining all the central issues of the Inquiry. The Inquiry has committed to examining inequalities, but you cannot diagnose, fully diagnose, understand and address those inequalities without looking at the deep root causes. It's like trying to examine why a tree is diseased without looking or examining the rotten roots.

As such, it's crucial that this Inquiry takes a comprehensive approach and considers all possible contributing factors, including those relating to systemic race and inequality structural racism.

So here are ten hopefully compelling reasons why failing to investigate would be a grave mistake for this Inquiry to make.

1. A failure to examine structural racism would undermine the incredibility of this Inquiry's findings as it would ignore a key factor that contributed to a disproportionate impact of Covid on certain communities.

2. Structural racism is a fundamental issue and it's relevant to the terms of reference of the Inquiry as it relates to the role of the Government's policies, institutions in perpetuating inequality and potential discrimination.

3. Failing to consider structural racism would be inconsistent with the duty of the Inquiry to examine all factors that contributed to the outcome of the pandemic.

4. The exclusion of structural racism from the Inquiry scope would perpetuate the very same inequalities and injustices that the Inquiry is seeking to address.

5. Ignoring structural racism would leave important questions unanswered, including why certain communities have been historically marginalised and vulnerable to the impact of public health crises.

6. The failure to address structural racism would prevent the Inquiry from fulfilling its mandate to make recommendations that can help to prevent future pandemics and mitigate their impact on vulnerable communities.

7. The exclusion of structural racism would be contrary to the principles of equity, fairness and justice that underpin the terms of reference of this Inquiry.

8. Structural racism is not a minor peripheral issue but a fundamental factor that shapes the social, economic and political conditions affecting people's lives.

9. Ignoring structural racism would be inconsistent with the duty of the Inquiry to uphold human rights and promote social justice.

10. Finally, failing to address structural racism would be a missed opportunity to promote positive change and address long-standing social and economic inequalities that have been exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic.

So, my Lady, I am nearly there. What must be done in terms of scope? Let me suggest a 16-point plan.

1. Institutional structural racism. Examine the historic and structural factors that contribute to health inequalities. The Inquiry must take into account the impact of institutional structural racism on health outcomes. Why the disproportionate impact? You've got to look at poverty, discrimination, social exclusion.

2. Access to adequate PPE. Investigate the specific challenges faced by black and brown communities regarding inadequate access. Examine whether the Government's decisions and policies effectively addressed the needs of minority ethnic workers.

3. You need to take an intersectional approach to analysing the impact of the pandemic on racially minoritised healthcare workers and, in that you need to look at their multiple identities, how it intersects with race, gender, social conditioning, disadvantage.

4. Investigate the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on communities of colour and examine how this was exacerbated. Was the public sector equality duty, the requirement -- was there proper regard to it? If not, why?

5. Health inequalities. Consider the impact of health inequalities on communities of colour and the Government's response to that. How was this effectively addressed?

6. Look at pre-existing conditions. You have to respectfully examine the impact of pre-existing health conditions on the vulnerability of communities of colour to the pandemic and investigate whether those particular vulnerabilities added to the risk that communities of colour may have risked.

7. Communication and engagement. How did the Government and senior management within the healthcare system communicate with communities of colour during the pandemic?

8. Language barriers. Examine the impact of language barriers on communities of colour. Access to information and services during the pandemic and investigate whether policies effectively addressed these barriers.

9. Employment and financial support. Consider the impact of this on communities of colour in relation to their ability to respond to the pandemic and investigate whether Government policies effectively addressed these issues.

10. Discrimination in the workplace. Did this impact on this question?

11. Mental health. Consider the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of communities of colour in the community and investigate whether Government policies effectively addressed these issues.

12. Education and awareness. Examine the impact of educational awareness campaigns on communities of colour again in relation to responses to the pandemic.

13. Data collection and analysis. Investigate whether collection and analysis of data on the impact of the pandemic was adequate and sufficient, taken timely.

14. International comparisons. Compare the impact of the pandemic on communities of colour in the UK to the impact in other countries. Are there lessons to be learnt from an international perspective?

15. Policy implementation. Examine the implementation of Government policies and guidance aimed at addressing the impact of the pandemic on communities of colour, specifically within the healthcare system.

16. Engage with and listen to the voices of those affected to ensure that this Inquiry's investigation is grounded in the experience and perspective of those most affected by the pandemic. It must engage with, listen to the voices of the ethnic minority healthcare workers, their representative bodies and other organisations that represent the interests of vulnerable groups.

My Lady, I am going to finish by saying this: you have our written submissions. I don't need to tell you that -- we take them as read. So in summary we say this, if this Inquiry is truly committed to placing possible inequalities -- I take that from your terms of reference -- at the forefront -- I take that from your terms of reference -- of its investigation, it must be fearless and thorough in exploring the impact of institutional and structural racism and inequality on the pandemic response and its impact on vulnerable groups in the healthcare system across the UK.

By taking the arguments into account as outlined, this Inquiry can demonstrate it's serious, its commitment to this goal, and ensure that this investigation is grounded in the experience and perspectives of those affected by the pandemic.

Finally, we ask you to remember throughout this process that despite the fact that so many lives have been lost to this virus -- and FEMHO's members, along with so many other people who are still suffering today -- nevertheless this Inquiry has a golden opportunity to make a positive change to ensure that the negative impact of Covid-19 never repeats itself and that communities are treated equally and with dignity, regardless of their colour.

My Lady, pick up the gauntlet. Take the opportunity, use your influence and power that you have been entrusted with to bring about real change and leave a lasting legacy for future generations. Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Quite a challenge, Mr Thomas. Thank you. Thank you for your written and oral submission. Very grateful.

Mr Simblet.
