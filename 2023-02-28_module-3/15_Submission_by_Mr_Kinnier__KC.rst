================================

**Mr Kinnier**: My Lady, prynhawn da -- good afternoon. The Welsh Government is grateful for the opportunity to participate in Module 3. As an all other modules, we offer our full co-operation and support for your Inquiry's work examining how the pandemic affected the healthcare system in Wales.

It is also right that at the outset, the Welsh Government makes clear its deep gratitude and respect for the unstinting and selfless dedication of everyone in the NHS in Wales and the wider healthcare system who, faced with the unprecedented challenge of Covid-19, dedicated themselves to the care and support of the people of Wales.

An important, if not the defining, feature of the Welsh healthcare system is that it consists of only twelve statutory bodies. That's to say, seven local health boards, each responsible for the provision of health services in their local area; three NHS Trusts, which includes Public Health Wales; and two Welsh special health authorities working across Wales.

During the pandemic, the Welsh Government worked closely with all the Welsh NHS bodies and the wider healthcare system in Wales. That closeness had considerable benefits in providing care. But, equally, we can all learn much from our experiences during the pandemic and, in that regard, the Welsh Government looks forward to supporting you in your work and, in particular, an identifying effective recommendations in due course.

The Welsh Government firmly supports your clear commitment to consider carefully the experiences of bereaved families and others who have suffered hardship or loss as a result of the pandemic. It welcomes your confirmation that specifically in relation to Module 3 the Inquiry will gather the views of people who needed healthcare services during the pandemic, including the relatives and friends of patients in hospital, the bereaved, and people working in healthcare settings during the pandemic.

The impact of Covid-19 on these groups was considerable, as were the significant sacrifices that they made during a time of great difficulty, grief and pain.

The Welsh Government is also reassured that the report from the Inquiry's Listening Exercise will inform the Inquiry's investigations in Module 3. The Inquiry's approach aligns with the Welsh Government's determination that people's questions are answered fully and transparently. To that end, we are greatly heartened by your assurances that the Inquiry will English that the voices of each of the devolved nations are clearly heard.

The people of Wales deserve no less, particularly those patients who endured illness during the pandemic and who may continue to do so; those who lost loved ones, and those who made very great sacrifices to support the healthcare system throughout the pandemic.

My Lady, diolch -- thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Kinnier. Mr Hyam.

**New Speaker**: Mr Hyam.

**Lady Hallett**: Again, apologies for missing you out. You only allotted yourself five minutes as well, so double apologies.
