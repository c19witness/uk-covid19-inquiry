*SIR OLIVER LETWIN (affirmed).*

Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry

**Mr Keith**: Could you please give the Inquiry your name.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Oliver Letwin.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you very much for attending today before the Inquiry. Sir Oliver, as you give evidence, could you please remind yourself to speak clearly into the microphone in front of you, and keep your voice up so that we may all hear what you have to say. If I ask you a question which is not clear, don't hesitate to ask me to repeat it. There will probably be a break mid-evidence during the course of the morning.

You have provided a statement to this Inquiry dated 24 April 2023.

Could we have that, please, on the screen, INQ000177810. Thank you.

The first page is at page 1 there; if we go to page 16, we should see your statement of truth at the end, and you in fact signed it on 24 April, and the contents of that statement are true.

My Lady, may that please be published?

**Lady Hallett**: Certainly.

**Mr Keith**: Sir Oliver, I'd like to commence, if I may, with asking you some questions about the functions that you performed whilst you held the post of Minister for Government Policy between May 2010 and July 2016, and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between July 2014 and July 2016.

Essentially, you held the resilience portfolio whilst you held both those ministerial posts. Could you tell us, please, something about that portfolio, why it was divided between those ministerial posts and what the difference was in those ministerial posts?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes. I should clarify that I didn't become responsible specifically for resilience until some point, which I can't exactly remember, but late-ish, I think, in 2011. So, as I said in my statement, it's from 2011 to 2016 that I was specifically involved.

That was in the context of a rather wide-ranging and unusual role, which began by my taking a large part in the formation of the coalition and the negotiation of the coalition with our Liberal Democrat colleagues, and then in the drafting of the programme for Government, which came out of the two manifestos, and then, in the succeeding five years of 2010 to 2015, the years of the coalition, absolutely endless discussions with counterparts in the Liberal Democrat Cabinet to keep the show on the road and keep resolving issues.

I was also responsible for monitoring the implementation across the field of our programme for government, and for devising the second programme for government that came along sort of halfway through the coalition, and for sitting on all Cabinet committees across the board in order to have a view of policy and where it was going and how it connected with the implementation and whether there were going to be coalition issues arising from it.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: So it was a broad portfolio --

**Lead Inquiry**: A broad portfolio.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: -- within which resilience was, therefore, a relatively small part, which has led me to reflect, as you may wish to discuss later, that actually there really ought to be a minister solely devoted to resilience at a senior level.

**Lead Inquiry**: Well, I was going to ask you, may we take it from the fact that, whilst you were focusing on resilience as part of a wider portfolio of obligations, there was no minister and there has never been at any time a minister whose sole responsibility is emergency preparedness, resilience, response, civil emergencies?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: There hasn't, as far as I'm aware, and I think that that is an error. I came to that view very gradually, but by the end of my time I was pretty convinced that we ought to move, and had I remained in situ I would have tried, therefore, to move to a model where somebody took that position.

If you'll allow me, I think I should add three other points. One, there was a tendency to learn that lesson in the wrong way. The appointment of a junior minister will achieve nothing, I think, in this domain. It would have to be somebody who's senior and who's close to the Prime Minister, in order to get things done. Because this, in the end, is not about elegant committee minutes and discussions, it's about pursuing things to the end and trying to find out whether things have actually happened and whether they're going to work. That requires someone senior and close to the centre of government to get Prime Ministerial authority behind things, because that's the way things happen in government.

The second point I want to make is that whilst I think there needs to be a group of people who are devoted exclusively to resilience in the sense of preparedness, and they probably need to be separate from a group of people who are ready to service and handle emergencies as they arise. The minister, in my view, needs to fulfil both of the roles that I was fulfilling very part-time, full-time, but both of them simultaneously.

You learn a lot when you're dealing even with minor crises about how to prepare for other crises, including complicated and major ones, and I think it's by being present in, during, and taking some responsibility for the handling of crises that you learn most about how to prepare for them. So I would keep those two things together.

That was one good feature of my role: because I was involved in dealing with flooding, with Ebola, with a whole series of fuel tanker problems and so on, at least I knew some of the problems that arose when you were facing a real crisis when I was trying to pursue my resilience review.

The final point I would make is this, and I find it difficult to explain this briefly and articulately, so forgive me if I'm not as articulate as I should be, but there's all the difference in the world between discovering that something is the case, shall we say, that the diesel available for back-up in local authorities is all very well for the local authority vans which run on diesel, but not much use for the care responders who use petrol, and actually getting to the point where there is petrol available. And you don't do that by attending to it on Monday and then waiting a long time; you have to attend to it on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday. That really is very difficult to do if you're doing an awful lot of other things. I tried to do it in the fields that I preoccupied myself with in resilience, but I'm very conscious that I didn't have as much time to do as much as I should have done.

**Lead Inquiry**: That's extremely helpful, thank you.

May we take it from what you've told us, Sir Oliver, then, that the issue of resilience, of preparedness and perhaps also some of the other areas involving civil contingencies, such as the risk of cyber attack and so on and so forth, was not a formal area which was assigned, if you like, to one or other of the ministerial positions that you held; it was a function or a post or an area that you grew, that you devoted attention to and which perhaps took up a larger amount of your time? It wasn't a formal policy area for which you took responsibility by virtue of one or other of those ministerial posts?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: That's correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

Could you just help us, please, with the differences between the various ministerial positions to which you've made reference. Is the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster a more senior ministerial post than, for example, the Minister for the Cabinet Office?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is like the Holy Roman Empire, neither holy, nor Roman, nor empire, neither chancellor nor much of a duchy, and it's just an honorific, an ancient honorific.

A minuscule proportion of my time, perhaps an hour a month, was spent on Duchy of Lancaster business, and that will be the same for any Chancellor. There is a perfectly well-oiled machine that looks after the Queen's lands in Lancaster and does not need to preoccupy a minister.

My real role was as so-called Minister for Government Policy, and actually, really, under that I was simply a jack of all trades, a Mr Fixit, I did what it was that the Prime Minister wanted done, and that was holding the coalition together, making sure that our programme for government was implemented, and trying to fix crises as they arose.

It was really out of the third, the fixing crises as they arose, role that I slipped into resilience and became progressively, as I learned about it, more and more concerned about our state of resilience -- or lack of it -- and became more and more involved in it, and eventually decided that really I ought to, or somebody ought to spend their entire time doing it.

**Lead Inquiry**: Whilst you were a minister, was there a position known as Minister for Implementation? We've heard evidence that at some point there was the creation of such a post, and Oliver Dowden, I think, was the Minister for Implementation from 2018 to 2019, but there was no such post in existence when you were a minister, was there?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: During the coalition Danny Alexander, my Liberal Democrat counterpart, and I were effectively joint Ministers for Implementation. Our job was to make sure that the coalition programme was implemented, and in a coalition, of course, that's a matter of contractual obligation, it's not just a matter of will or desire. So it was vitally important to the sustaining of the coalition that we were confident that that programme was being implemented.

**Lead Inquiry**: All ministers, by definition, start off, by and large, as amateurs. To what extent did you have to learn on the job in relation to the field of emergency preparedness, resilience and response?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Completely. I think I can accurately say that when I began it was entirely new to me. I'd been in opposition, Shadow Home Secretary, for example, so I had seen some of the issues arise, but that's a whole different thing from actually trying to deal with crises and trying to deal with preparation.

It was when I actually sat in the COBR room and discovered that we were not properly prepared to deal with a fuel tanker crisis or to avert it, discovered that the Civil Contingencies Act emergency powers were powers for having an emergency rather than preventing one, and discovered that it was only through the army that I could actually get someone to organise for the tankers to arrive at the petrol stations in order to prevent the strike being effective and thereby, ultimately, prevent the strike, that I discovered that there was a whole set of problems here I knew nothing about, and that's when I began to learn about them.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is one of the more difficult features of being a minister concerned with emergency preparedness, resilience and response, that you're necessarily having to deal not just with the arcane world of policy and guidance and the general application of principles but with, to use a word that we have seen many references to, operationalisation? That is to say, having to respond to crises and to civil emergencies, and to have to take practical operational decisions for which perhaps one may not be terribly well suited or trained?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes. I mean, first of all, in answer to that, I should say I don't think this is an area where policy matters terribly. Policy matters where there are disagreements about the direction in which some aspect of the country's affairs should go, and your government has a view, and then it seeks to find means of fulfilling that. There are no disagreements here that I'm aware of. Right across the political spectrum we all want to prevent emergencies arising, we want to minimise their impact when they do arise. This is not an issue for argument and debate and policy. There is only one policy, which is: minimise emergencies, make ourselves as resilient to them as we can.

It's all about the operations. It's all about finding out what actually is there on the ground. It's all very well having committees and structures and guidance documents and -- these can come out of your ears without actually knowing that you've got the right things there. You know, you can't -- you can have a guidance manual about PPE but if there's no PPE there, it won't be available.

**Lead Inquiry**: To what extent whilst you were a minister were documents such as the 2011 influenza pandemic strategy or the risk assessment protocols and guidance brought to your attention?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Well, they weren't, but for a reason which I've described in my statement.

**Lead Inquiry**: We'll come in a moment, Sir Oliver, to your request that there be a number of reviews and to what the response was. But in order to gain some understanding of the level to which you had to descend, in terms of looking at the guidance and the policy documentation and the protocols and the approaches, the written strategic material relating to how to respond to a crisis, was that the sort of material which would find itself to ministerial level?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Typically, it did arrive for blessing at the end of a very long bureaucratic process that had led to its formulation, but in the areas that I was focusing on, as I've explained in the statement, I was not focusing on pandemic flu because I was advised that that was already being very well dealt with, and I delegated that, therefore, to Chloe Smith. You may want to come back to that. It's a matter of regret on my part.

But in the areas I was delving into, proactively, the whole of our critical national infrastructure -- which I believed increasingly, and still believe, is wildly under-resilient -- I was not spending time reading guidance documents and policy documents, I was spending time with people who were running the telecoms system, the grid, the district network operators, the ports, the airports, the people who ran the supply chains for critical chemicals, and so on, and spending hours with them, hour after hour, in an inquisitorial mode, rather as you're doing with me now, to try to find out whether, rather than all the documents and guidance, they actually had the things in place that needed to be in place to make them resilient.

**Lead Inquiry**: So how does the system work in a ministerial office, Sir Oliver, in relation to the signing off, if you like, of important strategies, policies or guidance?

So take, for example, during your time in office, there would have been and there were produced a number of risk assessments, generally biennially, and those risk assessments would be drawn up by reference to particular and different risks, and they would be revised and considered by any number of government departments, by external advisers, by Chief Scientific Advisers, by Chief Medical Officers, in relation to health risks, and so on and so forth. That biennial risk assessment would then come to you, as the Minister, and you would be presented with it, and presumably you would be asked to give your assent to its promulgation?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes, but your description is accurate, that's to say I was -- I didn't know the details, but I was aware that each one of these risk assessments had been through this awesome process you've described, with any number of experts, and I was, of course, an entire amateur. I mean, I know nothing about the science of the spread of diseases or the science of almost any of the other things that might have come onto the Risk Register. Nor was I expected to be an expert in the science or the professional judgments.

So it was, of course, absurd to suppose that I could counteract or overrule all these experts.

**Lead Inquiry**: Or even be alive to the particularly difficult doctrinal or practical issues which underpinned the particular document with which you were being presented?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Well, I think that I should have said to myself, in retrospect, not, "Are all these experts wrong?" but, "Have they asked the right questions?" Because that is something an amateur can do. Perhaps only an amateur can do that. In a sense you have to be outside to the system, I think, to a degree, to be able to ask that question.

That's why I came to the conclusion gradually that we needed a sort of RED team that was going to ask the right questions, because I didn't even know enough to ask the right questions or to know whether they'd asked the right questions.

I think, in the case of the critical national infrastructure, by the end I got close enough to the subjects -- although, obviously, I can't run the electricity system and I don't know how the telecommunications systems operate as an engineer does, I did know what questions to ask by the end because I had asked so many questions and seen so many answers that I had begun to suspect the things I wasn't being told. You can't do that for areas that you're not deeply involved in.

**Lead Inquiry**: Emergencies are, by definition, of course, not business as usual. Is there a case, therefore, for a formal system of training of those ministers who are tasked with the heavy obligation of dealing with civil emergencies?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Not only a case, I think an overwhelming case. But that's just part of a much wider need for training, which emerges, I think, extraordinarily from all the papers that you've asked me to review and which I got the sense of gradually anyway, and why I'm so very glad to see in the Resilience Framework document the government has now produced that there is to be an academy. I hope that, rather than just dealing with how to produce guidance and how to write minutes and so on, will actually be about how to handle emergencies and, therefore, how to exercise for emergencies and, therefore, how to prepare for emergencies, to make sure that you can actually handle them effectively.

**Lead Inquiry**: Does that include, therefore, by way of exercise or training, enabling ministers to be able to better discharge the functions imposed upon them?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes. Yes. Can I add one thing, because I hope, my Lady, that this Inquiry will make this point, because I think it's incredibly important: if you're a Minister responsible for anything a fortiori resilience but even, you know, really important things like health, defence, for six months, you could have training for the first two months but by the time you're finished your training you're practically finished your job. If you're an official that does a job that's related to the crucial interests of the United Kingdom for 18 months, and you have training, which usually takes six months to arrange and, you know, six months to conduct, again by the time you know you're off.

I, by the end of my time working on these things for five years, with the exception of one or two people in the Civil Contingencies Secretariat who were continuing their role there and knew an awful lot, I kept on coming across officials who knew less than I did, as an amateur, me as the amateur, because they'd actually been in post for next to no time whatsoever.

So it of isn't just a question of training, it's a question of training and having a system which keeps both ministers and officials in post long enough so they can use the training.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that another way of saying that the revolving door aspect of some ministerial appointments and official appointments tends to undermine experience, efficacy and the ability of ministers and officials to be able to do the job with which they're tasked?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: I strongly believe that it does -- I think that's true as a general proposition, but we're not here to discuss the whole of British government -- in this crucial respect: I think having a minister responsible, whose there right the way through a government, and with officials who are committed to it from beginning to end and, with luck, longer than that, in their careers, is really critical to success.

**Lady Hallett**: Sir Oliver, can I just ask: you described the revolving door, and I think we're all familiar with it, across government. Is that because you think there is a trend to have a revolving door, with whatever government, whatever political view, or because there is a revolving door in this particular area because it isn't considered to be a good career stop?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: I think probably both, my Lady. I'm pretty certain that the entire structure of the civil service means that you can't really make progress in a career without going through endless different jobs one after another, which I regard as a disaster for the country, particularly disastrous in the case of things that have very long lead times and where learning from experience is critical.

As to ministers, of course the exigencies of our Parliamentary democratic system make it difficult to maintain continuity in every post, but in this particular domain, if we were really taking it with the seriousness we need to take it, I think we would have people who were there right through, and I thought one of the very good things about the way that David Cameron ran this aspect of our affairs was that I was allowed at least to learn, so that by the end I really did know much more than at the beginning.

**Mr Keith**: Sir Oliver, in your witness statement, you make reference to a specialist committee called the National Security Council Threats, Hazards, Resilience and Contingencies committee, which we believe was commenced around the time, I think, that you became Minister for Government Policy, but it was a committee which was very much within your brief, because you and David Cameron agreed that there ought to be a specialist unit in the Cabinet Office, which would deal with matters such as horizon scanning, which would feed in to that committee.

Can you recall whether or not the Cabinet subcommittee structure gave as much weight to the issue of hazards and civil emergencies as it did to the issue of threats, national security threats of the type, I don't know, terrorist outrages, CBRNE attacks, the behaviour of rogue states and so on and so forth? Was there equality, do you believe, between the two systems, or was the system that dealt with hazards crowded out to some extent by the focus on threats?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: I think there is always a danger that threats are more considered in Whitehall than hazards, because there's a huge apparatus dealing with threat. MoD, the Foreign Office, the agencies, security agencies, the National Security Adviser, you know, on and on. Whereas there hasn't been, up till now, though I hope there now will be, with the head of resilience and if the Mann/Alexander suggestions for an integrated management system were adopted, or, indeed, very similar to what the Rycroft review, I now see, recommended in '22, maybe we could create if not equivalent at least a counterbalancing power in Whitehall pushing for consideration of things that aren't threats.

So I think the answer to your question is that it was overbalanced towards threats.

But may I just point out something else which gets lost in the dichotomy threat/hazard: actually for most of our fellow citizens, for people who were bereaved in Covid or people who were affected by any of the other disasters which have afflicted our nation over many decades and centuries, actually it's the impacts that count and not the causes. Whether a biological agent is released by nature or by a state actor or a non-state actor, a terrorist, whether the whole of our critical national infrastructure goes down because there is space weather or because there is a cyber attack by a malicious party, it doesn't matter from the point of view of the way we prepare to respond and the response we exhibit. It's the impact that we need to deal with on behalf of our people, in particular the most vulnerable people, the people who are vulnerable to that impact. Unless you focus on impacts, you can't focus on the right vulnerabilities, because it's not the cause that causes some people to be more vulnerable than others, it's the impact that causes some people to be more vulnerable than others. Old people may be more vulnerable to some impacts, young people to others, and so on.

So it's not so -- although I do think it's important to separate between threats and hazards because of this overbalancing towards preoccupation with threats because of the structure of government and the weight of the money, actually I think the most important shift to achieve is a shift from focusing on causes to a shift to focus on impacts and dealing with impacts and preparing to deal with impacts and minimising impacts, and, particularly, minimising impacts for the most vulnerable people in relation to that impact.

**Lead Inquiry**: Does it follow from what you've said, Sir Oliver, that, going forward, the system for the assessment of risk, for the consideration of response, for the development of resilience, needs in a general sense to focus more on impact as opposed to likelihood or cause?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Absolutely, and you introduce an important element that I hadn't mentioned, which is this question of likelihood. I have great respect both for economists and for the Treasury. Genuinely, it's not a snide remark. But there's a terrible danger in treasuries the world over and amongst economists the world over that they're fixated with discount rates and probabilities. So if event X has a low, very low probability of occurring, and is likely to occur a long time away, when you multiply the probability low by the discount rate high, you come to the answer that it's not worth worrying about it compared to things which are right in front of your nose. This is a very bad mistake because events with huge impacts that are very unlikely and may not occur for many years, if they do occur, will nevertheless have huge impacts. As we've discovered those are, in every sense, human terms and economic terms, incredibly costly.

So I think it's vital not only that we focus on impacts but that we focus on major impacts. That isn't to say we should ignore the minor ones, but actually I think we're pretty good at handling the minor ones. It's the major ones that we're not properly prepared for.

**Lead Inquiry**: My Lady has procured a copy of a book called Apocalypse How?, found, I think, in all good bookshops, but it's your book. Do you say in your book that:

"There has been a failure, by virtue of over-reliance on statistics and probabilities, that the system should focus remorselessly on worst-case scenarios without worrying in the least about how likely these are to occur. This ought to be obvious, but it will seem quite counterintuitive in any established bureaucracy, because bureaucracies are used not only to cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is so destructive of fallback option planning, but also to the allied pursuit of probability analysis."

So are you saying, Sir Oliver, that the danger -- and it is a trap, of course, into which the country fell -- is of being unprepared for an event which, although it may be less likely, may have colossal impact?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes, exactly. I mean, my great regret about not having focused on pandemic flu, because I was advised it was being well looked after, is not actually about pandemic flu, I might or might not have been able to improve preparedness for pandemic flu, but that it might have occurred to me, if I had focused on that, that, despite the fact that all the scientists had concluded -- and no doubt they were right -- that there was a very tiny probability, by comparison with the probability of pandemic flu, of some other catastrophic pathogen, it might have occurred to me to say, "Well, okay, there's a tiny probability, but as a matter of fact can we, for a tiny amount of money, prepare properly to deal with it in advance?" And that would be the right question to ask.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, you made reference a few moments ago to the reviews that you ordered be carried out whilst you were Minister, and you made reference in fact to your junior ministerial colleague, Chloe Smith MP.

Could we have, please, on the screen INQ000013404, at page 1.

This is a memo dated 18 January 2012 copied to a number of people, including your private secretary as well as the private secretary to Francis Maude MP and a number of senior officials. It's headed "Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, Cabinet Office. Briefing for ministerial review of the UK's resilience to pandemic influenza". You will see that the memo concerns a prospective meeting with Anna Soubry MP to review the UK's resilience to pandemic influenza.

If you look at page 3, please, paragraph 12:

"You and Oliver Letwin will be writing to the PM with your findings (we will discuss with you when and what form this takes), but this may be some months from now. Consequently, if you have particular concerns with the adequacy of existing plans (or DH's knowledge of them), we suggest you use the meeting to commission DH to update you on progress in a few months."

So was this a memo, in fact, to your ministerial colleague, but it concerns, does it not, the series of reviews that you instructed be done into various aspects of civil contingencies?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Well, we should distinguish. There were those areas that I didn't commission, I undertook the review. So with the critical national infrastructure, I didn't have meetings with other departments of the sort that's represented here. I spent, as I say, many, many hours drilling down into the detail with the actual people operating the systems in question. Because my officials in the Civil Contingencies Secretariat at the very beginning said to me, "This is the area of our national life that we think is least well prepared", and so that -- I didn't have an infinite amount of time at my disposal, I decided to focus on that and drill down into it. So I didn't ask other people to do that, I did that. Very personally, sat there hour after hour.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Then, of course, there was all the rest of our planning, pandemic influenza, yes, but also all the sectors. There is another memorandum in the dossier here which is similar to this but relates to the care sector, for example. In all of those sectors, I asked Chloe Smith to hold a series of much less detailed meetings, assuming that the departments in question, under the lead government department model -- which you may want to discuss in a moment, I'm not a great believer in, but nevertheless -- would be concerned with preparations in those sectors, and her job was simply to interrogate them and make sure that they were on the job.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. Could we please have a look at page 6 of this document. There is a reference to -- maybe back one page, thank you very much.

In the middle of the page, there is this heading:

"UK surveillance of other diseases with pandemic potential."

So that is to say non-influenza diseases.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: "The applicability of pandemic influenza planning to other scenarios is good, and continues to develop."

Obviously the passage of time demonstrated that that was not an entirely accurate prognosis. This field of pandemic influenza planning and planning for other scenarios, was that one of the areas in which you were able yourself to carry out a review?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: No --

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, you're shaking your head. For the transcript, can you --

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: I'm sorry. No, it was not. I was advised, as I say, that that was under good control, as reflected in this official briefing, and therefore I made the mistake of not looking into it myself --

**Lead Inquiry**: Can you -- could you please tell my Lady a little bit more about the way in which you asked whether this was an area which required your personal attention and how the response came back to the effect that this was an area in which we were particularly well prepared and therefore did not require your personal assistance.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes. And incidentally -- I mean, I will of course answer that -- I should start by saying I don't exonerate myself because actually I should probably just have paid no attention whatsoever to this advice. Nevertheless, I did.

What happened was this. When I took on the job, it was, as I say, in the context of the fuel tanker crisis, and I was dealing with things minute by minute. When I had to time to draw breath and to consider what had happened during that un-crisis, because we'd managed to avert it, and what it showed about lack of resilience planning, I thought I really should begin a set of systematic reviews to find out whether there were other areas, like fuel delivery, where we were not well prepared for crisis. So I asked the CCS, how shall we do this, and what --

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that a reference to the Civil Contingencies Secretariat?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: The Civil Contingencies Secretariat, I'm very sorry. And I was, of course, aware that the National Risk Register or the National Security Risk Assessment or, you know, whichever of these documents one refers to, put pandemic flu high, both on impact and on probability. So it was an obvious thing to put high on my review, and I said to them, "Perhaps we should begin with this". And they said, "Minister, that would be a mistake, because there's going to be a full exercise" -- which became, I think, Exercise Cygnus.

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: "There is already a desktop exercise planned" -- which I think was called Cygnet -- "there is an indefinite amount of attention being paid to this by the Government Chief Scientist and his team" -- which I think was true -- "there is a great deal of attention focused on it from the Chief Medical Officer" -- which I think was true as well -- "and it's a risk which is" -- I hate to use this word, but it was used frequently in Whitehall -- "owned by the Department of Health, and you'll really just be reinventing the wheel, why don't you focus on critical national infrastructure, which is much less well investigated" and I followed that advice.

As I say, actually it's absolutely not an excuse for a minister, alas, because you can always ask the following question, you don't have to accept the advice, you can say, "Well, okay, I hear that advice, but actually I still would like to look at it", and that is actually what I should have done, and it's a matter of lasting regret I didn't, but I didn't.

**Lead Inquiry**: Therefore, Sir Oliver, does it follow from that that between the time when you asked that question and the time that you left ministerial office, so essentially 2011 to 2016, there was no effective or at least no effective detailed ministerial consideration of the area of pandemic influenza planning or associated non-influenza pathogenic planning? This was an area which you yourself played no role in supervising?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: The last part of your question is absolutely right, I myself did not. I just checked from time to time with the Chief Scientist and the Chief Medical Officer that they were content it was progressing, and had Chloe Smith doing what you see from these documents.

So far as that part of your question is concerned, therefore, the answer is yes. But it doesn't follow from that there were no other ministers who were dealing with it in detail. Of course the health department contained ministers who were detailing with it, as I understand, in detail -- you're talking here --

**Lead Inquiry**: But you were the --

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: -- Cabinet Office --

**Lead Inquiry**: You were the minister for resilience, preparedness and --

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- in a broad sense, civil contingencies?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes. Could we have, please, INQ000013415 on the screen, at page 2. Thank you.

This is a memo dated 28 January 2013. It's a memo from the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, and it concerns the review of UK resilience planning, which was being conducted by -- but not, as you've described, by you.

At the top of the page there is a reference to -- perhaps we could go back one page, actually, it might be a little easier. Then down to the bottom of the page:

"On the issue of countermeasures for pandemics, the challenges of ensuring a proportionate response early on in a pandemic, when knowledge of the virus was limited, were noted."

Then this right at the bottom of the page:

"MPCR questioned whether the stockpiles of countermeasures provided protection [then over the page] from other, non-influenza pandemic disease risks."

So the issue is plainly raised there as to whether or not the stockpiles for influenza pandemic would be sufficient for other non-influenza pandemic disease risks.

Was that a question or an issue which was ever brought specifically to your attention?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: No. I obviously received both the briefing and the account of the meetings that Chloe Smith had, so I will have seen these documents, and I -- to that extent it was brought to my attention and it looked as though, as you can see from these documents, there was a consensus in the Department of Health and the Health Protection Agency that this was -- I don't know how to put this, it's so ludicrous in retrospect, but -- under control.

**Lead Inquiry**: The evidence may show, it's a matter entirely for my Lady, that there were a number of strategic flaws in the United Kingdom's approach to pandemic planning, as it turns out. You've mentioned one of them already in your witness statement, a long-standing bias in favour of influenza and diseases that had already occurred, in particular the 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu pandemic.

There may also have been a failure to appreciate properly that viruses were unpredictable, with variable characteristics, and therefore the next pandemic may very well not be an influenza pandemic but be a non-influenza viral respiratory pandemic with just as catastrophic consequences, because of high transmissibility and deadly severity.

There also appears, in the risk assessment process, to be a failure to consider multiple scenarios. There was an approach by which there was a cause agnostic approach, that is to say a failure to consider the specific nature of a possible future pandemic, and, because the worst-case scenario was focused on, that there may have been a tendency to stop and think: well, does there really have to be 820,000 deaths in a worst-case scenario for a pandemic influenza? What about trying to stop it before it gets that bad? So preventing the terrible consequences from ensuing as opposed to dealing with the terrible consequences once they have ensued.

Those are all aspects of arguably a strategic failure to think through the issues.

You've referred in your witness statement to the need, therefore, for groupthink to be eradicated, to be challenged, for RED teams to be put into place to challenge orthodoxies, to ask the questions that have to be asked.

What did you mean by the reference to RED teams and the need to challenge groupthink?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: I not only will answer that but very much want to answer that. But may I just, before I do, say that I doubt that the right analysis is that there was a set of experts who got it all wrong. I think it's more likely that what happened was that the fact that -- it goes back to the impact versus cause issue and the likelihood versus impact issue. I suspect that what happened was that the scientists and the medics all came to the conclusion that the most likely thing was pandemic flu, and that other things had a much lower chance of success in attacking us, and that therefore attention should be focused on pandemic flu.

If they had been focused on impact rather than on cause, they might have observed that it was very likely that, whatever particular virus it was that attacked us, it would require to be tested, to be traced, to have PPE associated with it, to have vaccines developed for it and so on, which are dealing with the impact, and, as you say, minimising it in advance, trying to avoid having a catastrophe, or minimise the catastrophe, rather than simply handling it.

I think that that was the mistake, that was the strategic error to which you refer, and I think if we were to reorient our resilience planning towards impacts and to being prepared for them, we could make much better progress. Indeed, in some respects, even at the end of my time, for other reasons to do with Ebola, for example, I pressed for the Vaccine Network, which Mark Walport then took forward with Chris Whitty, and it did happen, and I think was a very helpful thing, although it wasn't developed specifically for the virus we were attacked by, because I knew nothing of it, but I did see from Ebola that there was a need to have a much better system for producing vaccines.

I think it's very clear, if you look at the results of Exercise Alice, which went on the very end of my time and was implemented, or perhaps not very well implemented, after my time, actually it had looked at the question of the scaling of testing, which Matt Hancock refers to in his evidence, or of a lack of ability to scale testing, and it also looks at the question of the roll-out of tracking data.

So these things were known, but they were not being attended to because people were not thinking about impacts in general, they were monomaniacally focused on pandemic flu. This is exactly why I think a RED team is needed.

**Lead Inquiry**: What do you mean by a RED team? How, in future, can orthodoxy be challenged effectively within the confines of a bureaucracy, in the confines of a government system?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: It can't be challenged within the confines of the normal bureaucratic system, because officials are just like the rest of us, they would like their careers to progress, and if you're a member of a team and you start being a frightful nuisance, it is not a career-enhancing move. So they need to be separate, they need to be accountable to a different person than the person who is responsible for the thing that they're meant to be enquiring about.

Whether, as I refer, they be completely outside government, or whether they be within government but somehow sufficiently insulated so that their careers can progress notwithstanding causing trouble for colleagues in government, is, I suppose, a matter for choice.

But the crucial thing is that there be -- this is not expensive, certainly -- just a smallish number, 20 or 30 people with the relevant expertise -- because one of my problems in all of this, obviously, was, as you rightly described, that I was an amateur. This should be done by professionals. So you want someone in the RED team who, all right, may not be as expert as the Government Chief Scientist, but nevertheless is a plausible, credible scientist, a credible medic, a credible industrialist and so on. And if they're sitting there and they're saying, "Well, hold on, you haven't asked this question", it becomes very difficult not to start thinking about it. And at the moment there is no such mechanism in place.

**Lead Inquiry**: So you mentioned earlier the possibility of a new statutory resilience institute, and we'll come on to that in a moment. How would such a body, whilst providing challenge to groupthink and performing the RED team function which you've described, how would it, though, be able to exercise the political control, or how would it exercise the political influence to which you made reference earlier, in terms of being able to be near the Prime Minister and to make sure that what is to be done is done, is carried out, is put into effect?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Well, I'm delighted you mention the Prime Minister, because I don't think it's a matter of political influence or political power or the power to do things. It's a matter of whether this RED team reports quite directly to the minister of resilience, if there is one full-time proper, and the Prime Minister.

**Lead Inquiry**: Right.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: If they do, things will happen. If they're siphoned off into reporting to some elaborate set of internal committees and bureaucracies, nothing at all will happen, it will be absorbed and re ... it will re-emerge as mush. It has to go directly to the people who can then say, "This can't be business as usual, the RED team has pointed out we're missing something, what is going to be done about it?"

**Lead Inquiry**: You refer to mush. In November 2015, you wrote an article called "Five principles for getting things done in Whitehall":

"Principle 1: volume is usually in inverse proportion to effectiveness ..."

And you say this:

"... the longer the document (be it legislation, strategy or a simple submission) the less effective it is for advising ministers, communicating with the public or getting whatever result you're looking for."

Whilst you were a minister, what view did you form about the profusion of paperwork, the sheer number of policy documents, guidance documents, strategy material, and so on?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: I formed the view that it was highly counterproductive. You will have seen my letter to the Prime Minister establishing the -- notifying him that I was establishing the horizon scanning for viruses after Ebola that he and I had agreed. You will have observed it's a page long. It was an absolute rule from me -- I wrote endless memoranda to the Prime Minister in that role, as you might imagine. It was an absolute rule of mine that if I couldn't get it on one page, the maximum it would ever be is two, because I knew he was very busy and I wanted him to be able to find out what, in essence, I was trying to say to him.

On the other side, I was unfortunately, as part of my role, responsible for receiving every public-facing document produced by Her Majesty's Government. They all came across my desk. Some of them were many times longer than the material warranted, and I started a process of putting, in three jars, green, yellow and red tags, that my private office very kindly arranged for me, so we could keep track of how many of these documents were ludicrously overweight and incomprehensible. It was about a third, a third, a third: a third were pretty good, quite short and clear; a third were not very good; and a third were totally catastrophic. And on the catastrophic ones I sent them back and I asked for them to be produced at much lesser length. In most cases I got back something less than a quarter of what I'd started with. It then often required further work to get it to be clear what the person was saying and we could sometimes then get it down to half of that length.

There is a huge overproduction of large documents. Mann and Alexander are pretty eloquent about this, and they're right.

**Lead Inquiry**: Yes, although their own report, of course, did weigh in at a monstrous 321 pages.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: It's too long, but otherwise it's right.

**Lead Inquiry**: My Lady has heard evidence that if you happen to be a local resilience forum and tasked with a primary duty of responding locally to -- the duty of preparing for emergencies and then also responding to them, you would have to be familiar with Cabinet Office-produced documents such as the Concept of Operations document, at 80 pages, the Revision to Emergency Preparedness document, at 591 pages, multiple versions of a document called Emergency response and recovery, there are national resilience planning assumptions, engagement with and guidance for emergency response, JESIP paperwork, local risk management guidance, humanitarian aspect guidance, Department of Health guidance, Pandemic Influenza Strategic Framework guidance, and so on and so forth.

Do you believe that there is a case for a radical rewrite of the available policy strategy planning documentation?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: I don't think there is just a case, I think it obviously needs to happen, but if it happens without having a well organised central team, under a head of resilience who has direct access to the Prime Minister and is parallel to the National Security Adviser, it will be wasted effort, because it will just dissipate through endless consultations and committees all round Whitehall and the simplification exercise will become a complication exercise.

So what's critical is to have a group of people who are determined to produce clarity, and then set them to the task of producing clarity out of what is currently much too unclear and much too verbose.

**Lead Inquiry**: Now, Sir Oliver, may we turn just to some specific issues and areas on which I want to ask you for your views.

**Lady Hallett**: Before you do, Mr Keith, I'm sorry to interrupt.

Going back to the point you have just made about the head of resilience and a specialist team, given the point you made about somebody having the ear of the Prime Minister, would your head of resilience be an independent person with an independent agency or would it be somebody ministerial like you who had the ear of the Prime Minister?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Well, there are various models around the world, and some of them do have an agency, and of course we have agencies for some purposes, and that is a possible model. I don't personally favour it, because I think there is a risk that in this absolutely crucial function, central to the purposes of government as a whole, it's very important that the person heading the work and the people working under them have direct access to the Prime Minister, and that's much more easily done from within the centre of government than anywhere else.

I don't think it's just a question of having a minister, however, I think it needs to be, as is foreshadowed in the framework, the Resilience Framework just published by Oliver Dowden, a head of resilience who is an official who is parallel in stature to the National Security Adviser and has, as the National Security Adviser has, direct access to the Prime Minister.

If you had that combination of a full-time senior Cabinet minister for resilience exclusively and a head of resilience parallel to the National Security Adviser, I think you would find that it worked, as I worked with Jeremy Heywood when he was Cabinet Secretary on the policy implementation front. He and I would meet for an hour or so each day and we would go through the various questions of what had or hadn't been implemented, and I would ring ministers and he would ring permanent secretaries, and often enough by the end of the day we had actually managed to get something done, and that's what you need as a sort of pincer movement. You need those people then to be able to walk into the Prime Minister's office without too much ado and without having to schedule it weeks off and say, "We've hit a problem here, we need your help in commanding that something be done". That I think would be the most effective model, but I understand that there are people who think that -- and there are reasons why they might think that -- an independent agency would be better, less captured by the system and so on. I don't discount that possibility, I just think it's less perfect.

**Mr Keith**: In your statement, you refer to, you say this:

"... working relationships ... are ... at least as important as any structures, systems, processes, plans and policies ..."

The system doesn't appear to have changed dramatically between 2011 and 2020. Can you recall, therefore, what the position was in relation to the nature of working relationships with, firstly, regional bodies and, secondly, the devolved administrations from the viewpoint of a United Kingdom minister in the field of civil contingencies?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Well, by the time I was dealing with resilience issues, the government offices of the regions had been abolished.

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed, in 2011.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes, I think fairly early in 2011 it must have happened. Therefore I can't comment on relations with them or how effective they were. I'm very sympathetic to the view that is taken in some of the papers I have now read as a result of the Inquiry, including Mann/Alexander, that it would be helpful to have a regional tier co-ordinating local resilience forums.

I hadn't thought of it before reading these papers, but I see now that that might well be a useful thing.

I can, of course, comment on relations with the devolved administrations. Not actually in relation to the resilience planning that I was involved in, because when it came to the critical national infrastructure and trying to make it more prepared for various kinds of impact, that was an England exercise, because the critical national infrastructure is a devolved matter, and I would not have succeeded in doing the kind of inquisitorial work that I was doing with the English providers of the structures, the infrastructure, in the devolved administrations.

However, when it came to handling specific crises, so for example flooding, Ebola, the fuel tanker crises, we did have repeated involvement of the devolved administrations, senior representatives of the devolved administrations, appearing in COBR, usually by video, and I had offline pretty continuous conversations with, for example, John Swinney, who was then I think the Deputy First Minister in Scotland, and I have to say that although, as you might imagine, there was some friction with the Scottish administration when it came to constitutional issues about independence and union, there was no friction when it came to dealing with these -- that I could observe -- when it came to dealing with these issues.

I -- and indeed -- indeed with -- I was at Brighton when the Brighton bomb occurred, I'm not a lifelong devotee of the IRA, but I had a perfectly sensible conversation with McGuinness about doing things in Northern Ireland in the context of these crises.

My experience was you could do business with the devolved administrations perfectly well on the basis of establishing some degree of personal trust and limiting the scope of the discussion specifically to something where we both had an equal interest; and they as much as I wanted to protect their populations.

**Lead Inquiry**: Resilience is, as you've already observed, a devolved issue, but pandemics don't recognise borders and, therefore, would you agree that any proper system of emergency preparedness and response must have in place structures for dealing with other territories, other nations in the United Kingdom, where there will have to be a joined-up response?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes, I think that's particularly true with biological agents.

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Although, for example, in relation to the electricity grid, there is, of course, a deep interconnection with Scotland, and indeed, while we're at it, with France, and therefore I had discussions with the devolved administration in Scotland and with French counterparts when I was concerned with the protection of the grid.

So, yes, you have to involve all those who are involved, and if you're looking at impacts, you'll quickly discover who is involved, and the impact of a virus is very likely to be nationwide or indeed, as we saw in this case, global.

**Lead Inquiry**: But your answer, Sir Oliver, appeared to indicate that the connections that you forged with the devolved administrations were based more on ministerial inclination and your own personal involvement than on a formalised system of committees or some body which would allow the devolved administrations and the UK Government in Westminster to be able to liaise and plan properly and fully. Was there not in place that formal structure? Did the system in fact depend too much on ministerial inclination?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: I don't know what I think about that. Half of me wants to say you're right -- well, sorry, you are factually right, there was not such a formal system -- and half of me wants to say that, you know, that sounds like a gap.

The other half of me says actually you can create any set of formal institutions you want, but if everyone arrives ready to come to blows, you won't get anywhere. If you don't have any formal system but you have good personal relationships, you can probably get it done pretty well informally. So --

**Lead Inquiry**: Well, isn't the answer that you don't need an overly ossified system, but you need a system by which everybody can expect to play their part and can envisage attendance, and they can attend and do what needs to be done, alongside good personal relations?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: That would be the ideal, I agree.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Lady Hallett**: Just before Mr Keith goes on, Sir Oliver, you mentioned working relationships with Northern Ireland and Scotland; did the same apply to Wales?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: I didn't, as it happens, have -- oh, sorry, there was one occasion when I did have relationship with the Welsh administration, which is in relation to flooding, which happened to involve them as well as England. And I think the same applied: they were present at relevant COBR meetings by video, we had a perfectly working relationship. As it happens, in the other cases I was dealing with, Wales was not a particularly material issue.

**Mr Keith**: Also in your statement you address the issue of the need for exercises and you state that you believe that the United Kingdom Government should regularise the practice of simulating responses to a variety of whole-system emergencies by carrying out at least two such large-scale simulations in each Parliament.

Putting aside the resource implications, and putting aside the undoubted fact that such exercises are difficult and complex things to arrange, why would exercises with such regularity have a demonstrably beneficial impact? I mean, if there is an exercise, for example, every five years, and recommendations and actions which flow from the exercise are properly implemented and acted upon, would that not be sufficient for the foreseeable future, or at least for the next five years, before having another exercise?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: In a particular domain, I think my answer to your question is yes. That is to say, if every five years we exercised for the impact of an unknown but ghastly virus or bacterial agent, and we did it properly, and we learned the lessons in the sense not of writing great volumes about it but actually getting down to the business of correcting the things that had emerged as not in place, that would be pretty good. That would be much better than we're likely to do at the moment.

But if you had, for each domain, one exercise every five years, you'd be having an exercise every -- well, it depends how many domains you create, but at least every year. More frequently than I'm recommending, in other words. My two years suggested that, for a particular domain, you probably wouldn't have a repeat for ten years, because you'd want to deal with the impacts of virus, you'd want to deal with major impacts on two or three different elements of our critical national infrastructure, you'd want to deal with major events of flooding. You know, there are various impacts that you want to look at and exercise for. So a regular programme would involve quite a long period between the time when you did one, and hopefully implemented the recommendations of it, and then gone on with the next one on that same subject.

**Lead Inquiry**: In your statement you suggest wholesale, whole-system emergency exercises, at least two in each Parliament --

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- which would tend to suggest a greater frequency than once every five years, and of course if it were focused only on one contingency, you would end up with an exercise in each contingency every two years --

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Yes, but I wasn't suggesting on one contingency --

**Lead Inquiry**: Ah. Across the board?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Across the -- so there are lots and lots of minor emergencies. I don't think you need to have whole-system exercises about them. There are identifiably -- you could argue five, you could argue ten, but it's sort of not less than five and not more than ten -- major kinds of whole-system emergency that might affect the UK, leaving aside their causes.

If you exercise for each of those every five years, you would end up with more than two a Parliament. If you exercised each of those every ten years you would end up with roughly two a Parliament. That was what I was thinking --

**Lead Inquiry**: All right. You referred earlier to Exercise Alice and you supposed that perhaps the recommendations from Exercise Alice had not been or maybe they had been properly implemented, it was in fact after your time, and particularly in relation to Exercise Cygnet and Exercise Cygnus.

The recommendations and the actions which flow from an exercise appear, to a very large extent, to be left to the government of the day to give effect to, to the ministers, to the civil servants, and of course they're not all automatically put into place.

Is there an argument that there needs to be a fresh, a new process by which we may be assured that all lessons and recommendations -- which, by necessary implication, are sensible ones, from an exercise which challenges the country's emergency response systems -- are put into place and are seen to be put into place?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Abundantly, yes. Some of this is ground we've covered, in the sense that one of the things you need is for, in my view, an external RED team in a resilience institute that would be keeping track of whether these things had been done, and simply couldn't be stopped from doing so.

The second thing we haven't covered, but is covered in the government's resilience and framework and is also in the Mann/Alexander report and various other documents, which is that there ought to be regular reporting to Parliament that can't be evaded.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Not because the Parliamentary debate in itself will shed much light, but because the duty to report to Parliament will cause the whole system to worry about whether it has actually implemented these things.

But the third element we have dwelt on, dealt with, which is that there needs to be a sufficiently well-armed body inside government, or a separate agency, one or the other, which pursues these questions remorselessly and at a high level and brings to the attention of the Prime Minister and, if there is one, the Minister of Resilience, if there are things which were the product of a particular report, of a particular exercise, which have not been implemented. If you had that triple architecture, I think you would stand a very good chance that most of the stuff would be implemented pretty well.

**Lady Hallett**: Are you moving to a different topic or the same one?

**Mr Keith**: I was going to conclude with one final topic, a very short one, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: A matter for you, whichever you prefer.

**Mr Keith**: Shall I continue and then conclude it.

It's obvious that resourcing is a most difficult subject, and one that is, of course, highly politicised, and it forms no function of this Inquiry, of course, to advise or direct that anything be done in terms of resources. Resources are a matter of fact and funding levels are a matter of different fact.

There would appear to be a problem, therefore, insofar as decisions about future funding and future resources have to be left to the politicians to decide. But would the creation of this new architecture to which you refer, a new resilience institute, be able to at least address in part that problem, because it could make recommendations as to how money should be spent, and therefore that would give the politicians the ability to be able to more transparently and more openly make the decisions about future resources?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Absolutely. I see that as one of the major roles of the resilience institute. It's extremely important to realise that most of the steps that really most need to be taken to improve resilience in most fields do not cost very much.

The problem has not been that there wasn't money available to stockpile PPE or that we couldn't have afforded to have a scale-up process for testing. These are minuscule amounts in the context of £150 billion a year of health spending. One can argue till the cows come home about whether it was or wasn't a good thing to constrain government expenditure and put the finances back in order. I would argue it was, others would argue it wasn't --

**Lead Inquiry**: Shall we not go there, Sir Oliver.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Exactly, leave that wholly aside. Under any dispensation that is remotely plausible to the United Kingdom, we could afford to do perfectly easily all of the things that would most protect us against the biggest impacts of these major whole-system emergencies for tiny amounts of money.

The problem is identifying what they are and forcing the money to be spent when the PAC and public opinion and the media and so on are all too likely to say: the money's been wasted, you have been holding this stockpile for the last 15 years, we haven't had an emergency, what are you doing? Then it doesn't matter whether it costs £50 or £50 billion, because they all sound the same, and then "It's a waste, it's a scandal".

We have to change the culture so that it's accepted that consciously spending money that we hope will never be used is a good thing to do if, in an emergency, it would save us a huge amount of effect on human beings and our economy.

That change of culture is what I hope the resilience institute could begin to achieve, the reports to Parliament could begin to achieve, the fact of having the resilience head sitting right next to the Prime Minister would begin to achieve.

Once you accept that this is a fundamental feature of government, and well worth spending a little bit of money on, then you've changed the culture and much will follow.

**Lead Inquiry**: Does that analysis apply equally to the field of public health improvement which, I think it's generally accepted, is a far more expensive matter than the narrow area of emergency preparedness, because in the context of a pandemic, a health crisis, a more resilient public health structure is obviously desirable but is itself perhaps very much more expensive?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: I don't think that most of the things that are most important in that domain are very expensive either by comparison with the vast sums under any dispensation we're going to be spending on health. It's typically much, much cheaper to prevent things, whether in the health domain or any other, than it is to deal with the after effects. We've just spent, I don't know what it is, the Inquiry will probably find out, £350 billion, £450 billion on the effects of Covid. We're talking about minuscule amounts by comparison with that, and it's well worth investing in advance.

**Mr Keith**: Sir Oliver, thank you.

Questions From the Chair

**Lady Hallett**: Two short questions from me, Sir Oliver.

You seemed to be disparaging about the lead government department model.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: It's inevitable that the expertise on transport will lie in the Department for Transport and health in the Department of Health and so on. I don't -- in that sense, I don't decry the idea. But when we have relatively minor problems. I found myself, for example, at one stage involved in what was not trivial for the people involved but was not a large-scale disaster, of individuals who were trapped the other side of the Channel or, you know, further afield because an airline was collapsing and they couldn't get home, which is a minor emergency. The Department of Transport was perfectly well equipped to deal with it, they knew what they were doing, I sat with them but it was not necessary to convoke some great, you know, cross-governmental arrangement.

So the idea that those kinds of risks should be handled by individual departments I think is perfectly sensible. There are, as I say, not causes but impacts that are so big that they are definitely rightly described as whole of system, you know them when you see them, and we could list them. For those I think the idea that one department is in charge is mad. Because they're not going to be in charge when you get to the response. The system we were operating already meant that they were not in charge in -- would not have been charge in the response, because in response we would have gathered in COBR, we would have been chaired by the Prime Minister, we would have -- and I think incidentally the XO and XS committees, that Michael Gove established originally to deal with Brexit -- to my mind the only advantage of Brexit for Covid -- were useful, would be useful, in handling any future cross-government whole of system emergency.

So it's very clear to me that you can't describe these major risks, whole-system risks, as owned by a department, and therefore they need to be attended for by a central entity that keeps its focus on that and learns continuously and has a corporate existence.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

The other question that I had was that you mentioned support for the idea from Mann/Alexander about regional tiers of resilience fora. I'm no lover of bureaucracy, as you may have gathered from some of the things I've said, Sir Oliver, but if you have a regional layer, why aren't you just imposing yet another structure? Somebody's got to manage the structure, call the meetings, handle the minutes. Why doesn't it become an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy on top of what is already quite a complex system?

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: Well, it could do, but -- perhaps it would help if I illustrated this not from my Cabinet Office experience but from my experiences as a local MP in West Dorset.

The LRF, the local resilience forum, in Dorset is composed of people from Dorset, county council, police, and so on, and, you know, if there's a problem at the village of Piddlehinton, this is fine. But if there's a widespread problem around, shall we say, the flooding of the southwest, as unfortunately happens reasonably frequently, first of all the ambulance service is not organised on a county basis, it's organised on a regional basis. Secondly, rivers, inconveniently, don't follow county boundaries. So if you want to manage them, you've got to manage upstream and downstream, and you have several counties involved. It would be tedious to go on enumerating.

**Lady Hallett**: I get the point.

**Sir Oliver Letwin**: There are various respects in which, for mid-level crises, regional co-ordination is necessary. It's then just a question of whether you set it up ad hoc, which is what happens at the moment, or whether you have it there permanently.

My argument for having it there -- and a small, I mean, I'm talking about five people or something, but a small group of people being there permanently, is that then as well as bringing together the relevant people to handle the emergency when it arises, they could be involved in the planning in advance, and so when they got to the emergency they'd know about it, the co-ordination.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much.

Well, I think that's all the questions, is it?

**Mr Keith**: There are no Rule 10(4) questions, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: You have been extremely helpful and it's been very interesting, Sir Oliver. Thank you very much indeed.
