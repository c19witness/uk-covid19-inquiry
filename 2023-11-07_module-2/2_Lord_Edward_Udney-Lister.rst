2. Lord Edward Udney-Lister
===========================

*LORD EDWARD UDNEY-LISTER (sworn).*

Questions From Counsel to the Inquiry

**Lady Hallett**: Sorry to have kept you waiting.

Mr O'Connor.

**Mr O'Connor**: Could you give us your full name, please.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Edward Julian Udney-Lister.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Lord Lister, you had kindly provided for us a witness statement at our request, which you can see up on screen. I know you're familiar with the contents of that statement. It's signed on the last page, we don't need to bring it up, underneath the statement of truth, indicating that the contents are true. Are you in fact satisfied that the contents of this statement are true?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

At the start of your statement, Lord Lister, and in fact it's on the page that we're looking at now, you give us some detail as to your career, and of particular interest for present purposes we can see from paragraph 3 that between July 2019 -- that is when Boris Johnson became Prime Minister in succession to Theresa May; is that right?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So from that time until February 2021 you were a senior adviser to Mr Johnson?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: That's correct.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And within that period, initially from July 2019 until November 2020, you were what's described as his chief strategic adviser, and for the rest of that period, from November 2020 through until February 2021, you were his chief of staff.

That second period -- did that second period start with Dominic Cummings leaving Downing Street?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes, it basically started immediately he left.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes, thank you.

Then I think it's in this paragraph or it may be another one that you say after February 2021, so when you left that role of chief of staff, you became Mr Johnson's special envoy to the Gulf, but only for a few months before you left government in April of 2021?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just briefly before then, July 2019, so before you started your role at Downing Street, you describe having held a number of, first of all, commercial roles in the fire and security industry, and also, insofar as public service is concerned, you were leader of Wandsworth Council for a lengthy period between 1992 and 2011; is that right?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Then, after that, chief of staff to the Mayor of London, that is Boris Johnson, and also a Deputy Mayor of London between 2011 and 2019, and that's a longer period, I think than --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: 16.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Sorry, 2016?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, that explains that discrepancy.

Then a non-executive director at the Foreign Office between 2017 and 2019.

So do we see, then, Lord Lister, that you had in fact worked with, perhaps closely with, Boris Johnson for some considerable period of time before 2019, first of all in City Hall and then at the Foreign Office?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes, it was -- it was -- I worked with him very closely whilst at City Hall, but then I was more remote, but then I went back to -- well, helping him in the sort of spring of 2019 when he was running to become leader of the Conservative Party.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The Inquiry has now heard from quite a number of the people who worked closely with the Prime Minister during the pandemic, some special advisers, some civil servants. It would seem from the outline we've just seen that you may have been, of those people, the person who had worked with Boris Johnson for the longest period of time; would that be fair?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think so, yes, of all the people that are on the list, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can you give us in a nutshell what your working and personal relationship with him was like, for example when you started working with him in 2019 in Downing Street?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: It was -- I was in a unique position. I was -- I sat outside his office. I was somebody he would speak to quite regularly. I was able to go in and speak to him after meetings. I was in a position where he'd use me to get information or wanted to sound off about things or to check on something.

Look, I'd known the man for ten years, so yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Is it fair to say during that time you were in Downing Street before Dominic Cummings left that you and he had a sort of shared or split responsibility in terms of policy coverage?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We can see this described actually in paragraph 4 of your witness statement, which is on page 2. You say that as chief strategic adviser your areas of responsibility were foreign policy, security, defence and trade, business, whereas Mr Cummings had responsibility for areas of domestic policy; is that a --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In broad terms?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: That was, in broad terms, the split between us.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You also say that your role included relations with Stormont, that's Northern Ireland, and also I think the Irish Government itself?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Well, during the -- particularly during the period from July 2019 to December of 2019, while Brexit was under way, I was involved very directly in all the negotiations with the Irish Government and with Stormont, which was at the time quite a difficult series of negotiations.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm just going to read you a few sentences from Dominic Cummings' witness statement and see if you agree with what he said about the relationship that the two of you had to the Prime Minister. He said this:

"I was seen by the system as the PM's most senior political adviser in most ways, but it was also clear to some officials near the centre of power that on some matters the PM listened more to Lord Lister than to me, and that the PM gave Lord Lister things to do without always informing me."

Fair summary?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes, I think that's probably right, yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: How did you get on with Mr Cummings, Lord Lister?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: We worked together, we had desks facing each other so we knew each other. I can't say there was any close relationship. We were just work colleagues.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's move on, if we may, to the early stages of the pandemic, and for this if we can go to paragraph 6 of your witness statement, which is on page 3. If we can pick it up about five or six lines down, you say this:

"On 27 February 2020 I set out my concerns around the threat from Covid-19 from an economic standpoint, indicating that this was as important as the health issues and needed to be discussed in Cobra."

We can see, Lord Lister, what you meant by that, and what you said, if we go to a document which is INQ000236371, please, and it's on page 47 of that document. I think this is the message that you were referring to in that part of the witness statement we looked at. Do you see it's at the top here, dated 27 February, you say:

"Air freight rates in Asia up 500% and four days of drops on stock exchange. In my opinion this is the real Coronavirus threat. At best this [maybe you meant 'there'] will be zero growth this year. Can I suggest that at the COBRA on Monday the economic bit is as important as the health input?"

Just to remind ourselves, we've heard a lot of evidence about the developing understanding of the virus. We're at the end of February here. Was this actually your view at the time, that the economic risk presented was as serious as the health risk?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think you -- in the context of that point in time, when we did not appreciate the true effect of Covid, and that evolved over the coming days, but at that point in time, we didn't -- we were not really aware of it, I was worried about the economic situation. I was worried that we were going to have a severe recession as a result of it. I was also concerned -- I mean, we weren't talking about lockdowns or anything at that time, this was all pre that, and I was just concerned that the effect on the economy would be severe.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Were you concerned, perhaps it follows from what you have said, that these economic risks were being either overlooked or at least downplayed?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I felt at that time that all the emphasis was on the health risk, which we were still trying to understand, and there wasn't enough balance about some of the other problems that were arising, and that if -- yes, health was a serious problem. I mean, I don't think at that point anybody had died from coronavirus, it was still very early in the process. It was just a worry that it was ... everything was coming from health. All the lobbying of the Prime Minister was coming from one direction and there wasn't enough of the counterarguments being put on the table.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do you think it's possible that, in trying to redress the balance, which I think is what you're describing here, you may have been taken to, as it were, diminish the health arguments on the other side of the balance?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No, I don't think I ever diminished the health risks, because we could see that, and I think it was around then that -- I think I do put it in a document somewhere -- that we were starting to get a feel from China that it was becoming clear that the Chinese government was actually losing their efforts to contain the disease, and it was beginning to be clear that that was not succeeding.

I was, I think, just worried that ... it was a finely balanced issue, and I still believe it's a finely balanced issue all the way through, and yes -- we may or may not go there in a minute, but yes we go into lockdown, but the decision to go into lockdown is not an easy one and there are conflicting issues which do need to be resolved and do need to be talked about.

**Counsel Inquiry**: As you say, I'm going to come and ask you some separate questions about exactly that, that balance between the harms of lockdown and the benefits of it, both in terms of the first lockdown and later in the year.

Finally, still sticking in February for a moment, another theme of the evidence that we've seen is that around this time Mr Johnson was telling those around him that he thought what was happening was an overreaction, or at least that he was worried that there would be an overreaction to the pandemic, as it was developing.

Is that a concern that, first of all, you heard him express, and, secondly, that you shared at that stage?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Well, I certainly shared that view. I think he did express that as well. I mean, I think everybody was very worried that we were overreacting to something which, at that stage, we didn't believe was going to be as bad as it subsequently became. And certainly it was largely confined to China.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's move on just a little bit, Lord Lister. If we can go to page 10 of your statement, please, it's at paragraph 23, I just want to touch on the meetings that you describe attending regularly, and I think -- sorry, we're on -- that's it.

So I still want to be asking you about that early period in, let's say, February and March, but I think this paragraph applies to that time. You say you attended a number of core meetings, again meetings that we have heard something of from other witnesses, for example the 8.30 and then 9.15 meetings, the 9.15 meeting being the one with the Prime Minister, COBR meetings whenever the Prime Minister attended, Cabinet meetings and so on.

You say also, if we can look at the next paragraph that you regarded those meetings as an effective basis for decision-making that was going on at the time.

Just going back to the morning meetings for a moment, it's right, isn't it, that another of the regular attendees of those meetings in this period was Helen MacNamara, the Deputy Cabinet Secretary?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: (Witness nods)

**Counsel Inquiry**: You may have heard that her evidence about the atmosphere and discussion in the morning meetings during this period, so let's say February/March 2020, certainly the meetings that she attended, was that the atmosphere was, in her words, confident and macho. She said that wasn't a new thing but that this atmosphere was "more so than usual", and she said the atmosphere was one of "we were going to be world beating at conquering Covid-19 as well as everything else".

Is that a description of those meetings that you recognise?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Well, I'm not so sure about the last statement you made, I don't recognise that, but yes, I think there was a great deal of confidence at that time that this was a disease, it wasn't going to be as serious as people made out. I mean, it wasn't that long before we'd had the whole of the SARS episode, which had largely stayed confined to the Far East, it hadn't really come into Europe. We were fairly confident at that stage it wasn't going to come, and there was a concern that we didn't overreact to a problem. And that there was a lot of other things that needed to be done. It's worth remembering that by then we were only now some two months from a general election, two months from the Brexit date, there was a lot of other things on the agenda.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Lord Lister, confidence is one thing, but the effect of Helen MacNamara's evidence was not that the mood at these meetings was confident, but rather that it was overconfident. That wasn't something that she was saying in hindsight, she describes being concerned about the overconfidence at the time. So is that something that you recognise?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think I -- what I recognise is that there was a belief that we had a health system that would be able to withstand it, that they had plans in place, it was well organised, it was well structured. And I don't want to jump forward too much, but it was only when we reached the Italian situation that it dawned on everybody that this wasn't like SARS in the Far East, this wasn't a relatively minor disease, this was serious. And so that was -- that was, what, in the first week of March?

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Let us move on to that period, only a week or so on from what we're discussing.

If we can go, in fact, it's just a page or two back in your statement, to page 8 and paragraph 21, so we say -- you're here describing a meeting in early March 2020, and approximately that is the time, isn't it, Lord Lister, when, amongst other things, it became apparent that the Italian, particularly in northern Italy, in Lombardy, that the health systems there were struggling to cope, we saw images on the news and so on of hospitals being overwhelmed. That was the time of this meeting, was it not?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes. I mean, and what was particularly striking about it was that the Italian health system was generally regarded as pretty good health system, as good as the UK one, so we were looking at a country that was very similar to ourselves.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Helen MacNamara said amongst other things that she remembered around that time in those morning meetings there being a sense that we would do better than the Italians, almost as though there was somehow a belief that they'd got it wrong or that we would manage to not make the same mistakes as the Italians; again, is that something you remember?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Erm, I'm not sure about that, but certainly I think we -- yes, there was a feeling that we are going to do better than this, it's not going to be as bad as that. But I think -- we were still really in the position where we believed that the system had plans that it would be able to cope with this, the Health Minister was confident, everybody was confident.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Well, let's look at this paragraph. For the first five or six lines of it, you essentially describe being briefed in a meeting in early March by Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance about what we know and understand to be the mitigation strategy, herd immunity strategy, and clearly you were given that information.

Then four or five lines up from the bottom, you say:

"On or around 12 March ... [you] recall the Cabinet Secretary advising the [Prime Minister] to explain to the public that the government's plan to combat Covid-19 was akin to 'chickenpox parties'."

Again, that's something we've heard about in other evidence but it's something you remember, is it, that -- Mark Sedwill using that term --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Well, I remember it being said, I can't tell you at which event or anything else now, but yes, it was -- it was made, but it was made in context, and for people of my age that was -- that was how -- when we were young that was how chickenpox was dealt with. And it was -- it was still a belief that Covid was something that ... herd immunity was the only answer, you needed to catch it, catch it quickly, and get it over and done with.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's read on, just the last few words of this page and then we'll go to the next one:

"It was also in this context that the Prime Minister suggested to senior civil servants and advisers that he wanted to be injected with Covid-19 on television to demonstrate to the public that it did not pose a threat."

Then you say that you "appreciate on reflection that those were unhelpful comments, but they were made at a time of high stress and limited understanding of what lay ahead".

Of course you weren't able to know, neither was Mr Johnson, everything that would develop over the following weeks and months, Lord Lister, but I just want to take you back to what you tell us that Mr Johnson said, that he wanted to be injected with Covid-19 to demonstrate to the public that it didn't pose a threat.

It did pose a threat, didn't it?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: It ... I've got to go back again. It was not -- we were at -- I'm a little bit uncertain of timings of some of these things, but it was -- it was before the Italian situation had really become apparent to everybody. It was the time when Covid was not seen as being the serious disease. It subsequently became or was seen to be. It was a moment in time. I think it was an unfortunate comment, but I think when you take it in the context -- out of context, like now, and in the timing, it was just an unfortunate comment.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, I understand that's what, how you regard it, Lord Lister, but I do want to press you a little. Do you think, then, that it wasn't necessarily made at the same time as the "chickenpox parties" comment?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I really am not sure, I cannot -- I cannot answer that question.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No. Well, even if it had been made some time earlier, it had been known for many weeks by that stage, or it was known for many weeks before then that Covid was a disease which would kill many of the people who caught it. So surely the Prime Minister wouldn't want to be telling the British public that it didn't pose a threat?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I come back to, if I may, in answer to your question, this is not that dissimilar to the situation we'd had with things like SARS, where it had been a killer disease but it had been a disease which had not transmitted itself to Europe, we had -- not reached us, and we were still living in the forlorn hope, as it turned out, that it wasn't going to come. That obviously was wrong.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, there is a difference, but I don't think anyone injected themselves live on television with SARS, Lord Lister, nor would they have been well advised to do so.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I fully accept it's a comment that shouldn't have been made, but it was made at the heat of the moment, that's all.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do you think whenever he made this comment, and obviously this is something we can ask him, but you've raised this so I'd like your own view about this, do you think that Mr Johnson did actually think not only that the country was well equipped to deal with the disease and that there were systems and plans in place, but that actually even more fundamentally it wasn't really a dangerous disease at all?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I do underline the point I made earlier, I'm not sure of the timing of these things, but my memory is that at that stage it was not seen as the disease it -- the seriousness that it became apparent later on. We're right at the beginning of this. It hadn't really hit Europe. It was still very, very new.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Right.

Let me move on, Lord Lister, and ask you some questions about another matter, and this relates to some of the early COBR meetings that took place, in fact in early March, and the question of whether the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, should or shouldn't have been invited to those meetings.

We can start, in fact, on this page that we're looking at, which is convenient. If we could look at -- that's it -- paragraph 22, (ii), you are recording here, and there is a list, is there not, of things that you know you did relating to Covid which I imagine you took from an email review. You record here that on 9 March the Mayor of London, that is Sadiq Khan, asked to attend, as we will see, in fact it was a particular COBR meeting, and that you refused the request and suggested a meeting of mayors with Matt Hancock.

I would like to take you back in the chronology a little bit to explore what took place.

If we can start, please, by going to Sadiq Khan's witness statement, which is INQ000221436, and page 16 of that statement. It will come up on screen.

We can see here that -- we'll remember that the date of your email, which you referred in your statement, was 9 March, so we have gone back a few days, and Mr Khan says that he recalls that there was a COBR meeting on 2 March. He said:

"It was about the sixth COBR meeting focusing on Covid-19."

He hadn't been invited to attend any of the previous meetings. He asked his government relations team to contact Number 10 requesting that he attend the 2 March meeting, given, as he said, that London was clearly one of the most at-risk places in the country due to its large number of airports and international travellers and high-density population.

If we very briefly just look at the paragraph above, we can see that on the same day he'd been told by Dr Jenny Harries that five of the 35 confirmed cases in the UK, so 15% or thereabouts, were in fact from London.

Just to follow from that, if we can go to a document, please, which relates to this exchange.

It's INQ000118937. Yes, thank you.

So here we see -- we can look at the bottom half of the page first -- an email sent on 28 February, which was the end of the week before 2 March, from Sadiq Khan's team to Clare Brunton, which is a name we will see several times in these exchanges, at Number 10, and we see that this person contacts Clare Brunton and relays a request from the mayor's chief of staff for the mayor to attend the COBR meeting on Monday, that was 2 March, and again we see:

"Given its large number of airports, hospitals and international visitors, London is of course potentially one of the most at risk places."

Pausing there, that would seem to be quite a good reason for the Mayor of London to attend COBR?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Perhaps because I had been so involved with London government and because I've also been involved heavily with the other local authorities up and down the country, always at the back of my mind was the accusation which would come at the mayor that he was treating London differently to the rest of the country, and my view was then, it stayed all the way through the Covid crisis, that you had to treat all parts of the country equally and give them the same kind of access as London, and if you for one minute allowed London in without inviting the others there would nothing but difficulty and problems.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We will come to see that that was why you stopped the mayor attending a subsequent meeting, but -- one can see that that's a sensible perhaps starting point, but if one has a disease which is affecting London more immediately or where the risk of the disease seems to be more focused or acute, really, do you -- is there some sort of prohibition on recognising the fact that the Mayor of London in that situation might be more deserving of a seat at COBR than other regional mayors?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yeah, but where do you draw the line on this? And also, I mean, as you said earlier, it was a relative -- it was a large number in proportionate terms, but it was still a relatively small number in London, the rest were outside London. Where do you draw the line on this?

The mayor -- sorry, the Prime Minister subsequently agreed to the mayor coming about, I don't know, a week later. You'll have the --

**Counsel Inquiry**: We'll come to it.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: But my point is it was always about parity with the rest of the country and treating all parts of the country in the same way.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, we can take this more quickly now. I mean, to be fair, your name doesn't appear on these emails. Can you tell us at this distance whether you were on involved on this date or not?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Which one?

**Counsel Inquiry**: We're looking at the emails from 28 February, Lord Lister. We'll come to see the ones which bear your name a week or so later. It may not matter much but do you know whether you were involved on this occasion?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I probably was but I can't confirm 100%.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In any event we see that what happened was that the message went back to say that the Mayor of London would not be invited to that COBR meeting.

Then we see, if we can go on to a different document, please, INQ000214135, the same type of exchange on 8 March, so let's say a week or so later. If in fact we look at the email on the very bottom, again there is a member of the Mayor's team emailing Clare Brunton:

"... following reports COBRA will meet again [tomorrow] re Coronavirus, the Mayor's view is that he should attend this meeting, given the potential impact on London and Londoners. I know a request was declined for him to attend the previous meeting [that's the one we just looked at], but given the increased spread, we feel it is even more appropriate that he be there tomorrow. Can you let me know please ..."

Then if we go back to the page before, we see Clare Brunton I think contacting you saying:

"I assume the answer is no again?"

You saying -- if we just leave it without it being enlarged, we can just read up, I think.

Then in the middle of the page you saying, just underneath where it says "On 9 March" you say:

"No but I do think there needs to be a meeting of Mayors perhaps with Matt Hancock."

Then there is another email from Clare Brunton, these are all happening within a few minutes of each other, saying that the matter had been discussed at the 8.15 meeting, presumably without you, and that the "general view from the room" was that there is an argument for Sadiq Khan being at the meeting.

And in response a few minutes later you say you can't have him there without Street, that's the Mayor of West Midlands, Andy Burnham et al, "or is London more important than Manchester". So this is the view you've just expressed?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And we know that as a result of that he wasn't invited to that meeting.

Just one more time, then, it really -- is that sort of basic "you can either have all of them or none of them" approach really appropriate at a time where there is a developing virus and there are perhaps good reasons to think it's affecting London more immediately, more seriously than other places?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Well, I ... I did believe there should be regular meetings with the mayors, and that's something that should be taking place, but I did believe that to actually single out one authority over another would be a mistake.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just to complete the story, if we can go back to Sadiq Khan's witness statement, so that's INQ000221436, we can see, if we go to page 18, please, we can see -- and we don't need to zoom in, we can just look briefly -- we can see that he refers, having been not invited on 9 March to COBR, on 11 March he had a meeting with Chris Whitty. And then if we look on paragraph 77, about halfway down, he says:

"We had a wide-ranging discussion [that's him and Chris Whitty], covering the way in which the situation was thought likely to develop ... noting that the highest concentration of cases in the country was in London, which was not surprising given the density of its population and status as a major transport hub."

So in fact Chris Whitty appears to be confirming the concerns that Sadiq Khan had earlier expressed. Then further down the page we see that there was in fact a COBR meeting the next day on 12 March. Again he asked to attend, again he was told he could not, and -- the next page, please -- it's only the week after that, on first time. That's paragraph 82.

So Lord Lister, just finally on this, on reflection, in hindsight, given that sequence of events and the documents we've looked at, do you think perhaps you or the system ought to have been readier to make an exception to that rule you've described and invite Sadiq Khan -- as in fact, as we can see, he was on the 16th -- a week or so earlier?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: And -- yes, and I -- I think perhaps we should have moved -- or I should have authorised it earlier. But

I was always concerned about this treating London differently from the rest of the country, and in fact later on in Covid that became much more of an issue than it was at the beginning. But in hindsight, perhaps it would have been right to have done it earlier, but I -- that worry was always at the back of my mind.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Right. Well, I want to take you forward, then, in time, please, and let's talk about the first lockdown.

If we can start, please, on page 11 of your statement, paragraph 26, you state here that:

"By 23 March ... it had become clear that a lockdown was needed to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed, to buy us time until a vaccine was developed and to March, that Sadiq Khan was invited to COBR for the                    16           underline the seriousness of the situation to the public." And I won't take you to it, but there is another paragraph of your statement where you state explicitly, perhaps it's implicit here, that you accepted, and still accept, that the first lockdown was justified at the time and in the circumstances that it was ordered?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think what we believed at the beginning of March was that there was a plan that was there that could be used.

There was the belief that herd immunity was the answer to the problem, and that the quicker we actually all caught it, the quicker we would have immunity from it, and that -- that to some extent remained true, except of course that the death toll would have been unbelievably high and totally unacceptable, and therefore it was -- became absolutely clear that herd immunity was not a policy option that was open to the government, and that a lockdown was the only solution.

But there were a lot of concerns about bringing the lockdown in. I mean, there was the worry about education, there was the worry about the economy, I mean, they were all there and they've all been spelt out, but it was felt that this was the only answer and I go along with that. I think at that particular point in time it was the right solution.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you, and in fact in the next paragraph of your witness statement you give us a lengthy list, it goes on for several pages, of what you described as the key challenges the government faced at this time, by which I think you mean perhaps just before and then during --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- the first lockdown.

I wonder if we -- I'm not -- I will pause at one or two of them, but if we scroll through we can see then what you regarded as being those key challenges: testing, social care -- if we can go on to the next page, please -- public health legislation, the devolved administrations. I'll come back and ask you some further questions about that. You mention the issue of PPE.

Go to the next page, please.

We can just cast our eyes down, there is a series of issues there.

Next page, please, and the next page.

You've mentioned the closure of educational establishments as being one matter of particular concern, Lord Lister. Was that a factor as you regarded as one which was being considered as a reason not to lock down or was it something that was --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No, I --

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- a factor in terms of trying to unlock as quickly as possible?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: It was more a question of trying to unlock as quickly as possible. I think I have said earlier in my statement that I believed that once it became obvious, and I think it became obvious once we started to see what was happening in Italy, lockdown was an inevitable outcome.

But it wasn't a pain-free option. We knew that once you moved into lockdown there would be other people who wanted to access health for other reasons who would not be able to. We knew that there would be problems with education, that -- the economy, and I can go on on all those things, but that had to be balanced against the terrible prospect of deaths, which -- which was just an unacceptable position, and there was really no choice at that time.

But I'm just trying to -- what I was trying to do was trying to say that it wasn't a pain-free decision, it was right that government should try to see what -- what the consequences of what they were doing was going to be.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. And we've looked through that range of issues which you describe as being in play at the time, and we can look to the bottom of this page, it includes, of course, a factor that you have already raised, which is retail and business.

Is it fair to assume, then, that this list, which at its outset you were clear was not, as it were, an exhaustive list, but this list was the types of issues that you recall being raised with the Prime Minister or those around him during this period?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes. They were all things that were discussed, because there were -- there was a great deal of concern about all of those things, and ...

There was an acceptance we had to go towards lockdown and we would probably have to do lockdown, but there were going to be effects from that which we needed to take into account and try to see if we could mitigate them. And I think I picked up there, when I talk about testing, testing wasn't an option, there was virtually no testing available, so we couldn't really test anybody. We were worried about social care and what was going to happen with social care. All of these things were issues that we were actively talking about and worrying about.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Last thing before I move on, it's a long list there, as I've said you don't describe it as being an exhaustive list, but one, at least one issue which is notable by its absence is any question of the great increase in domestic abuse that took place once lockdown was ordered. Is that missing from the list because it wasn't considered or can you tell us that it was?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No, it was -- it was certainly considered but I'm not sure it was considered right at the start of lockdown, I don't think that was one that was particularly high on the list. I don't think people had thought about it as being a likely outcome from it.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I mean, in hindsight, yes, it should have been and it became an obvious discussion point later on, but by then we were in lockdown. And I'm still not sure what we could have done differently. If you're locking down, then you're locking down. That's one of the prices -- I mean, there are all sorts of other things, like young people stuck in halls of residence miles away from home and couldn't come home because we'd closed the transport network down. There were lots of other things that were also happening at that time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just to take you back to that, Lord Lister, your very lengthy career in local politics at a national level, it's an odd thing to hear you say that one identifies a problem and then just shrugs one's shoulders and says there's nothing --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Oh, no. No, no, I'm not saying that. I'm sorry, if I gave that impression, then I unreservedly apologise for that. All I'm trying to say was that was not an issue right at day one when we were discussing lockdown. Lockdown was a very blunt instrument which was being used to try to stop the spread of Covid. There were all sorts of consequences from that. Yes, we should have thought much more about domestic abuse. It just didn't -- it wasn't discussed in my hearing until actually after we'd imposed lockdown.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. So not foreseen, but it's right, isn't it, that once one recognises that there is a problem there --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- or, for that matter, other similar problems with other vulnerable groups that are experiencing, let's say, a collateral impact of lockdown, there are lots of things that could be done to try to ameliorate the problem, aren't there?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes, and that was one of our worries: what do you do with -- this was never -- sorry, the list in my statement wasn't designed as an exhaustive list of all the issues.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No, I hope I made that clear.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: They were the number one issues, if I can put it that way, which were coming up, and we spent a lot of time going through them.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let me move on, Lord Lister.

At a later part of your statement, perhaps we can go to it, it's on page 16, paragraph 28, about five lines down, can you see where you say:

"In my view the first lockdown continued for longer than I believe was necessary."

Can you help us to understand that statement, please? Why do you think that, and is there a particular period that you think was inappropriate or that steps were not taken quickly enough in a more general sense to lift the lockdown?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: The concern was, as lockdown continued, the consequences of it were becoming more and more difficult, the concern about the economy was enormous, business wasn't flowing. I mean, if I take a very simple example, for example, sale of cars, how do you keep car factories going if you can't sell the car that's being produced? Therefore you've got no alternative but to end up needing to -- letting people go. And there were all sorts of problems. And by then -- the early part of lockdown everybody understood there was no choice, but as lockdown proceeded it became more and more difficult to keep these things going. And indeed we started to relax things, we started to relax things like garden centres and other things, large places. But the pressure from the public was enormous by then to open up. And that stayed there until the summer when we did open right up.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Pressure from the public, perhaps, but you seem to be expressing here your own view that things should have been done differently?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I -- my own view was that we needed to look at releasing the economy as quickly as possible and that the quicker we could do that the better. That was always my view. And once we started to see the numbers starting to improve -- and look, please, this sounds very cruel and hard, every death is a terrible thing and I'm not for one minute arguing that it isn't, but I am arguing you have to balance it all the time and that the pressures on the economy were enormous by then and the pressures from people, from business, everybody.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let's look at another document, if we can, and that is an email -- in fact it's from Stuart Glassborow, who the Inquiry heard from yesterday.

Yes, that's it.

I know you're familiar with this email, Lord Lister. At the bottom of this email is a read-out, a summary, is it not, by Stuart Glassborow, who, as we recall, was the Prime Minister's deputy personal private secretary, a read-out of a meeting that had taken place between Mr Johnson and the Chancellor, and he is sending that read-out to you.

We see that in the meeting that he is describing there had been a discussion between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor where, as we see from the very first couple of lines of the main paragraph:

"... the Chancellor re-iterated the implications for the economy of the current lockdown measures if they persisted."

And then I won't read the rest out but we see that the theme is similar to the one you were just describing, the Chancellor in summary urging greater progress on opening the economy up.

We see further up the page you asking to be involved in a follow-up meeting.

Is this a fair reflection of what was happening at the time? Do you recall the Chancellor really taking up that course that you've just been describing and urging the Prime Minister to move faster, opening up the economy?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I don't think it was just the Chancellor, I think it was really anybody that was looking at economic factors that were at play at that point in time. There was also pressure from other sectors to open up. It was beginning to be worrying about what was happening to the economy, and there was a constant stream of messages coming back from various industries that they were going to have to start letting people go, close down, they were running out of money, and it was at this time that various subsidiaries were being put into various places to keep things going.

**Counsel Inquiry**: It's hardly surprising in one sense that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is advocating within government for government to take steps to protect the economy, after all that's, you might think, his job, but in this particular context, where there is a pandemic afoot and a balance to be struck between health risks, as we've been discussing, and damage to the economy, did you understand the Chancellor's role to be simply advocating for that economic side of the argument, or did you think that he was himself trying to come up with his own assessment of the balance between health risks and economic damage?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I don't think I'm really sure on the answer to that one. Certainly, as you quite rightly say, it was his job to represent the economy, it was my job, as part of my role in Number 10, to also represent business as well, all of whom were pushing hard for some relaxation because of the consequences of this. I think the rest of that you'll have to ask the Chancellor.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, we will, but I'm still interested in your understanding of the dynamic at the time, because we've heard some evidence that some of the scientists involved in SAGE and so on took the view that the Chancellor was striking the wrong balance in this period and arguing too forcefully for economic matters and causing a risk, and in fact we heard yesterday some evidence that the Prime Minister himself referred to what was described as "pro death" squads from the Treasury. One doesn't, of course, want to put too much weight on a few words, but what I want to ask you, with your experience and presence there at the time, is: what was the understanding? Was the Chancellor perceived as someone who was simply advocating at every step for the economy, or was there a feeling that he was trying, and in some eyes failing, to strike the right balance between economic risk and health concerns?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think everybody was trying to strike that balance, and I think it was a situation where you either erred a little bit more on the economic argument or you erred more on the health argument. I mean, it could be argued if you -- if you like, that the health representatives who attended the various meetings with the Prime Minister, I don't think we would have come out of lockdown that summer, they would have kept us there, even though the data was showing a marked improvement in the situation.

And therefore that this was a sort of constant discussion that was taking place -- "argument" I think is too strong a word -- it was a discussion that was going on all the time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: With the Prime Minister right at the centre of it?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And as, in fact, we've seen earlier today, having to make some extremely difficult decisions?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Before we move on, I just want to ask you one more thing about this document. If we can look at the very bottom of this page, and it will mean we go over on to the next page:

"The PM and Chancellor agreed on the need to undertake measures that would power the economy, giving the best shot at as full and fast a bounce back as possible. This would likely focus on supply side reform, eg on planning."

Well, this is in May, it wasn't that much later, was it, that the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was introduced, not about planning, but fairly described as something on the supply side --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- of the economy?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think that's, by the way, where that thinking was predominantly.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Were you involved in the Eat Out to Help Out scheme?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No, I was -- I was aware of it, I was aware of the thinking behind it, I was aware of the discussions about the changes to the VAT rules, and what they would do, to try to kick start the hospitality industry. And it was the hospitality industry above all other industries that was the one that was most affected. It was there that the greatest number of company closures was taking place, people were losing their jobs, it was that part of the economy which was more seriously affected than any other part.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You weren't involved directly, from what you say, in the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, but again, given your experience and presence there in Downing Street at the time, would you have expected that scheme to have been developed in a way that calibrated the risk to health against the benefit that was sought to be achieved to the hospitality industry?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: But, if I may answer that, I'm now struggling to remember the numbers, I think it was at that time you could have no more than six, once we did open up -- it might have been four, I can't remember now the number, but there was a limit on the number of people that could gather together, so it was quite small groupings that were to be allowed, there was the 2-metre rule that was in place. These were things that were designed to try to make that as safe an opening as possible.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Doesn't that rather beg the question, Lord Lister, because one way of doing that sort of calibration that I suggest would be by a non-scientist like you, with respect, to undertake the sort of exercise you've just undertaken to say, "Well, there is not many people sitting round a table and there aren't going to be that many tables, so it will probably be safe"?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No, that whole policy piece about the design of the rule of six and how far people should be apart was something that was set up following discussion, advice with medical professionals, it wasn't somebody like me sitting round a table who came up with a rule of six.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, I want to go back to Eat Out to Help Out, because one obvious way of ensuring that that scheme struck the right balance, or at least understanding what balance it did in fact strike between economics and health, would be to have asked SAGE, which was after all the committee that had, as its function, providing expert epidemiological health advice to the government. And the evidence that we've heard was that SAGE was not consulted about the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. Would you have expected that to take place?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I can't answer whether SAGE was or was not consulted, but what I can say is that all of this was discussed at the 9.15 meetings. There were the Secretary of State for Health present, there were medical advisers present, all of it was done in discussion with those various people, and at the end of the day the Prime Minister in conjunction with his colleagues in the Cabinet made the decision.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just one more issue before we move on, and it's still on this question of striking the right balance and ultimately, following this discussion that you've described, the Prime Minister having to make what, in many cases, were very difficult decisions.

Are you able to help us a little bit more about the dynamics of all of this between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor? We've heard this afternoon in fact that later in the year, so in the autumn, where these discussions -- we'll come on to talk about this ourselves -- came back with a vengeance, there was a perception that the Prime Minister would make a decision, shall we say, favouring the health side of argument, only for that decision then to be, and the word used was, "undone" by the Chancellor, who would have another go at him and persuade him to change his mind.

Is that something that you recognise?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: What I recognise from that was that the Prime Minister was dealing with a series of -- there were no easy decisions here. Everything was a balance. And it was a very difficult balance to strike. And I think that at the various meetings there were different lobbies that were at play, the health lobby, some of the other ministers were pro-lockdown, others were wanting to open up. That was taking place all the time. So he was trying to steer a path through the middle of this, to the best of his ability and listening to the advice being given to him on both the economy and from the health professionals.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Were there occasions where it appeared that he'd made one decision and then one group or the other had a further meeting with him or discussion with him and he then changed his mind?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Well, any decision that was -- he did change his mind on wouldn't have been a decision that had been finalised by Cabinet or any other group, it would have been in discussions with his various advisers round the table, and I think that was more him weighing up the different options that were in front of him.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let me move on, Lord Lister, and I'm moving forward now perhaps a little further in the year, or perhaps we're still in the summer of 2020, and the evidence the Inquiry has heard about the culture of the working environment in Downing Street and Cabinet Office at the time is striking, and I'm sure you're familiar with what the Inquiry has heard. We've seen the paper that was written by Helen MacNamara and Martin Reynolds on that very issue. Do you think you saw that paper at the time?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: I'm not going to take you to it, but we will recall that summary: "superhero bunfight", junior women being talked over or ignored, various different aspects of an unhappy staff culture.

You were right at the centre at the time. What insight can you provide us with about all of that?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think there was a real tension at play at that time. I think it was largely driven by personalities. There were people there who were quite difficult to deal with, and I think there was a lot of tension that was taking place. I don't ... I think that there wasn't enough weight given to the view of some of the different people round the table. More weight should have been given than there was. But it was quite difficult to deal with it, there was a problem with -- and I mean -- I mean, you've heard from Dominic Cummings, you've heard other evidence, I mean, he was not an easy man to deal with, and that was a tension that was in the room.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Sorry to interrupt you, Lord Lister, when you say "he was not an easy man to deal with", you mean Mr Cummings?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, sorry, having interrupted you, let me ask you another question: you had worked with Mr Johnson, as we saw, for many years by this stage, including somewhere completely different, City Hall, for some time, and while there is a general understanding I think that Mr Johnson creates or enjoys a perhaps slightly chaotic working environment, I think it's clear that what was being described in the Reynolds/MacNamara paper was something quite a lot more than that.

Was there any comparison between the working environment in the Cabinet Office in the summer of 2020 and other places that you had worked with Mr Johnson? I suppose what I'm trying to ask you is: do you think Mr Johnson's sort of influence is part of the explanation for all this, or was it the very particular circumstances related to that place at that time?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: It was not like that when I worked for him in City Hall. I don't think anybody would ever suggest it was. It was -- there were better working relationships between the individuals, and I certainly have no memory of any one group being talked over. I think that was a feature of Downing Street. I think it was -- it's partly, I think, the tensions and the pressures of the place, which are enormous, and there's also a certain amount of this, about being -- people being very, very tired.

The working day in Downing Street is sort of 8 til 8 plus weekends, that's the norm for anybody who's working at the centre of it, so it's hardly surprising tensions do run high. I'm not saying that's acceptable, I think that it would have been better if the Prime Minister had dealt with it perhaps when the opportunity occurred to him in the -- certainly in the July of 2020, if not earlier. But he should -- there was a personality clash that was constantly going on, and it was -- there was an atmosphere.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Can I just take you to one WhatsApp reference which gives us some insight into your role, fairly limited role, in all of this.

Yes, that's the right page.

This is, to be clear, an exchange between Simon Case and Mark Sedwill. You don't seem to have received or contributed to these messages, but you are mentioned in them. We can see that on the 2 July, so that's a couple of months after the paper from Helen MacNamara and Martin Reynolds, Simon Case, who at this stage recently had come to Downing Street, or the Cabinet Office, says:

"At this rate, I will struggle to last six months. These people are so mad. Not poisonous towards me (yet), but they are just madly self-defeating."

Mark Sedwill says he will fix, and then:

"Yup! You're ok so far because you've been around for the good news phase. Wait until there are more Leicesters and then the fur will fly. Watch yourself.

Mark Sedwill says:

"As I pointed out to Eddie [and that's you, I take it] it's hard to ask people to [march, I think he meant] to the sound of gunfire if they're shot in the back."

And Simon Case says:

"I've never seen a bunch of people less well equipped to run a country. PM asked me today about who will replace Shinner when he goes ... I was quite direct in telling him that lots of the top-drawer people I had asked had refused to come because of the toxic reputation of his operation."

What these two very senior officials seem to be discussing between themselves and also, on this basis, discussing with you is a very extreme set of affairs, not just some personality clashes, but the sort of toxic culture which seems, as we can see from the last entry, in fact to be discouraging others from wanting to go and work in the Cabinet Office. Is that a fair reflection of how you saw things at the time?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Do you remember Mark Sedwill having that particular conversation with you or --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Not particularly, but I remember -- well, not those words, but I do remember similar conversations. We did speak together quite a bit about the need for change, and that it would have been easier if there was a change in the regime.

There were two problems. One was too much power was being taken to Downing Street because of the frustrations of things not being done elsewhere; in fact it wasn't the right answer to bring it to the centre, it should have been left in the departments and whatever the problem was corrected within the department. But also it was because some of the personalities just made it very, very toxic.

In fact, I mean, it's ... I'm jumping around the bush a little bit. I mean, I think the problem by then was that Dominic Cummings' relationship with other people had become very strained.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You were -- you remained in Downing Street for about another eight or nine months after this. Did the position carry on as bad as it's described here or did it improve particularly --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: It started to improve, really, after -- during the summer and afterwards it got a lot, lot better, I think because there wasn't quite the same drama and tension that there had been in the first -- the first lockdown, but also I think because the personalities had slightly started to change and people had moved on a little bit, and that -- I just think it got easier to deal with the problems.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Let me go to another topic, which is your involvement in relations between the government in London and the devolved administrations. Of course, I mean, the Inquiry has heard a fair amount of evidence now on that issue. We saw right at the start of your evidence that, prior to the pandemic, one of your areas of responsibility had been overseeing relations between the UK and Ireland in the context of the Brexit negotiations.

Did you have a role, once the pandemic started, in liaising with the devolved administrations about the measures that were taken to combat the pandemic?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I had a role in so much that we had regular meetings with the devolved administrations. I was able to make calls to various people, and did do at various times, because of issues that arose. So yes, I was involved.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You referred in your witness statement -- I don't think we need to go there, we can if we need to -- to what you describe as "Four Nations Forums". Were those the same things as the regular telephone calls or perhaps Zoom calls that Michael Gove had with the leaders of the devolved administrations?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Michael Gove had the more formal meetings, but there were quite regular discussions which the Prime Minister was involved with, when various issues were -- at various points during the Covid pandemic there were these calls, these regular Zoom calls which took place between the leaders.

**Counsel Inquiry**: So you're not referring to any special or sort of --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No, no, there was --

**Counsel Inquiry**: It's just what you call them?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I mean, the four nation forum, I think, was the formal name of the ministerial group which was led by Michael Gove.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We'll come to one or two particular issues, but in general terms, what was your take on the state of relations during this emergency between London and the devolved authorities -- sorry, the devolved administrations?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think they went very smoothly, or relatively smoothly -- nothing went smoothly, but relatively smoothly with Northern Ireland and with Wales, and it was fairly tense with Scotland.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, let me explore that by moving on in the chronology, because the evidence the Inquiry has heard is that, as 2020 passed and in particular once in the summer of 2020 the lockdown step-by-step was lifted, that was the point at which the policies that were being pursued in England and in the devolved nations started to diverge, and it was a consequence of that divergence that there were tensions developed between the devolved nations, and in particular calls made -- by Mark Drakeford and Nicola Sturgeon, at least -- for there to be more sort of centralised decision-making, calls for COBR meetings, or a joint ministerial council to be held.

Is that a fair summary? Do you recognise that description of how the relations went?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We've also heard that Boris Johnson was opposed to what he described as, as it were, federal decision-making. He felt that it would be wrong -- and I'm paraphrasing a part of his witness statement -- wrong for, as it were, himself and the leaders of the devolved nations to meet together to decide on measures; rather, he should simply decide what should happen and the devolved nations should be informed and attempts made to accommodate them.

Again, have we got that right, and what were your views about that issue?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think -- I think the Prime Minister felt very strongly there needed to be one UK message being pushed out, and there were various disputes with -- particularly with Scotland, over some of that messaging. There was an issue that pretty much each -- each step of the lockdown release required some change to rules or regulations in one form or another, and to try and get agreement amongst all the devolved authorities was very difficult.

By and large, Wales and Northern Ireland went along with Britain, with England, maybe with some small modifications or changes or maybe they influenced those to -- and their changes could be incorporated. But with Scotland, it was always that whatever the announcement was, Scotland wanted to do it a day or two earlier than England, or a week later, or it never wanted to do it at the same time, and that created a great deal of distrust within the organisation, and a lot of frustration.

**Counsel Inquiry**: The starting point, perhaps, is that health was a devolved issue --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- in each of the devolved nations, so they were entitled -- more than entitled, they were under a duty -- to make their own decisions on health issues within the different nations. I mean, that must be right?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: That's right, and in each of them there was a chief medical officer, and the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, used to have regular meetings with his opposite numbers, the chief medical officers of those devolved administrations. That, I think, all worked pretty smoothly and pretty straightforwardly; it was the politics that was always the problem, and this -- it seemed to us in Downing Street that it didn't matter what the decision was, Scotland would always want to do it slightly differently to England.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Let me take you to the part of your witness statement that you draw -- where you draw attention to this point. Yes, thank you. It's (iv), and we can see here you say that the co-operation was "less effective in the case of the Scottish administration", and then as you say, "keen to announce measures either before or after the rest of the UK", and then this, "for reasons that appeared more political than data-driven".

Well, the Scottish administration did have the political authority and duty to make those decisions, so what do you mean by "political" in that paragraph?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think there was a real desire by the Scottish Government to always show that they were not doing the same as England and that they were running a different operation in Scotland and that they were, in their view, doing things better. It was just -- but it always -- almost seemed that there was the desire just to be different.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Opportunistic?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think that's a good word.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And it's implicit in everything that you've said that this was a source of frustration in Downing Street?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: It was a frustration, it was just -- it -- look, you're making a decision at a COBR decision or whatever to change a rule, and then you find out that the change has just been done in Scotland the day before or three days later, and then there were also arguments about some of the messaging that had to be put out. It just caused confusion.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Was this sense of frustration one of the reasons why Boris Johnson was reluctant to meet the leaders of the devolved administrations?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Well, he -- he largely used Michael Gove for those meetings --

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: -- and he delegated that responsibility to Michael Gove to do that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, quite. So he -- as I said, we've seen evidence that in particular Mark Drakeford in the autumn of 2020 called for there to be meetings, a JMC or a COBR meeting, on different occasions; and the answer, at least on occasions, was: well, no, we won't have a meeting of the heads of the government but Michael Gove will meet with you on a Zoom call.

That's what I mean by perhaps reluctance of Mr Johnson to engage in that type of meeting. Do you think that this sense of frustration could have been one cause of that?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes. I mean, I think there was a constant feeling by him that whatever he was going to say, they were going to play politics with it and do something slightly different, and that was -- that was what happened time after time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You referred, Lord Lister, to messaging, communications, and there's a document I -- well, just pause there before I take you to the document.

Yes, let's go to the document. We've got it here. In fact it's a document the Inquiry has seen before, but it dates from May 2020, so again when -- sort of around the time of the first lockdown being lifted.

In summary -- I know you've seen this document before -- there was a request, was there not, from the Scottish Government that the new "Stay Alert" campaign which was being used in replacement for the old "Stay at Home" campaign, shouldn't be used in Scotland because it didn't reflect the policies being pursued by the Scottish Government?

If we read to the bottom of the numbered points, ultimately the recommendation was that the Scottish Government's request should not be met, that the campaign should be run nationwide, and I think we've heard from an earlier witness that that's what happened.

Wasn't the Scottish Government, with its devolved responsibility for health, entitled to ask the London government not to broadcast a campaign in Scotland that didn't reflect Scottish Government policy?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think this was the argument, that it was just causing confusion with too many different messages going out to people, it was hard enough trying to have one coherent message going out all the time, and the general view was that it was essential to stick to one message, and that was clearer, easier and better to do that.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Doesn't that reasoning simply not meet the point that in this area of health, under the devolution settlement, it was for the Scottish Government to decide how the pandemic was going to be tackled in Scotland?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yeah, but when you've got national newspapers, national television stations, national things, you can't suddenly start having different messages. The same adverts were going out on television right across the country.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Well, one way of addressing this which has been mentioned in evidence is that at press conferences, as you say, which clearly were going out across the UK, the Prime Minister should make it clear, if necessary, that certain measures or certain campaigns didn't apply to Scotland. But more fundamentally than that, given the devolved responsibility of the devolved administrations, if the English campaign wasn't something that they were happy with, wasn't that a reason not to run the campaign at all?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: But you can't not run campaigns through -- through the course of the pandemic. There was a series of campaigns being run in newspapers, on television, and there was a very strong view coming from the media side at Number 10 was that you had to have one simple message that goes to everybody.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And the person to decide on that one simple message was Boris Johnson?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Well, he's the Prime Minister.

**Counsel Inquiry**: He's the Prime Minister of a country, parts of which had their own responsibility for health.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: But he also had a very clear responsibility about the pandemic, to do the best he could for the whole country, and that was the view he took. Although I've got to say to you I think most of this was really discussed within the media operations of the Cabinet Office and Number 10.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Looking back on it, clearly there was conflict, tension; you've described your understanding that there was a certain amount of political game playing. Do you think if the governments of the four nations had tried harder to work together and settle their differences that there could have -- that some of these problems could have been overcome?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I've got ... I've got to say, I think that actually the Prime Minister at the COBR meetings with -- and meetings that Michael Gove had, everybody tried very hard to have coherent messages and to work together. It was just difficult with Scotland. It was ... I mean, I don't remember any disputes -- I mean, not major ones -- with Wales or Northern Ireland, or disputes which weren't resolved relatively amicably.

**Mr O'Connor**: Lord Lister, I'm going to move on to the last of the topics that I have questions for you about, and that's the --

**Lady Hallett**: Can I just ask roughly how long? I'm not pinning you down, it's just that I've been asked to take a break, but if it's not going to be that -- I know Ms Mitchell's got some questions.

**Mr O'Connor**: Yes. Well, it's not going to be a couple of minutes, it's going to be probably maybe 10 or 15.

**Lady Hallett**: Well, I'll take a 4-minute break.

*(4.27 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(4.31 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Mr O'Connor.

**Mr O'Connor**: I'm grateful, my Lady.

Lord Lister, I'm going to move on to, as I said, my last area, which is to ask you some questions about things that took place in the autumn and winter of 2020, going over into 2021. In fact, the Inquiry has heard from Mr Ridley today a fair amount of evidence about that period.

We know, of course, infection rates started to rise at the end of the summer and into the autumn, there were calls from SAGE and others for the so-called circuit breaker lockdown from September. That's the context.

If we could look, please, at paragraph 32 of your witness statement, which is on page 17, you make very much the same point: the R number was rising in September 2020, the proposal for the circuit breaker. However, you say, the opposition to any form of lockdown was intense.

Then this: you recall the PM saying in September 2020 that he would rather "let the bodies pile high" than impose another lockdown. You go on to say it's an unfortunate turn of phrase.

Can you help us with the occasion on which the Prime Minister said this, or to whom he said it?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No, I can't, I can't recall. I mean, it was at one of the many meetings that were going on, and I can't tell you which one.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No. What did you take him to mean by it?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think it was just the ... we'd had the summer, hospitality had opened up, there was immense pressure to keep the economy moving forward, and the R number was starting to rise, particularly in the north of England, and this was beginning to lead to quite a few pressures from the Department of Health and from the Health Secretary for a lockdown to be put in place as soon as possible. And this was the debate that was going on: do you now lock down or do you keep going? By now we were starting to see vaccines coming through, things were starting to look a bit brighter than they had been earlier.

**Counsel Inquiry**: In terms of vaccines?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Well, no, generally. Generally things were looking brighter than they had been in the first lockdown. There was a feeling that: could we hold off, could we find an alternative to locking down? And it also that the R number, although it was rising, was not rising at the same rate in all parts of the country.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We'll come on to the tiers shortly, but just before we leave this: it's one thing to have a debate about locking down or not locking down, of course issues between the harm that a lockdown would do and the health risks that might seem to indicate a lockdown is needed, but to say that "Let the bodies pile high" is a very striking term --

**Lady Hallett**: I think that's a question for the former Prime Minister, rather than Lord Lister.

**Mr O'Connor**: I'll move on, Lord Lister, to ask you about the tier system.

As you say, and in fact if we move to paragraph 33 of your witness statement, we see you make the point that the R number was not the same in different parts of the country, and it was in October of 2020, was it not, that this tier system was introduced and you played quite a significant part in trying to implement it; is that right?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Counsel Inquiry**: And what was your role?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: My role was to try and get an agreement in the different parts of the country where the R number was going up to basically establish a tiering system, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 -- Tier 3 basically being total lockdown -- and it was an attempt to try and find an alternative to a national lockdown, and therefore do it on a regional basis, and try and keep the economy, as much as of it as we could, moving forward.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You say you were negotiating or trying to make agreements with the local authorities. Perhaps it's obvious, but presumably it was with those authorities and the regions that were proposed to be put into the higher tiers --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yeah. I mean --

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- that a discussion needed to be had?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yeah. Basically the number was rising, particularly in the north, there was some movement in the Midlands, but it was mainly a northern phenomenon at that point in time. Later it changed again, but at that moment it was particularly high in areas like the northwest, and that's why we started the negotiations in Warrington, we started in Liverpool. It was those areas that were seen as the ones with the highest -- highest threat at that time.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We've heard about Liverpool and Manchester, but just give us an idea: were there in fact quite a number of different regions, a number of different negotiations under way?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes, I mean, basically the whole of the north and the Midlands was subject to different negotiations under way. I mean, in the northwest, for example, there was one going on with the Lancashire authorities, which was a group of authorities; in Manchester, it was the metro mayor; in Merseyside, it was a metro mayor; in Warrington, we had another one; and we had one in Cheshire. So, I mean, we had different negotiations there, and then that was reflected right across the northeast and the north generally.

**Counsel Inquiry**: We've heard in fact from Mr Ridley this afternoon his views about tiering system, and perhaps his fundamental view was that because of circumstance -- which we'll come on to -- it wasn't given long enough to prove itself or not. But he did also identify a number of built-in problems with the tiering system, and one of them we've just really been talking about, which is that it necessarily involves a series of negotiations with quite a large number of different authorities, which experience proved were difficult and lengthy.

On that, were there to be another situation in which a system like this was envisaged, do you think that the necessity to have all these different negotiations with different authorities is a reason in itself to mean that a tiering system is simply unachievable, or not?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think we tried to bring in the tiering system by agreement with each of the authorities, and the problem was that each one wanted to try and get a bit more money than the last one. So the negotiations were, by their very nature, difficult. And one of the things that I did do right at the beginning of the negotiations was to assure anybody that we did a deal with that, if later on with some other authority we'd come to something slightly different, that retrospectively that would apply to them, so nobody was going to lose out.

But it was tense and was difficult. The local authorities did not want to close their hospitality industry down. It had only just started to get back on its feet. There was immense opposition to it, and the problem with it was we were trying to do it on a regional basis, which I think was right, was the only thing we could do, but of course within a region things weren't always the same.

I mean, a good example, Manchester. I mean, the high number, the high R number there was in Bolton, that was our biggest problem, while Stockport had a very low R number. But that was just within one region, but we were trying to impose a tiering system which would be for all of Manchester or all of Merseyside.

So it was -- it was messy, but I think it was the right thing to do and I think we, by and large, got agreement to most of it by most authorities, and I think if we'd kept it going it -- well, I believe it would have worked, but in the end there was a decision taken just before Christmas to bring in a circuit breaker and to stop it.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

Let me just ask you about one other of the problems identified by Mr Ridley. It really follows from what you have just been saying, that quite apart from, he said, the difficulty of the negotiations, one ended up with an incredibly complex situation with a whole series of different regions, different rules applying in different regions, the need to draft different regulations for different regions and then all the confusion on the ground that stemmed from that.

Again, do you think that those were the types of problems which in the end could have been overcome and perhaps in the future, in another pandemic, could be?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I would like to think we could overcome them. I think we were starting to overcome them. I think we'd got a coherent set of regulations. I mean, once we'd done the first couple, the rest were largely copies of those regulations. Yes, there was a bit of confusion, you know, why was Manchester different from Merseyside or wherever, but by and large I think the local people understood what was going on in their communities and it was a price worth paying to try and keep their economy open, and that was seen as valuable and worthwhile.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Thank you.

Now, as you say, the experiment with the tiering system in fact only lasted a month or so, or less, because the second lockdown was introduced at the beginning of November. Then, as we know, in January there was a third lockdown introduced after Christmas. You have expressed a view in your statement in a number of paragraphs that you didn't think that either of those two lockdowns should have been imposed.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I believed that the tiering system was going to work. I think that it wasn't given long enough. I think we could have got through to the other side of Christmas without the circuit breaker. I also believe that by the time we did bring in the final lockdown, by then I don't think -- I just think the tiering system wasn't given enough time or enough of a chance to succeed.

**Counsel Inquiry**: You also mention at various places the vaccines, but it's -- you mention them, I think, in relation to both the second and the third lockdown, but in fact the vaccines didn't really get going until into the New Year, did they? So at least at the time those two lockdowns were introduced, they weren't really a feature?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No, they were just being started, we'd started with relatively low numbers in the autumn, early autumn, and it was being ramped up pretty steadily through into the New Year, when it was really beginning to then become a major factor. But we knew the vaccine was there, we knew it was coming, and there was a feeling that with local tiering, and if the R number went up sufficiently high, we would close down that area completely, which was the plan. I still think that could have worked, but it wasn't to be.

**Counsel Inquiry**: No.

I think the last point, Lord Lister, can we look, please, at paragraph 37 of your statement on page 18. This is one of the passages where you're expressing the view that the second -- in this case the second lockdown should not have taken place, but I want to ask you about a sentence about six or seven lines down where you say:

"There was no evidence that young people were badly affected by Covid-19 but the argument was that it was necessary to protect their parents and ... grandparents ..."

And so on.

By the end of 2020, it was clear, wasn't it, that Long Covid could and did cause serious illness in young people? Is that fair?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I'm not sure, I think it was later than that when Long Covid became the issue it became. I think it was still not really understood at that point in time. It certainly wasn't a major factor in the -- in the autumn of 2020. It certainly was by 2021, but I don't remember it in the autumn.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes. Well, I don't want to spend time going over the details. In fact, what's probably more important is your own understanding. So we know, for example, that there had been some Department of Health sponsored meetings and so on in the summer and the early autumn of 2020; but was your position, doing the best you can, from let's say October/November 2020 -- help us, were you thinking of Long Covid as a factor at that stage or not?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No. I was much more concerned about the economic effects of lockdown. I was -- I suppose it was inevitable because I was spending all my time talking to leaders of local authorities, I was very much involved about what was happening in those local authorities, about the need to get the economy moving, the worry they had about people losing jobs, all of that. So for me that was the priority, and I was very much involved in trying to do that, and I had to -- it's worth just making the point: those negotiations were not one way, it was a two-way negotiation, because I was also negotiating with the Treasury, because the sums of money had to be agreed. So it was quite a complex period.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Yes.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: But I still believe that ... well, we'll never know, but I do think the tiering could have been given more of a chance.

**Counsel Inquiry**: Just sticking with this and Long Covid just for another question or so.

Of course we know that around this time, it was the time of the Great Barrington Declaration, we've seen references in some of the Prime Minister's documents to him worrying about the QALY issue and the age of Covid victims and so on, and so it was very much part of the debate that lockdowns were having a disproportionate impact on young people.

One point to make in that regard is the one I've made to you that Long Covid did have an effect on young people, but can you remember that being raised as an issue in your discussions --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No.

**Counsel Inquiry**: -- either in terms of the second lockdown --

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No, not particularly. I mean, I think the main issue that was coming up with young people was always the issue about school closures and the need to get schools back.

**Mr O'Connor**: Yes.

Well, thank you very much, Lord Lister, those are all my questions.

My Lady, there is one set of questions from the core participants.

**Lady Hallett**: Ms Mitchell.

Questions From Ms Mitchell KC

**Ms Mitchell**: Thank you, my Lady.

I appear as instructed by Aamer Anwar on behalf of the Scottish Covid Bereaved.

Lord Lister, I'm going to ask you to look at an email communication which you were involved in, and can I ask that Inquiry numbered document INQ000214134 is placed up on the screen, and can we scroll down to the bottom, please.

Do we see here that a question is being asked that the FM is looking to have a call with the Prime Minister to discuss Covid-19 further, and a question is being made about availability.

Can we scroll up from that, and if we can zoom in on the response that, I think in blue. Becca is asking, and I think this includes you as you respond to it:

"Hi all

"What do you think of this?

"I think it would be near impossible to reject this request given the subject matter. I can ask for more info on what it's about specifically first?"

Then can we see your response to that, and I think your response there is:

"No choice but to do it.

"Ed."

Firstly I'd like to ask you: were you aware of any attempts by the Scottish Government to discuss Covid with the Prime Minister prior to this occasion?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I ... I have no memory of that. I'm sorry, I think I've got to say I'm not sure.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: We see from that line of communication that the word "further" is used, tending to indicate that there must have been some earlier communication; would you agree?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: If we can orientate ourselves, at this time -- this was, I think, the 5th -- that the request was made, 5 March, and that was on the date Covid-19 was added to the list of notifiable diseases.

From the text of this email chain, it appears that there's a reluctance to have the First Minister in contact with the Prime Minister.

What was the reason for that reluctance?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I ... well, I mean, as you can see from the exchange of emails, the meeting took place, so it -- I certainly wasn't trying to block that meeting taking place. But there was quite a lot of tension between the Prime Minister and the First Minister, they had no real personal relationship of any kind other than that they, I think, generally didn't like each other very much.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: But surely, given the nature of what was being discussed and the timing of the call, it would have been important for that to have taken place regardless of any views held personally?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yeah, and you will see from this exchange, I mean, that the call did take place.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: I'd like to move on, please, and it's a document that you've already been taken to. It's a part of your witness statement at paragraph 27, page 12, and the Inquiry number is INQ000237819.

This is the part that I would like to take you to about devolved administrations, and we've already had a look at this. You've indicated that, whilst there was good co-operation with Northern Ireland and Wales, it was less effective in the case of the Scottish administration, and you've made reference to "keen to announce measures either before or after". You describe this as more political than data driven.

The Inquiry, I think, in relation to this matter, has already heard evidence from a professor indicating that this particular message, the "Stay Alert" public messaging, was one which is the worst of all combinations because it doesn't tell you what to do and it tells you to worry.

This particular messaging aside, what other decisions taken by the Scottish Government do you consider were more political than data driven?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think it was really what I said earlier: whatever the decision that was taken at a COBR meeting that was in discussion with Wales, Northern Ireland, whatever that decision was, it would happen in Scotland as well, but it wouldn't happen on the same day. It would never be co-ordinated. There was always a desire for it to be a Scottish decision, not an English decision, and it was always the same decision, but it would happen two days earlier, two days later or whatever.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: So, when you say that the reasons appeared more political than data driven, what do you mean? That's not about the same message, is it?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: That is what I was meaning by that statement, that the data was saying we should do this or that, whatever it was, there was this desire for -- in Scotland, and please excuse me saying it, to be different all the time. And I think that was a political move rather than a practical move.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: I think the Inquiry has already heard a lot of evidence about the data suggesting that matters should have taken place earlier, and that decisions should have been taken earlier. Indeed, I think you yourself said so earlier. Might that, rather than simply being a desire to be different, in fact be something which was data driven, because you were trying to implement matters more quickly?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I mean, this was a general statement I was making right at -- right through the Covid period. There were at various times changes, there were rules which we were imposing across the country, the rule of six, the 2-metre rule, there were various other rules that were being developed, and I can't remember them all now, but, I mean, at the time they were -- they were very much sort of things you discussed every week, and it was just every decision that was taken, Scotland always went slightly differently in timing to the rest.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: You've mentioned the rule of six; I wonder if I can take you to paragraph 49 of your statement at page 21. You'll recall my learned friend has already asked you about this matter, and you explained it wasn't simply sitting round and deciding that six seemed like a good number, but it was made in combination with the experts.

I wonder if I can ask you to reflect on paragraph 49, where it says:

"Reductions in the ability for people to meet and later the 'rule of six' was interpreted far too harshly in my view. From memory the rule of six was an arbitrary number and this concept, as well as others such as household 'bubbles' were introduced as a means of compromise between isolation and full contact."

I wonder if I can ask you to reflect upon the view that you believe that the rule of six was an arbitrary number, and how that might square with your view that the decisions taken by the UK Government were more political than data driven?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I'm not arguing that the rule of six, and six was the right number. What I am saying is that along the line, you have to have a decision which is right across the UK, and so everybody understands whatever the rule is, and it was this constant pressure for something to be different, and that's really the point I'm trying to make.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: Well, the question, with respect, I'm asking is: did these decisions taken, the rule of six, represent a decision taken by the UK Government which was more political than data driven?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No, I don't think so, I think it was a -- it was the best compromise people could come up with, it was done in conjunction with medical advice that was given, it was also discussed extensively amongst the chief medical officers. These were things that were discussed quite widely before they reached a decision-making point.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: But then you describe the number that was chosen as arbitrary.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: My point is I am not sure, and I cannot remember why six was not four or six was not eight. It was a number that was decided at that time and that I was not party to making that decision. My point is I think it was, it did create all sorts of problems for people. I think it was very difficult, it was seen as being very unfair, and there were a lot of examples of that unfairness.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: I would like to turn now to a different issue, and to take you to an excerpt of some handwritten notes that were made, and they have been typed up. These are notes made by Patrick Vallance on 28 November 2020, or reflects a discussion at that time, and that is INQ000273901.

In order to orientate ourselves, if I may read:

"PM meeting re Tiers (advice from Gold).

"'We can't have endless boundary disputes. We have to make arbitrary and Draconian decisions.'.

"PM wanting to put more into Tier 1.

"CMO says 'I wouldn't put anyone in Tier 1 as Tier 1 all went up before & this Tier 1 is even less stringent.

"Selling the testing on 'Liverpool got out of this by testing' - not true -- it made a minor difference.

"also endless reference to what focus groups said ...

"Ed Lister 'all our feedback is that the more you put in Tier 1 the better' ...

"The exact opposite of what we need to do.

"This is all a game of getting votes.

"PM is the only rational voice in the political side ...

"[PM] arguing for going harder & says 'more jobs will go if this thing takes off again'.

"Simon Case comes in & says if you put everyone in lower tiers and then add Christmas we will undoubtedly have to do another national lockdown.

"PM 'What this disease has taught us is that hoping that something will turn up & it will be ok is fucking stupid'.

"Keeps coming back to hope that testing can help."

Now, what I want to ask you: do you remember that particular meeting?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: No. But I can remember that kind of argument.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: And the feedback which you were giving there, the feedback which you describe as "all our feedback is that the more you put in Tier 1 the better", what was that feedback from?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: That was -- that was the feedback from local authorities up and down the country who all wanted their hospitality sector opened up as soon as possible, and that was the general view, everybody wanted to be in Tier 1, so we were then having arguments in the north to move them to Tier 2 or ultimately to Tier 3.

**Ms Mitchell KC**: And would you agree that that feedback that you were giving at that time and the view you were expressing wasn't scientific feedback or data feedback, it was political feedback?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: It was political feedback but not party political feedback, it was political feedback from the -- from the leaders of local authorities up and down the country.

**Ms Mitchell**: Those are my questions, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Ms Mitchell.

Questions From the Chair

**Lady Hallett**: I've just got one question, Lord Lister.

Given what you described as the personality clash, particularly with Mr Cummings, and you having acted as an adviser to the Prime Minister, is there anything one could do to put in place any kind of structure about the role of the special adviser that might prevent this in the future, if you had such a personality clash, or is it inevitable?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think -- I think there's two -- can I answer it in two ways, if I may?

**Lady Hallett**: Yes.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: I think that you have to think about the way Boris Johnson likes to work: he's a journalist, he always likes to have both sides of the argument on the table. That was something, I suppose, as a journalist, he just automatically felt was the right thing to do in making a decision. One of the problems with people like Dominic Cummings is that they always believed that their decision or their view was the right view and there was no alternative view. That creates that tension. That's one issue.

The second issue is I think there wasn't a clear -- very clear line of responsibility in Downing Street, and I think that was a mistake, and I think there should have been clear lines, clearer responsibilities, and I think that would have eased the situation.

I also think people needed to be treated as little bit more respectfully than they were. Some of those WhatsApp messages, and you've seen them, are pretty appalling, and that's something that I felt very uncomfortable with.

**Lady Hallett**: You talk about clearer lines of responsibility, that's really what I was getting at and what has been occurring to me as I was listening to the evidence. But special advisers, I think they're temporary civil servants, aren't they?

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: Yes.

**Lady Hallett**: How could you create the clearer lines of responsibility? Because, although they're temporary civil servants, they answer to the minister rather than to the permanent secretary.

**Lord Edward Udney-Lister**: They are there to assist the -- to assist the minister, but, I mean, for them to be effective -- I think people need greater training to understand that in government, in the civil service, you can rarely get anything by instructing somebody to do it; you actually have to sell it to them, and sell it to them as being the right decision for the country, for whatever it is you're trying to sell. I don't think it's actually much different in business, actually. You always have to sell the message, and I think the idea -- and some of the special advisers I think had it -- was that they had the authority to act on behalf of the minister and just give instructions, and that just causes resentment and difficulty. And I think that's what you picked up from some of the earlier evidence that's been heard, and that's certainly how I read it.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much. Sorry to use you as if you were the author of a seminar. Thank you for your help.

*(The witness withdrew)*

**Lady Hallett**: Mr O'Connor?

**Mr O'Connor**: My Lady, that's the end of the evidence for today.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you. 10 o'clock tomorrow, please.
