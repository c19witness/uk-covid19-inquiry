7. Submissions on Behalf of the 13 Pregnancy, Baby and Parenting Organisations and Clinically Vulnerable Families by Mr Wagner
===============================================================================================================================

**Mr Wagner**: Thank you, and good afternoon.

I make submissions on behalf of two core participants, the 13 Pregnancy, Baby and Parent Organisations, which I'll refer to as the PBPOs, and the Clinically Vulnerable Families.

I act together with Mary-Rachel McCabe and Rosa Polaschek of Doughty Street Chambers, and we are instructed by Kim Harrison and Shane Smith, who sit either side of me, of Slater & Gordon.

I will make submissions first on behalf of the PBPOs, which I assume will take us to the lunch adjournment, and then, with your permission, continue after that.

I have four submissions to make on behalf of the PBPOs.

First, requesting that the Inquiry supplement its definition of maternity and antenatal care for the non-Covid conditions as they have been described.

Secondly, why we say that an expert should be instructed in relation to antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care.

Third, some comments on the key lines of enquiry for Every Story Matters, and fourth, some short points of response to CTI's and the other CPs' submissions that have been made today.

So, starting with the submission about the Inquiry's plan for investigating non-Covid conditions, the PBPOs very much welcome the Counsel to the Inquiry's confirmation that, in addition to the four identified non-Covid conditions to be examined in more detail, the Inquiry will also examine maternity and antenatal care. This, we say, is extremely important, and we are very grateful to the Inquiry for doing it. The PBPOs of course have extensive experience in these areas, from a range of perspectives, and are keen to offer the benefit of that experience and expertise to assist the Inquiry.

We appreciate the regular confirmation that the list of issues remains provisional, and in that respect we make a few short comments on those list of issues.

First, and overall, the PBPOs submit that the phrases "maternity and antenatal care" and "antenatal and postnatal care", which have been variously used in the list of issues and CTI's notes, are a little bit too narrowly expressed, because the language doesn't capture the range of issues which face pregnant women and birthing people in the healthcare systems during their pregnancies, birth and post-birth care as a result of Covid-19, nor those experienced by non-birthing parents and babies, as we have highlighted in the draft Rule 9 evidence which has now been provided to the Inquiry.

Just to give a couple of examples, amongst our group, The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust and the Miscarriage Association both support women and pregnant people who suffer ectopic pregnancies, usually before 12 weeks' gestation, and whose care is through specialist early pregnancy units rather than maternity care, and that may well not be considered under the current definition that the Inquiry's proposed.

Equally, Bliss supports babies born needing neonatal care, which is distinct from maternity care both in terms of its patient population and how it's commissioned and run.

Third, the Miscarriage Association also supports those experiencing miscarriage and molar pregnancy, which is also falling outside maternity care.

We note the helpful suggestion from the Scottish Covid Bereaved in their written submissions that the Inquiry may want to widen the scope of their enquiries in relation to maternity and antenatal care and consider the care and services provided to women who had suffered miscarriages and how this was impacted by the pandemic.

We also note their helpful point of information this morning that the Scottish Covid Inquiry may well be expanding its own definition of maternity and antenatal care to include miscarriage, and we entirely agree with all of that.

For those reasons we submit that the following broader phrase should be used in the list of issues: "early pregnancy, pregnancy, maternity, antenatal, neonatal, and postnatal care", which we say captures the full spectrum of issues which was experienced by women and birthing people and their families during the pandemic, and really would give the Inquiry a very full and holistic view on these issues.

It's also important that postnatal care is properly understood as extending beyond the hospital and into the community. It's typically understood to mean the minimum of six weeks' post-birth care, and again that's part of the broader picture.

Second on the list of issues, we submit that the Inquiry would also benefit from considering additional aspects of care as follows: firstly, a reference to guidance or advice for pregnant women in paragraph 21(d) of CTI's note should be expanded to include pregnant people and new parents for reasons of inclusivity, and this is the language that we have been using in our submissions from the beginning, and we ask that the Inquiry consider adopting that more inclusive language.

Secondly, we do understand CTI's rationale for using the catch-all phrase "visitor restrictions" in paragraph 21(e) in the note in the context of maternity care, but we submit that birthing partners of any kind, for example partners, mothers or friends, are much more than a mere visitor and in fact are an essential part of the caregiving team for the pregnant women or birthing person, and in our experience birthing partners provide essential care, such as helping to monitor the person giving birth, providing them with food or water, and helping them to go to the toilet, et cetera. Put simply, family members and supporters are not simply visitors, they are primary caregivers whose involvement in care delivery and decision-making is crucial to the baby's short-term and long-term developmental outcomes, as well as supporting good attachment and bonding. We say that it's important the language the Inquiry uses reflects that these categories are not viewed as an optional extra, and we therefore propose that a new phrase is used, "restrictions on visitors and other people supporting an individual's care".

A third point on the list of issues, we submit that there are other issues which the Inquiry should fully investigate under the umbrella of maternity and antenatal care, and we've listed them in our written submissions, but they are: guidance and care for neonatal babies and their families, provision and use of PPE in relation to babies and their families, access to bereavement care services for losses at all stages of pregnancy, including mental health care, access to treatment for women and pregnant people experiencing pregnancy complications and loss, and maternal deaths from Covid-19.

Those were my points on issues in the list of issues.

Moving on to expert evidence, the simple point is that we submit an expert should be instructed by the Inquiry in relation to the non-Covid condition, or however the Inquiry is describing it, of antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care. We have provided a couple of suggestions in our written submission, Professor Marian Knight and Dr Helen Mactier. We have a number of other suggestions which we can provide in writing after these submissions, but we do say that expert evidence will be hugely helpful to the Inquiry's investigation.

My third area to address is key lines of enquiry for Every Story Matters. Now, the categories that have been laid out by the Inquiry are obviously broadly drawn to cover a wide range of potentially affected persons, but we say Every Story Matters must draw out the experience of a wide range of people who needed to access early pregnancy, pregnancy, maternity, antenatal, neonatal and postnatal care during the relevant period.

In respect of bereavement, the PBPOs submit it would be appropriate to add a subparagraph addressing the experience of accessing bereavement support and the availability of bereavement support, including mental health care, and under the second bullet point we propose a subparagraph addressing the experiences of family members who were unable to be involved in decision-making and communication around end of life care or disposal of pregnancy remains. This reflects the experience of PBPO members and constituents who were sometimes prevented from being at crucial discussions due to visitor restriction rules.

Finally some brief points relating to CTI's and other core participants' submissions which the PBPOs support.

First, we note CTI's helpful submission this morning of the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch evidence on pregnancy, antenatal and maternity care. We are very grateful that this was one of the issues that was picked out to be summarised this morning. It very much reflects the evidence provided by the PBPOs in our submissions so far.

Second, in relation to Mind, we are pleased to see that Mind have been given CP status in Module 3. A significant number of pregnant women and birthing people, as well as those who experienced bereavements, experienced mental health issues during the pandemic. We strongly support Mind's submission that a Rule 9 request should be provided to them, and also that an expert on mental health issues should be instructed. And of course we hear the Inquiry's points that they made a number of times that decisions have to be made and dividing lines, as difficult as they are, have to be drawn, but we do say that mental health is a hugely important issue for our groups and therefore we support more focus being placed upon it.

Thirdly, we agree with the submissions of John's Campaign and the other groups represented by that core participant at paragraphs 4 to 9 of their written submissions that healthcare in locations other than hospitals and GP surgeries should not be forgotten.

Many women and birthing people prefer their maternity care to take place as much as possible outside of a hospital, especially during Covid but also at other times, and they may choose a freestanding midwife-led unit or home birth for the healthcare they're receiving.

We've already highlighted in our submissions before this that the fact -- the suspension of these services, which was designed to compel healthy women to go into hospitals for their care, drove some to choosing wholly unassisted births and others into reluctantly spending time in a location with a high risk of infection. So we therefore support John's Campaign's submission, and I will also make that point in a different context in relation to CVF later.

Fourth, we support the submission which has been made by a number of CPs across modules that it's important for the Inquiry to set out in detail how it intends to build the information gained from Every Story Matters into each relevant module.

Those are my submissions for the PBPOs.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Wagner. And if you were struggling over the acronym, you've only got yourself to blame.

**Mr Wagner**: We did work through a number and, if you'll believe it, that was the best.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much. We'll break now and I'll come back -- given how many we have to go, I think is 1.50 pm all right? I'm looking at my wonderful stenographer. 1.50 pm, please.

*(12.58 pm)*

*(The short adjournment)*

*(1.50 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Wagner.

**Mr Wagner**: Thank you, and good afternoon. I now make submissions on behalf of the Clinically Vulnerable Families, CVF, which is easy to say.

First, safety at the hearings, my regular update on this issue, which you will be pleased to hear will be short. We want to express our thanks to the Inquiry team, who have been highly responsive to our requests, and we can report that to date they have been following both the letter and the spirit of the Equality Act, in our opinion, and we are very grateful for that, and we appreciate how much time and resource this has taken, but we know that you, Chair, and your team understand how important it is that the Covid-19 Inquiry, of all inquiries, gets this right, and it is an ongoing discussion.

We know that at least one person who was in the room for the Module 4 hearing two weeks ago likely had Covid during the hearing, and my lay clients who sit beside me, and who are clinically vulnerable, were concerned to hear this, but also not at all surprised; given the current Covid rates, it would be statistically expected that there would at least be one person in the room with Covid.

My lay clients, who are clinically vulnerable, say it's hugely important that they and the people that they represent are able safely to attend these hearings, not as separate but equal, having to observe the hearings online in a different space, but as full and equal participants.

There is a wider point here. Air quality and ventilation are hugely important issues for the clinically vulnerable people across the country. Currently 1.8 million of them, according to the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. If ventilation in buildings such as schools and hospitals was better, viruses such as Covid would not spread so easily. And if we don't address this, we will be facing more absences, more disease, and potentially even more restrictions going forward. For that reason, on both the narrow point about safety here and the wider point about safety in the country, we will continue to work with the Inquiry on this important issue.

My second submission is about the division of the respective scopes of Module 3 and Module 4 as it relates to therapeutics. Now, I did hear the point that Ms Carey KC made in relation to the scope, saying that the scope of Module 4 is for the Module 4 team, and in that respect you have my detailed written submissions on the points, and given that indication I won't press them in any detail, but I do make one point which I say is important for Module 3.

The Inquiry's current plan, as we understand it, is to divide consideration of therapeutics across Modules 4 and 3, in that sequence. And you ruled, Chair, after the Module 4 preliminary hearing that the scope of Module 4 will be amended to the development, trials and steps taken to enable the use of new therapeutics and repurposed medications during the pandemic.

Module 3, as we understand it, will consider the use of therapeutics, which will not be considered in Module 4. However, our concern is that the provisional scope for Module 3 makes no reference to therapeutics, despite being a very detailed document. It does mention treatment for patients with Covid-19 in general in paragraph 5, and the provisional list of issues is the same. This highlights a problem, we say, that Module 3 will not consider properly and fully the use of therapeutics.

CTI this morning mentioned that intensivists have been asked for evidence on therapeutics, which is entirely understandable because the use of therapeutics in hospitals to treat patient with severe Covid-19 or Covid-19 generally is obviously important in this module. But some of the key therapeutics, in fact many of the key therapeutics, are accessed only in the community. The process is structurally similar to vaccination rather than being similar to other kinds of treatment, such as being put on a ventilator, that's received in hospitals.

We therefore ask the Module 3 team to consider this question: will the use of therapeutics in the community be considered in Module 3? Because it's not in the scope and it's not in the issues list, and it wouldn't obviously come under the treatment of Covid-19 when considered in relation to a Rule 9 statement to a doctor. Treatment of Covid-19 would not necessarily encompass treatment in the community, but that's where most therapeutics are accessed.

So if the answer is no to that question, there needs to be some clarification in the respective scopes of Modules 3 and 4, because the risk is that that point, which really gets to the heart of the provision of therapeutics, will fall between the cracks and will not be considered by either.

So that's the single point that I make in relation to that issue.

My second submission is on the provisional list of issues. The first thing to say is CVF strongly welcomes paragraph 11 and considers the Inquiry has correctly identified the key issues affecting shielding and the impact on the clinically vulnerable in that paragraph. We are grateful for that.

As to provisional paragraph 6, CVF note the change to paragraph 6(b) to explicitly include the reference to blanket decision-making on DNACPRs, Do Not Attempt Resuscitation orders or notices, which the Inquiry will appreciate is a particular concern of our members.

CVF still consider that the decision about healthcare should include a specific review of the Covid-19 decision support tool. It's an extremely important issue for the clinically vulnerable.

This was a tool that was developed during the pandemic to assist decision-making in people with underlying conditions who were infected with Covid-19. CVF respectfully suggests that the Inquiry should investigate how widely it was accepted and used in healthcare, even if not formally used, the psychological effect of this tool being publicised nationally, including in the media, and to both healthcare professionals and clinically vulnerable people, and we proposed a new subparagraph or extra words:

"The use and potential effects of decision support tools to determine patients' pre-morbid states and their treatment options for Covid-19."

The third submission I make is about the inclusion of the clinically vulnerable and clinically extremely vulnerable as an equality group. The Inquiry's terms of reference include an obligation to consider any disparities evident in the impact of the pandemic on different categories of people, including but not limited to those relating to the protected characteristics under the Equality Act and equality categories under the Northern Ireland Act 1998.

Evidently the scope of the categories identified is within the Inquiry's discretion, and certainly -- obviously doesn't end with the protected characteristics in the Equality Act.

As you know, Chair, the Inquiry produced an equalities and human rights statement in July which currently mentions groups with protected characteristics within the meaning of the Equality Act, geographical differences, social economic background, occupation and immigration status. Those are all extremely important groups.

We are disappointed, however, to see that the clinically vulnerable, who were and remain particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, are not identified as a relevant group or characteristic. The clinically vulnerable, as a definition, as a category, was in effect invented by Covid, or at least it's a reaction to Covid, because it's the people who are most at risk of Covid. As a category, there are lots of people who would have considered themselves clinically vulnerable before Covid. However, Covid brought in a wide range of different conditions.

Covid itself and the associated decision-making, including in healthcare, had a very specific impact on the clinically vulnerable, the people that we represent, and at present, regrettably, they feel they have been practically been forgotten. CVF is keen to ensure that this oversight is not repeated by the Inquiry.

We therefore submit and request that the Inquiry consider adding to the equalities and human rights statement "clinical vulnerability to Covid-19" as an extra bullet point, which would allow the clinically vulnerable as a category -- to pick up, I think it was, Mr Metzer KC's terminology this morning -- to be a thread which runs through the Inquiry.

This is particularly important to CVF because we will not be there during Module 2, not having been designated a core participant, and it's extremely important that somewhere along the line the Inquiry embed consideration of the clinically vulnerable, because we are concerned that otherwise they may be lost or subsumed into people with disabilities. Now, of course, not every clinically vulnerable person has a disability under the Equality Act, and not every person who has a disability is clinically vulnerable. They are cross-cutting but not the same categories.

So we would ask that the Inquiry consider adding the clinically vulnerable to the equalities and human rights statement.

Finally, I'll make some brief points on the other core participants' submissions.

First, we are deeply concerned, and this relates to CTI's oral submissions, that the Department for Health and Social Care has failed to provide any Rule 9 statements six months after they were requested, and we certainly endorse your statement earlier, Chair, that if that issue continues to be an issue, you will consider using the powers available to you, because ultimately those statements have to be provided in good time.

Secondly, we support and are pleased to see Mind has CP status in Module 3. We support their submission that the Inquiry should hear from them by way of Rule 9 and that the Inquiry should commission an expert in mental health. Mental health was a hugely important issue for many clinically vulnerable and particularly -- well, not particularly but including those who had to shield for very long periods of time. In fact, some are shielding to this day. And we certainly support Mind's submission that the Inquiry find a way of increasing its focus on mental health.

On the expert panel for IPC, we're grateful that the identities of the experts have now been revealed in CTI's oral submissions, and we intend to make some submissions on the identities of those experts in due course.

Fourth, we heard, and took note, of the discussions around the length of the ten-week hearing, and do not attempt to propose an additional amount of time that is needed, because we haven't seen the witness list and we don't know what the Inquiry's plans are in any specificity. However, just to go back to that point about therapeutics, we are concerned that in the tight hearing -- on anyone's view it's going to be tight to fit this module into ten weeks -- we are concerned that if the use of therapeutics in its full extent is included in Module 3, that will take some time, and that should be considered.

Then finally we support the inclusion of carers, including unpaid carers, into the issues list, and that's from paragraph 11 of John's Campaign's written submissions.

We thank you, Chair, and especially your team for your continuing work and engagement with CVF. Those are my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Wagner. A couple of points. On the use of therapeutics, I've obviously been considering carefully what you and others have said and the overlap with Modules 3 and 4, and I will discuss that further with both teams to see what we can do to ensure that everyone's concerns are met.

In relation to participation in the hearing, obviously we'll continue to try to ensure that everybody who wishes to attend a hearing in person can do so safely, and as you've already acknowledged the team have been working hard with those whom you represent to ensure that's possible. But I just want to say, I don't -- these are hybrid proceedings and I don't consider participation remotely to be in any way second class, just in case any of those following online thought there was something second class about that participation. As you know, many people make their submissions online, and these are intended to be, throughout, hybrid proceedings. I just wanted to make that clear, that nothing derogatory is intended if someone appears online.

**Mr Wagner**: No, and I didn't intend to imply that either. I suppose the point is that while there is an option to attend either in person or online, if reasonably possible, my lay clients would prefer to have both options available to them, and they will use both options and have been using both options in different contexts. So it's really more about ensuring access to both options than privileging one or the other.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much. Understood.

**Mr Wagner**: I'm grateful.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Wagner.

Mr Straw, I think you're over there.
