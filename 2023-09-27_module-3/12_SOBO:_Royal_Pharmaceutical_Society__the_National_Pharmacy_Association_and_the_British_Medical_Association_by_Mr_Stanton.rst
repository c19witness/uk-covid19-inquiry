12. Submissions on Behalf of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the National Pharmacy Association and the British Medical Association by Mr Stanton
==================================================================================================================================================

**Mr Stanton**: Thank you, my Lady.

My Lady, I have three submissions to make on behalf of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the National Pharmacy Association, and the British Medical Association. In total, the submissions should take approximately 20 minutes.

As the Royal Pharmaceutical Society has not yet previously addressed you, I propose to take them first.

The RPS is the professional body for pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists in Great Britain. It leads and supports the development of the pharmacy profession, including through postgraduate pharmacy education curricula, professional standards and guidance. Its policy and advocacy work is guided by three elected boards across England, Scotland and Wales. Its members work across all care settings in the health service, including in community pharmacy, hospitals and primary care, as well as in wider roles such as the armed forces, prisons, the pharmaceutical industry and academia.

It offers free membership to students studying for a pharmacy undergraduate degree, working together with the British Pharmaceutical Students' Association, the official student body of the RPS.

Its knowledge business, Pharmaceutical Press, also produces a range of independent pharmaceutical information sources used around the world.

Covid-19 highlighted the essential work of pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, pharmacy technicians and wider pharmacy teams in supporting the nation's health by ensuring safe access to medicines and through healthcare research and development.

The pandemic brought unparalleled challenges that stretched personal and professional resilience to the limit. Pharmacists faced a huge surge in demand from patients at the same time as coping with a unique and changing work environment as national policy and guidance evolved. The RPS worked together with the profession to respond to these unprecedented challenges drawing on insights and intelligence from frontline pharmacists, stakeholders, elected members and a wide range of expert advisory groups.

Pharmacists and wider pharmacy teams were on the frontline of Covid-19, working alongside colleagues across the health service, often putting themselves at risk so they could continue looking after patients in a time of national crisis, and tragically there are pharmacists and pharmacy team members who died after acquiring the Covid-19 infection, some of whom had given decades of service to their communities.

Community pharmacy remained open throughout the pandemic to provide vital care for their communities. Primary care pharmacists changed their ways of working to ensure that patients could continue to access medicines and care, including through video consultations, and academic teams also continued to support students remotely.

Hospital pharmacists cared for the most critically ill patients with Covid-19, transforming services to support colleagues, and made great efforts to source medicines for critical care to ensure supply.

There were also huge challenges for those who supported people living in care homes.

Given this crucial role and the efforts and sacrifices made, it has been hugely disappointing and distressing that the pharmacy profession, and particularly community pharmacy, was often an afterthought in government planning, policy and communications. The difference in treatment between pharmacists who provide NHS contracted services compared with healthcare workers directly employed by the NHS has been a recurring and systemic issue, and the RPS and others in the profession have repeatedly called for pharmacists to be recognised for the frontline healthcare role they perform.

One of the worst examples of these double standards was the omission of pharmacists from the life assurance scheme announced on 27 April 2020 by the Department of Health and Social Care for the families of frontline health and care workers in England.

The whole pharmacy profession was shocked and dismayed to learn that community pharmacists would only be considered for the scheme in England in exceptional circumstances. It remains unclear how and why this approach was taken by government, and although the decision was quickly reversed following representations by the RPS, NPA and others, it is sadly a decision that has left a bitter taste within the profession.

Other examples of this difference in treatment include the following: the lack of explicit mention of pharmacists in the initial list of key workers, which caused problems for pharmacists around childcare provision, access to supermarkets, and freedom of movement, particularly getting to their place of work. Pharmacists were initially excluded from a national PPE ordering portal, despite frontline pharmacy teams warning that they were unable to maintain safe social distancing either from colleagues or patients and were struggling to source PPE to protect themselves, their patients and their families.

In March 2020 the Home Office announced that doctors, nurses and paramedics would have their visas extended free of charge for one year as part of the national effort to combat Covid-19. However, this was not initially the case for pharmacists and pre-registration pharmacists, and it required action again by the RPS, British Pharmaceutical Students' Association and others before government changed course.

Regarding the health and wellbeing of pharmacists, the enormous strain that the pandemic placed on staff has showed the importance of wellbeing services, and the RPS has long campaigned for pharmacists to have equal access to these services.

At the start of the pandemic, access to wellbeing services was not universal across the UK, particularly within pharmacy, as the profession works across many different care settings. However, they should all have equal access to wellbeing support, including for long Covid, regardless of where they work.

Evidence has also emerged of the serious impact of the pandemic on ethnic minority communities. Results from a survey from the RPS and the UK Black Pharmacist Association in June 2020 found that more than two-thirds of pharmacists and pre-registration pharmacists from ethnic minorities across primary and secondary care had not received Covid-19 risk assessments nearly two months after the NHS said they should take place.

The pandemic also exposed the fragility of the medicine supply chain, leading to shortages of many commonly used medicines. But this also led to the empowerment of pharmacists through regulations that supported professional decision-making and allowed pharmacists to take appropriate steps to minimise the impact of medicine shortages on patient care. This increased ability to exercise professional judgement should become more commonplace in the view of the RPS.

Regarding communication and stakeholder engagement by government, the RPS found that headline policies would often be announced centrally before the details had been finalised, which left pharmacists and others across the health service looking for clarity in what it meant for them.

Closer co-ordination and engagement with professional bodies at an earlier stage will enable them to keep their members better informed and reassured, to develop appropriate support, resources and professional guidance, and provide constructive challenge to encourage more effective approximately making.

There were some examples over the pandemic of a more open and collaborative approach from government, however more needs to be done in this area. Community pharmacy teams played a pivotal role in protecting the health of the public over the pandemic, however they're currently under very significant pressure, which is leading to the closure of pharmacies in local communities.

Lessons learned from the pandemic and improvement required include making the most of pharmacists' clinical skills, supporting public health and prevention, reducing hospital admissions and ensuring timely information flow and access to records to better manage demand and build resilience across the health service. This must be backed by workforce planning, sustainable funding, and appropriate investment in pharmacy-led services, education and treatment.

The RPS hopes that the Inquiry will be able to take account of the vital contribution and dedication of pharmacists and pharmacy teams across the whole of the health service and of the impact of Covid-19 on the pharmacy profession and patients, and that the work of the Inquiry will bring about the much needed changes to prepare for the future.

My Lady, turning to the National Pharmacy Association, you will recall that the NPA addressed you in the first Module 3 preliminary hearing earlier this year, and again in Module 4 a couple of weeks ago, and in these circumstances I don't propose to repeat the nature and scope of its work, save to say that it has similar aims and objectives to the RPS, with the main differences being the RPS membership is comprised of individual students, trainees, and registered pharmacists, whereas the NPA represents community pharmacy businesses, typically family-owned community-focused businesses.

In respect of their geographical reach, RPS membership is available in England, Wales and Scotland, while the NPA is a UK-wide organisation, including pharmacy businesses in Northern Ireland, which of course experienced their own unique challenges because of the Northern Ireland Protocol, including additional difficulties in the sourcing and supply of medicines.

These submissions on behalf of the NPA are focused on the Inquiry's provisional list of issues and the NPA welcomes the inclusion within issue 4 of the changing role of community pharmacy within primary care. The NPA would also like to propose two additional areas for inclusion, both of which are supported by the RPS.

The first of these areas arises out of the different way in which community pharmacy was treated by government from other frontline healthcare workers, often by omission or afterthought. The deliberate omission of pharmacists from the life assurance scheme for healthcare workers is something that shocked and disappointed the whole profession, as already referenced in the RPS submission. To appreciate the full impact of this decision, it's worth setting out the circumstances in a little detail.

On 27 April 2020 the Department of Health and Social Care announced that the families of frontline health and care workers in England would benefit from a new life assurance scheme during the pandemic. The announcement stated that:

"The scheme is aimed at those who die from coronavirus during the course of their essential and lifesaving work. This includes those providing direct care as well as cleaners and porters who continue to carry out vital duties in these care environments."

The then Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, also said:

"Nothing can make up for the tragic loss of a loved one during this pandemic. We owe a huge debt to those who die in service to our nation and are doing everything we can to protect them.

"Financial worries should be the last thing on the minds of their families so in recognition of these unprecedented circumstances we are expanding financial protection to NHS and social care workers delivering publicly funded care on the frontline.

"We will continue to strive night and day to provide them with the support and protection they need and deserve to keep them safe as they work tirelessly to save lives."

However, despite being part of NHS primary care, risking their lives to treat patients and dealing with a huge surge in demand and increase in working hours, community pharmacy staff were initially excluded from this scheme and they were told they would only be considered in exceptional circumstances.

The NPA and RPS were quick to respond, and the letter of the NPA to Matt Hancock on 29 April 2020 stated:

"Community pharmacists and their staff are risking their lives every day to serve on the frontline alongside their colleagues across the NHS and social care, therefore it is only right and fair that they should also be entitled to the same death in service benefits."

A swift U-turn by UK Government followed which sought to explain the initial exclusion in a less than convincing fashion, on the grounds that community pharmacy had a different nature of employment from the rest of the NHS. However, the damage to morale was already done, and this divisive decision still rankles within the pharmacy profession.

Other examples of exclusion and/or different treatment include: not being recognised as key workers, the adverse consequences of which have been already been described in the RPS submission; not being given access to the NHS PPE portal in England, to enable PPE to be ordered and supplied, until September 2020, six months into the pandemic; and the lack of availability of testing for community pharmacy staff until November 2020 because community pharmacy was inaccurately categorised as a retail setting rather than a healthcare establishment, which had a very significant adverse impact on the resourcing of community pharmacies as a result of the unnecessary need for staff to self-isolate in circumstances where they were not in fact infected.

The NPA requests that you consider reflecting these issues within the provisional list of issues in the following ways:

First, in respect of the way healthcare workers are referenced within the list of issues. For example, issue 1, the impact of Covid on people's experience of healthcare refers to healthcare staff including doctors, nurses, paramedics, midwives, medical trainee and clinical support staff, but makes no mention of pharmacists. Similarly, issue 7, which again concerns the impact of the pandemic, refers to the impact on doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff. It is appreciated that these references are expressed inclusively, however to avoid any doubt and to take account of the concerns of community pharmacy about exclusion as just described, one option may be to include a comprehensive list of healthcare workers within a footnoted definition of "healthcare staff" or "healthcare worker".

The second aspect is to consider including within issue 2 core decision-making and leadership, the failures by government to adequately and fairly consider the interests and circumstances of all healthcare workers who contributed to the pandemic response.

The second general area for inclusion within the list of issues is the contribution made by community pharmacy and other primary care providers during the pandemic to the health and social capital of the communities they serve, thereby reducing health inequalities.

Healthcare services are disproportionately located outside areas of greatest need. However, community pharmacy bucks this trend and the concentration of community pharmacies is higher in deprived areas, which enables pharmacy-based services to play a role in addressing health inequalities between affluent and less well-off areas.

Community pharmacies also have unique insights into the challenges facing vulnerable patients because these patients are disproportionately located within deprived communities.

Specific actions taken by the NPA around equalities issues during the pandemic include making the case to the Department of Health and Social Care and to NHS England in March 2020 for the delivery of medicines to vulnerable patients who were shielding. This subsequently led to community pharmacies delivering a significant scheme to support shielding patients through home delivery of their medicines, which required the employment and training of additional staff during the already extremely challenging circumstances of the pandemic.

The NPA also worked closely with the Home Office on the introduction of the "Ask for ANI" scheme, which gave victims of domestic abuse a way to seek help through their local pharmacy when other services were unavailable, which was voluntary and included providing access to private consultation rooms and undertaking additional training, again on top of already difficult and challenging working conditions.

It collaborated with charities and NHS England to provide Covid-19 vaccines to those with insecure NHS status and those without a fixed address.

Through actions such as these, the role of community pharmacy as a hub of the community was enhanced during the pandemic, when other social contact was curtailed or unavailable, and the NPA suggests that within issue 5, healthcare provision and treatment, which already includes consideration of inequalities in access to hospital and critical care, a further sub-issue could be added that will allow for the consideration of ways in which healthcare providers sought to reduce inequalities in healthcare provision so that account can be taken of these positive contributions as well as of the barriers and obstacles.

My Lady, finally the British Medical Association.

**Lady Hallett**: You're getting close to your allotted time, Mr Stanton.

**Mr Stanton**: My Lady, I have two issues to address you on. The first relates to risk assessments. I'll aim to cut out some of the content.

In respect of risk assessments, my Lady, you're aware that all employers are subject to a legal duty to undertake suitable and sufficient risk assessments that are proportionate to the nature of the risk, and this includes a requirement to address the protection of groups of individuals who are susceptible to an either risk to health because of factors such as gender, age, comorbidity and ethnicity.

However, despite this legal obligation, the provision of risk assessments for healthcare workers was woefully inadequate over the period of the pandemic. Healthcare workers, including those more susceptible to serious illness from Covid-19, for example due to factors such as age, ethnicity, sex or underlying health conditions, did not receive timely and adequate workplace risk assessments which could, if undertaken and acted upon, have prevented the death and long-term illness of some workers.

This legal obligation to undertake risk assessment rests with employers. However, in the BMA's view, it is important to also investigate the role of key government departments and agencies, including the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and the Health and Safety Executive, to consider whether they should have done more to support employing organisations to both understand and fulfil their obligations in the context of Covid-19.

The BMA's position in this regard, my Lady, is that the absence of timely and adequate risk assessments in response to a new and deadly disease to which healthcare workers were directly exposed, often without adequate protection, requires specific consideration as part of the work of the Inquiry in understanding the impact of the pandemic on the physical and mental health and wellbeing of doctors and other healthcare workers, and the BMA asks that you give careful consideration to its express inclusion within issue 7.

My Lady, the final point I'd like to make is in respect of the stockpile of respiratory protective equipment.

Regarding the failure to adequately stockpile respiratory protective equipment, RPE, the BMA welcomes the Inquiry's intention to examine the availability and adequacy of protective equipment within issue 8, and is pleased to note the clear distinction drawn within the provisional list of issues between personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment.

The BMA also welcomes the indication that the list of issues will continue to develop as the Inquiry's evidence base grows, and in line with this approach we raise now for consideration of express inclusion in the next version of the list of issues the important question of why the stockpile of RPE was so lacking prior to the pandemic.

My Lady, we recognise that this is an issue of preparedness. However, there was not sufficient time within Module 1 to address it, and you may recall within the BMA's closing statement to Module 1 we referred to the need to give further consideration.

Expressly included already within issue 8, at 8B3, is whether the standard of RPE and PPE provided to healthcare workers followed the scientific understanding as the pandemic progressed. However, we ask you to extend this issue to include the scientific understanding of :outline:`aerosol` transmission of viruses prior to the pandemic.

This is because it's the BMA's position that the stockpile of RPE and the supplies that healthcare workers relied upon were not properly constituted in accordance with scientific understanding from at least 2008. That is, we started off from a point that was not in accordance with the scientific understanding about how healthcare workers should be protected from :outline:`aerosol` transmission.

We set this position out more fully within the BMA's written submissions to Module 1, but, very briefly, in 2008 the Health and Safety Laboratory produced a report for the Health and Safety Executive that evaluated the relative levels of protection afforded by :outline:`surgical masks` and :outline:`respirators` against an :outline:`airborne` virus, and concluded that :outline:`surgical masks` should not be used in situations where close exposure to infectious :outline:`aerosols` is likely.

Best practice was stated to be the use of :outline:`FFP3` devices. The report concluded with the prescient warning that the widespread use of :outline:`respirators` might be difficult to sustain during a pandemic unless provision is made for their use in advance.

Between 2008 and the outbreak of the pandemic there was scientific consideration of this issue, including within NERVTAG, however stockpile levels of :outline:`FFP3 respirators` remained at a level that was wholly inadequate for the purposes of protecting healthcare staff against an :outline:`airborne` virus. And worse, there is evidence before the Inquiry that suggests that this was because issues of costs were prioritised over safety.

These are issues of significant importance to healthcare workers who want to know why they were so badly let down and to have assurances that it will not happen again. They are also intrinsically linked to IPC issues.

In the BMA's view, in order to make a full assessment of the protections provided to healthcare workers, it is necessary to consider the interconnecting issues of infection prevention and control and the provision of equipment -- of protective equipment, I beg your pardon, both prior to and during the pandemic, and we suggest that this can easily be achieved by expanding issues 8A and 8B accordingly.

Finally, my Lady, the BMA has recently provided a lengthy draft witness statement which raises a large number of issues for consideration in Module 3. We appreciate that your team will need time to consider them and we look forward to working together in the coming months to develop the list of issues further.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Stanton. We'll break now. I shall return at 3.30.

*(3.15 pm)*

*(A short break)*

*(3.30 pm)*

**Lady Hallett**: Right, Mr Dayle, I think. I've got "on the far right" written down. Yes.
