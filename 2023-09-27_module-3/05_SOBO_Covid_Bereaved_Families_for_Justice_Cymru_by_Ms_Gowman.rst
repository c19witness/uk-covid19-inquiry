5. Submissions on Behalf of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru by Ms Gowman
===================================================================================

**Ms Gowman**: Yes, I have, your Ladyship. Prynhawn da, good

afternoon. I represent Covid-19 Bereaved Families for

Justice Cymru, and will refer to the group as the Cymru

group.

A significant proportion of the group's members died

as a result of hospital-acquired Covid. Accordingly,

the group believes that it has a real standing on the

issue of the impact of Covid-19 on healthcare systems in

Wales.

Your Ladyship has received written submissions from the group and I don't propose to repeat the same in detail. These oral submissions will therefore seek to supplement the Cymru group's written position in respect of the following topics: the provisional list of issues, Rule 9 requests, expert evidence, disclosure, and Every Story Matters.

Dealing firstly with the provisional list of issues. Your Ladyship will have read from the written submission the key areas of concern for the Cymru group. Overall, the group considers that the provisional list is sufficiently broad to encompass its areas of concern. However, there are several lines of enquiry that the group would invite the Inquiry to confirm will be explored in detail within Module 3. I will focus on elaborating upon six particular lines of enquiry.

First, the Cymru group agrees with the joint submission of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice and the Northern Ireland group that, given that preparedness of the health system fell outside of the scope of Module 1, that number 1 on the list of issues in Module 3 should be preparedness. In particular this should include pandemic preparedness at NHS trust health board level in Wales, including the readiness of the infrastructure, provisions, management and frontline staff.

Secondly, in respect of decision-making and leadership, the Cymru group is focused on how matters were dealt with in Wales. The group seeks confirmation that the Inquiry will explore what information was or should have been available to decision-makers at the time decisions were made. And this in particular should include an exploration of whether Welsh bodies paid sufficient regard to the fact that Covid-19 was airborne and, if not, why not.

In this regard, the Cymru group supports the points raised in the written submission of COVID-19 Airborne Transmission Alliance.

Third, the Inquiry will be aware that many of the Cymru group lost loved ones due to hospital-acquired Covid, in the context of perceived inadequate infection control and a lack of adequate PPE in Welsh hospitals, many of which were known to have inadequate ventilation.

In relation to the issue of preventing the spread of Covid-19 in healthcare settings, the Cymru group submits that the Inquiry should also clarify and confirm that the matter of segregation will be explored as part of the exploration of inspection control measures in hospitals. This is a matter of deep concern for the Cymru group, particularly given that many lost loved ones because they contracted Covid in hospitals, having been placed on wards with other Covid patients.

Fourthly, the Cymru group is keen to champion the rights of the elderly in Wales, and welcomes the Inquiry's proposed examination of Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation notices. To add to the written submission, many of the group's loved ones were placed on DNACPRs as soon as they tested positive for Covid, without due process we say.

From the group's experience, often neither the patient nor the family were consulted about their decisions. Many members, some of whom held power of attorney or deputyship for health and welfare for their loved ones, only discovered that they were placed on DNACPR notices after they had requested copies of their medical records post death. Upon review, often forms were completely incomplete or inaccurate, and the group urges the Inquiry to robustly examine whether those forms were completed in accordance with due process.

Fifth, many in the Cymru group report that after they had lost loved ones they found that morgues simply did not have the capacity to deal with the excess deaths arising from Covid. At least four members of the group experienced the bodies of loved ones going missing in morgues, which understandably made after-death and funeral arrangements, together with the grieving process, even more distressing. As such, the Cymru group urges the Inquiry to add more capacity to its lines of enquiry for Module 3.

The Cymru group also invites the Inquiry at this stage to consider the lack of bereavement support offered by Welsh health boards as a line of inquiry. It's understood that none of the Cymru group's bereaved members were made aware of any Welsh health board that had bereavement support during the first 18 months of the pandemic.

The final point in respect of the provisional list of issues is this: the Cymru group is aware from the preliminary hearing on Module 4 on 13 September that it's envisaged that this module will review healthcare systems' response to clinical trials and research during the pandemic, together with the use of therapeutics in practice once effective treatments had been identified and approved, and that I'm grateful has been reiterated today.

The Cymru group considers that at the very least the proposed approach demands a close interplay between Modules 3 and 4 and the Cymru group implores close collaboration in this regard to ensure that nothing falls between the gaps.

It goes without saying perhaps that the Cymru group is also particularly keen to understand what therapeutics were available and used to treat Covid patients in Wales specifically and how their efficacy was recorded and disseminated.

At this juncture I make an observation on the timetable. The Cymru group also invites the Inquiry to reflect upon the viability of covering all of these issues in the envisaged ten weeks. The list of issues is vast and covers important matters which vary amongst the devolved administrations, and the Cymru group agrees with the other bereaved groups that it appears necessary and proportionate to provisionally allow, at the very least, some further time for the hearing in order to ensure that the issues are explored without avoidable limitations.

Within the context of the list of issues, I now turn to Rule 9s. The Cymru group submits that in order to properly examine the Module 3 issues in Wales, Rule 9 statements must be received from relevant individuals and organisations operating in Wales.

The group seeks confirmation, for the avoidance of doubt, that requests have or will be sent to organisations and institutions whose members work within the healthcare sector in Wales, the Welsh divisions of the Royal Colleges, and charities, groups and non-governmental organisations operating in Wales.

Within its written submission, the Cymru group has suggested 24 individuals and/or organisations that the Inquiry should seek to obtain Rule 9 statements from. The list includes NHS Wales, the seven local health boards and the three NHS trusts which operate in Wales, together with relevant regulators, and the group is grateful for the indication given today that these suggestions will be considered by the Inquiry team as it embarks on the next phase.

The Cymru group further agrees with the submissions advanced by the Trades Union Congress that evidence from frontline staff in Wales will be crucial to understanding how policies, procedures and guidance were implemented in practice, their effectiveness and what lessons can be learnt moving forward.

Finally, the Cymru group supports the Inquiry's indicated robust approach to ensuring that deadlines for Rule 9 statements are maintained to avoid delay, and reiterate its request for statements to be released to core participants as soon as possible thereafter.

I move on to the instruction of expert witnesses. In a similar vein to the submissions made in respect of Rule 9 requests, the Cymru group submits that in order to properly examine the Module 3 issues in Wales, experts instructed must have sufficient expertise and experience of practice in Wales to be able to provide evidence dealing with Wales specifically.

Further, experts must search for, document and analyse the Welsh data and scrutinise the position in Wales. Unfortunately it has not always been the case that expert reports provided to the Inquiry to date have demonstrated sufficient Welsh expertise or analysed sufficient Welsh data. More generally, the Cymru group is grateful for the Inquiry's assurance that all experts instructed to date are considered sufficiently independent to provide an objective view and is grateful for the Inquiry's clarification that the expert reports will set out any potential or perceived conflict in order that the Inquiry team may take a further view in respect of whether further expert evidence is warranted.

Next I will deal with the issue of disclosure. The Cymru group is deeply concerned about the issue of retention of emails within --

**Lady Hallett**: I appreciate you're trying to get through in the time, but just looking at ...

**Ms Gowman**: Ah, slow down? Yes, certainly.

The retention of emails within NHS Wales Microsoft 365 email service, which has resulted in all content from mailboxes of inactive users being deleted. The group is particularly concerned that the deletions will impact on the ability of relevant individuals and organisations to respond to Rule 9 requests, on the Inquiry team's ability to further develop the list of issues for consideration, and on the Inquiry team and core participants' ability to put relevant matters to witnesses in evidence.

The position the Inquiry finds itself in, in my submission, is unacceptable, and Digital Healthcare Wales must be held to account. The explanation provided by them to date is, in the Cymru group's view, inadequate and underplays the scale and potential impact of this issue. The Cymru group considers that this is a very real problem, as highlighted by the written submission made by the group of Welsh NHS bodies, which suggests that this may be an issue which is widespread across its constituent members and is likely to present, at the very least, practical difficulties in responding to Rule 9 requests.

It is of concern to the Cymru group that the NHS bodies themselves have not sought to work with the Inquiry to raise the potential of delay, notwithstanding the submission made by the group of Welsh NHS bodies.

The group is particularly concerned that any mitigating steps to obtain the deleted emails will be time consuming and will not ensure in any event the recovery of all information lost, and for those reasons the Cymru group supports the Inquiry in its continued robust approach to exploration of this matter.

Aside from the deletion issue, on the issue of disclosure, the Cymru group agrees with the submission made on behalf of the Royal College of Nursing that the Inquiry should endeavour to compose a complete suite of infection prevention and control guidance, by seeking from relevant bodies a full suite of the iterations of the guidance and a clear chronology as to when, by whom, and how the guidance was varied and disseminated. And the group makes the simple point that this should of course include IPC guidance applicable to Wales.

Turning finally to Every Story Matters and participation of the bereaved in Module 3, which are very important issues for those whom I represent. Within its written submission, the Cymru group has suggested additions to the key lines of enquiry for Every Story Matters, and the group hopes that your Ladyship will find this of assistance. The Cymru group endorses the submissions made on behalf of the other bereaved groups that bereaved families have and will continue to provide powerful and valuable information in respect of their experiences. The Cymru group further agrees that the process in itself will be cathartic not only for the bereaved families but also for society as a whole in its efforts to come to terms with the shared sense of grief.

To this end the Cymru group also asks that members of the group be given the opportunity to give evidence in the Inquiry, particularly where their evidence can also speak to systemic issues.

Some of the issues that the Cymru group members can provide valuable evidence on are healthcare decision-making and resources, testing, segregation in hospitals and end of life care.

In closing, the Cymru group experienced first-hand the consequences of the catastrophic impact of the pandemic on healthcare provision in Wales. Its members experienced and continue to experience suffering and trauma due to the devastation of Covid-19 in this regard. The group will continue to work proactively with the Inquiry to robustly explore key decisions made and to understand what went wrong and why, so that lessons can be learned in Wales to minimise the potential for further suffering.

Diolch am wrando. Those are my submissions, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, very helpful, Ms Gowman.

Mr Metzer, I think you're attending remotely.
