2. Submissions on Behalf of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Ms Munroe KC
===================================================================================

**Ms Munroe**: Yes.

Good morning, my Lady. As you know, I represent Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, instructed by Broudie Jackson Canter solicitors, and today I'm gratefully and ably assisted by counsel, Mr Oliver Lewis and solicitor Ms Clare Fletcher.

My Lady, I'm grateful to you and your team for taking the time to read and digest our detailed submissions. I'm mindful of the number of CPs that wish to make oral submissions to you, so I intend simply to, I hope, augment the written submissions we have provided, with an emphasis on certain points and matters which are of particular importance to our families, and which we hope to persuade the Inquiry to consider further and, where necessary, to adopt.

Where I do not mention orally matters that are in our written submissions, we still of course consider those to be important.

My Lady, I essentially have five short topics to comment on: one, effective participation of our families; second, health inequalities and discrimination; thirdly, sequencing and timetable; fourth, experts; and finally, Rule 9 and disclosure.

Effective participation. My Lady, you will find at paragraphs 10 to 13 of our written document our detailed submissions in this regard, but you will of course recall from Module 1 the impact of hearing from the families. It changed the dynamics in the room. It was visceral, it was real, but it was very, very powerful. It showed the value of hearing from those and their lived experiences of losing loved ones, and the aftermath and the ongoing impact on their lives of the pandemic.

Hearing their voices will be particularly relevant, we say, in Module 3. We say that, my Lady, not from a maudlin sense of wanting to hear more suffering and personal tragedies, but in a very real sense because they will add value to this module.

We within our group are fortunate that we have a wide and diverse group of individuals. We have a number of people who are healthcare professionals, doctors, nurses, paramedics, ambulance workers, those who have held managerial positions within the healthcare organisations, worked in care homes, those who have managed trusts. They have and they are able to see things from a dual perspective, both as bereaved family members who have lost children, partners, parents, loved ones, but also as healthcare professionals who were at the sharp end, who were on the frontline.

When assessing how well and how prepared and how effective healthcare systems in this country were in facing the pandemic, these are the very individuals who are actually and who can provide actual factual evidence in terms of what was happening. This, we say, will add immense value to the Inquiry.

Secondly, healthcare, health inequalities and discrimination. My Lady, this is found at paragraphs 24 to 25 of our written submissions. We say it needs repeating and it benefits from repeating that those who suffered issues of discrimination and inequalities as explored in Module 1 and will be explored in Module 2, cannot be seen in isolation. These are recurring threads that will flow throughout all the modules, my Lady, that you will be hearing. Sadly, Covid-19 was not an equal opportunities pandemic, and it exposed the existing fault lines and discrimination and inequality within society.

We urge the Inquiry, when considering the response of the healthcare systems, to look carefully at the effects upon persons who have historically faced discrimination in healthcare, and also to expand upon that which was discussed in Module 1 and to consider individuals such as neurodivergent people, those with intellectual disabilities and those with mental health conditions.

My Lady, we note what was said a moment ago about adults detained under the Mental Health Act, but repeat and emphasise our submissions that those with mental health conditions, both in the community and facilities, need to be fully addressed in Module 3.

This is not a niche area. Those suffering from poor mental health make up a large section of our population. How they experienced the pandemic must be a significant aspect to be considered.

The Module 1 experts on issues of discrimination and the many other witnesses that we heard who provided a wealth of evidence was indeed detailed and comprehensive. It was perhaps some of the clearest, most erudite and most eloquently delivered evidence that we heard in Module 1 from those various witnesses.

We note that Professors Marmot and Bambra, Professor Heymann and Dr Kirchhelle have -- their reports and transcripts have been disclosed and will be disclosed into Module 3.

We also note paragraph 30 of CTI's note of 29 August of this year that the Inquiry will also be disclosing discrimination reports from Module 2. I'm grateful for the indication that we received this morning, and a broad outline of those, the nature of some of those reports.

However, my Lady, we still submit that Module 3 will perhaps require reports, not new reports per se, but reports perhaps with a different focus. If the same experts are effectively reinstructed, fresh letters of instruction could be drafted that direct those experts to address matters pertaining and pertinent to the scope of Module 3. It's important, we say, not to have the mindset that "Well, we've done discrimination, let's move on", and reports can seamlessly be slotted into different modules. Matters are more nuanced than that, as I'm sure, my Lady, you appreciate.

Three, scheduling and timetable. We addressed these at paragraphs 31 to 40 of our written document. My Lady, I've heard what has just been said about timetable, and of course there's a balance to be struck between having an Inquiry of an appropriate length, but also concluding and reporting as swiftly as possible, because there is a pressing need to make changes. This country must prepare itself for the next and sadly inevitable pandemic, and we need this Inquiry to report as soon as possible.

Against that, however, we say it is also vital that the Inquiry has sufficient time to examine and scrutinise those relevant matters and answer, as far as it is possible, the questions it poses itself. To do that effectively, it will be necessary to consider matters in as much depth and in as much detail as necessary. It is important that the conclusions and recommendations are informed and evidence based. The better the evidence, the better the conclusions, the better the recommendations.

The families are at the front and centre of this Inquiry, as has been said many times. It was their campaigning that in many respects brought about this Inquiry. They want to make sure that it has teeth, and that it has a lasting legacy. We, on their behalf, likewise, want to make sure that the integrity of this Inquiry is at its highest. We do not want to see a situation whereby post-publication the recommendations are kicked into the long grass by the government, or that the Inquiry, like many before it, is consigned to be known by the name of its Chair rather than by the contents of its work and the changes it can make.

So that is why we say it is so important to have sufficient time to hear the evidence and that it is done with sufficient detail. We want there to be a realistic timetable, and we simply say -- and we set out very detailed calculations, but we simply say, to put it simply, that ten weeks is not enough, and we would invite you, my Lady, and the Inquiry team to carefully consider both the oral and written submissions we make about the time.

In terms of sequence, even if Module 4 takes place before Module 3, we do urge the Inquiry to list Module 6, social care, to be directly after Module 3, thereby effectively leapfrogging Module 5, on procurement.

Our submission in that respect is simple. Waiting four or perhaps five years after what our families see as the scandal of the care homes of spring 2020 would be a failure to ensure speedy justice, and it would be letting the families down. Also, to put it bluntly, and sadly, many of the survivors of the care homes may not be with us in four to five years' time.

**Lady Hallett**: Ms Munroe, I'm entirely sympathetic to that. Of course I appreciate and understand it, but one of the problems that I think maybe some people haven't really considered is the demands that the Inquiry is making on material providers, and when you have modules that are health related or care related, the demands are going to be on the same providers, and it's really a case of what's doable. But, I mean, obviously I always bear in mind your submissions, they're always helpful, but it is extraordinarily difficult. We have heard this morning the difficulty in getting material from some providers. So I do understand, of course I do, and I have looked into it several times, but there are restrictions on me that I haven't placed there.

**Ms Munroe**: My Lady, yes.

**Lady Hallett**: But obviously I will bear everything you say in mind with great care.

**Ms Munroe**: I'm grateful, thank you.

Fourth topic point, experts. Again, we set out in our written submissions at paragraphs 16 to 17 in detail what we say about that. Suffice to say this: given that healthcare is a devolved matter, we say there is also a need for independent experts who understand the state of individual healthcare systems before and during the pandemic and that they should be instructed by the Inquiry.

Our colleagues from Northern Ireland will be making further submissions in due course, generally and specifically on this point, I defer to them, but in advance I also endorse and adopt their submissions.

My Lady, you will remember perhaps another thing that came out very starkly from Module 1 was Northern Ireland, as a nation, how that nation is treated, how that nation is perceived, and the different treatment of the people of Northern Ireland, and the different systems that operate. It's complicated, but it's important to bear that in mind, and, as I say, my colleagues will in due course make further submissions.

In terms of the critical care experts, we set out at paragraphs 18 to 21 of the written submissions our thoughts there.

My Lady, I'm grateful for what has been said this morning about those two experts, who of course are hugely experienced and have great expertise in their areas. We make the simple point that independence of expert witnesses is obviously a crucial aspect of ensuring that their reports have integrity and value, and one doesn't want there to be the perception that any expert witness would lack independence as an expert.

The letters of instructions have not been provided for these or indeed any of the experts, and that may be something that can be of assistance, help to allay any fears, and we would ask that the letters of instructions are circulated.

CTI's note of 29 August lists topics by bullet points which form the two experts' reports and what they have been asked to comment upon. We simply suggest that "resourcing within ICU/CCU" should also include surge capacity of ICU beds as well as staffing resource within ICU units, and we also suggest that the list includes development and dissemination to clinicians of guidance on Covid care and treatment.

Finally, five, Rule 9 and disclosure. That's at paragraph 14, particularly, of our written submissions.

My Lady, we note and we share the frustration of CTI that in terms of the tardiness, we'll put it no higher than that, and in some instances complete lack of response to the Rule 9 requests, that is extremely unhelpful. It has a knock-on effect, not only on the investigative work that the Inquiry has to do, but then disclosure. That has a knock-on effect on the core participants in preparing for their own questions, and preparing generally.

It's also extremely worrying, to say the least, that there has been destruction of any documents, and, my Lady, I'm sure you will want full and proper explanations from the relevant parties as to why that happened, how it happened, and to ensure it doesn't happen, because this module is some many months ahead, and there are undoubtedly many other documents that will need to be considered.

Accessing mailboxes, that's not an insurmountable problem. It may cost a little bit of money, it may require some technical assistance, but I'm sure that that can be rectified, and that shouldn't be a reason why, again, emails, et cetera, are not disclosed.

Disclosure has now begun for Module 3, and we welcome that, and we hope that it continues in a timely fashion. Whilst inevitably there may still be some disclosure once we begin Module 3, we hope we're not in the situation that unfortunately we found ourselves in Module 1, where disclosure was still ongoing for particular witnesses after they gave their evidence, which is extremely frustrating for everyone but also means that potentially areas that may have been explored further were not and we could not do that.

So that is obviously a problem that we hope we don't encounter in Module 3, and we would simply urge and hope that, as far as possible, all disclosure can be made before the commencements of the hearings.

My Lady, as I mentioned at the start of these brief oral submissions, if there are matters in our document that I haven't mentioned, we do nonetheless say that they are all of importance and we would ask you to consider them carefully and, where appropriate, to adopt them.

My Lady, those are our submissions for today's preliminary hearing.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms Munroe, and thank you for taking the trouble to focus. I know sometimes it takes more time to shorten submissions than it does just to read out one's written submissions, so thank you very much indeed, both for the content and for the trouble you've taken.

**Ms Munroe**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: I think we will break now, if you can wait, Ms McDermott, until after the break. It's now 20 to, I shall be back at five to.

*(11.41 am)*

*(A short break)*

*(11.55 am)*

**Lady Hallett**: Yes, Ms McDermott.
