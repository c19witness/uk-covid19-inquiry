8. Submissions on Behalf of John's Campaign, Care Rights UK (formerly the Relatives and Residents Association) and the Patients Association by Mr Straw KC
===========================================================================================================================================================

**Mr Straw**: Thank you.

Good afternoon. I represent John's Campaign, the Patients Association and Care Rights UK. I act alongside Jessica Jones and I'm instructed by Leigh Day and Carolin Ott in particular is here today.

My Lady, there are three topics I hope to address today:

A. The list of issues.

B. The overlap of this module with Module 6.

C. Evidence.

So topic A, the list of issues. This is an extremely helpful document and the Inquiry clearly has a huge amount of work to do for this module.

However, there are two topics which we would respectfully invite you to include within the list of issues. Those are broadly, firstly, healthcare outside the clinical setting and, secondly, unpaid and family carers. I'll take those in turn now.

So the first topic, the list of issues is focused on the clinical setting, and by that I mean in hospital, GP surgeries and ambulances and so on. What it omits is healthcare provided outside that setting, at so home, in the care home, community, mental health treatment and so on.

Now, many people received very important healthcare outside the clinical setting, so that may be because they were disabled or vulnerable and therefore unable to get to hospital or otherwise, and in some respects the biggest impact the pandemic had on healthcare was on those outside the clinical setting. And that's partly because in a lot of cases restrictions completely cut off access to healthcare for long periods.

The importance of healthcare outside the clinical setting might be illustrated by statistics. So, for example, the King's Fund identified excess home deaths, so the number of home deaths additional to what would normally be expected, in the period from 14 March 2020 to July 2022 as being 100,000, but only 3% of those were from Covid. What that suggests is that the restrictions put in place as a response to Covid were responsible for some 97,000 additional home deaths during that period.

Another reason why we submit non-clinical setting healthcare should be investigated is that this setting raises different but discrete issues. So the policies or restrictions that were imposed in this area were different. The impact of those policies and restrictions was different. The withdrawal of healthcare was more extreme, as I've indicated. The availability, for example, of PPE was different. The appropriate response in this context was also different, reflecting, for example, the fact that people at home or in care homes have different healthcare needs, they often have mobility and communication problems, they're often particularly vulnerable.

So for those reasons we respectfully submit that the list of issues should add a number of specific issues concerning non-clinical setting healthcare, and we've set those out in more detail in our written submissions.

Finally on this topic, our clients support the submissions which have been made by Mind to the effect that this module should look in more detail into mental health community services.

The second area which we submit should be added to the list of issues concerns unpaid and family carers. Unpaid and family carers played a vital role in healthcare now and during the pandemic. There are more than 5 million carers in the UK. They are estimated to contribute to the UK economy a figure of about the same as the budget of the NHS, so some Â£162 billion a year in recent estimates.

Unpaid and family carers play an essential role in healthcare, for example they provide healthcare, they administer medication, treatment and care plans, they monitor and assess conditions, and they also communicate with professionals for those patients who are unable to communicate for themselves.

We strongly support the PBPOs' submissions that loved ones play a key role in care. Again, a reason why we submit that the role of unpaid and family carers should be included in the list of issues is that different and discrete issues again arise in this context for investigation. Policies and decisions concerning unpaid and family carers were different, for example little thought was given to PPE. These workers were not designated as key workers. The impact of the pandemic was different on unpaid and family workers. Again, in many cases restrictions completely cut off access to care and healthcare provided by those individuals. And the nature of healthcare in this context is also different, so it's more daily, long-term monitoring and treatment rather than sort of one-off or isolated appointments.

Adding unpaid and family carers to the list of issues would be consistent with the introduction to the list of issues which recognised that this module should look at the unequal impact of the pandemic on vulnerable healthcare workers. This army of unpaid and family healthcare workers were vulnerable and the pandemic had an unequal impact on them. But the remainder of the list of issues does not include them.

Again, we make specific suggestions for changes in our written submissions in paragraph 11.

So that's issue A.

Issue B, the overlap of this module with Module 6, and the Module 6 is the care module.

Care and healthcare, my Lady, in many contexts are inseparable. This has been repeatedly recognised by the government and the health service. Just to pick two examples, in the 2022 White Paper, Health and Social Care Integration, the foreword said:

"We have been reminded, once more, of the inextricable link between health services and social care."

Similarly a 2021 policy paper on this issued by the Department of Health and Social Care said:

"... the case couldn't be clearer for joining up and integrating care around people rather than around institutional silos ..."

The overlap between the two might be illustrated by the particular example of dementia. Dementia is, of course, a critical healthcare issue. My Lady, it is the leading cause of death in the UK. But as the national dementia strategy, which we have quoted in our submissions, makes clear, care and healthcare for dementia are inseparable, they are the same thing.

Pick the example of infection control. Infections for dementia sufferers are one of the biggest causes of death. How infection control is effectively delivered is a mixture of care and healthcare. So checking the patient for sores, communicating with the patient effectively, in particular those who lack capacity, moving the patient to prevent sores developing, applying treatment and medication. Again, they're part and parcel of the same thing.

This inextricable link between care and healthcare, we respectfully submit, should have five implications for the Inquiry.

Firstly, it's important that the Inquiry takes a holistic approach and does not create the institutional silos which the government warned against. Investigation of the impacts of Covid on healthcare will have to examine the impact on care, where there is this overlap.

To put the point slightly differently, it's not possible in a number of contexts to properly answer whether the response to Covid, whether the restrictions imposed, were appropriate, unless one considers the impact of those restrictions on both healthcare and care.

Take the example of visits out of a care home to a hospital. For a long period those were prohibited and then they were prohibited other than in exceptional cases, when the returning patient would have to completely isolate for 14 days. This meant that the patient couldn't access healthcare or care, and both of those were dangerous and potentially fatal in some cases.

Now, returning to my point, one can't really answer the question as to whether those restrictions were appropriate unless one considers both the impact that they had on the healthcare and also the impact that they had on care.

The second implication is we would respectfully invite the Inquiry to ensure that Module 3 and Module 6 run in tandem, so evidence from each should be shared and should be available to inform the other.

Similarly, implication 3, issues which overlap, so the issues which both fall into the healthcare and the care camps, it would be extremely helpful if the Inquiry could clarify at an early stage which of the two modules will investigate overlapping issues, and how it will do so. That's because if we know, for the purposes of this module, that Module 6 will be investigating an issue, then that will inform the submissions we make on things like list of issues and witnesses.

Again, I'd like to illustrate that with the example of dementia. In this module, the list of issues at 5C lists four conditions which be investigated as focused conditions. We made submissions that dementia should be added to that list as a fifth condition. The Inquiry's response to that included that Module 6 would be better placed to investigate dementia.

Now, it would be, as I say, very helpful if that could be confirmed, so if it could be confirmed in particular that Module 6 will investigate the impact of the pandemic on healthcare and care of those with dementia. And the reasons, just briefly, why it should be investigated are as follows:

Firstly, the importance of dementia. It's, as I said, the biggest cause of death in the UK, a million people suffer from it, but secondly, that particular and discrete issues are raised about dementia which otherwise won't be investigated.

So the national dementia strategy explains home and family care for dementia sufferers are the most important services. Dementia sufferers often lack the ability to communicate or lack capacity. Care and treatment is of a particular sort, it's daily, intensive and over the long term, and many dementia sufferers are clinically vulnerable.

So the issues that will arise in the investigation of dementia aren't covered by the other four conditions in 5C of the list of issues.

However, those issues are not just limited to dementia, they cover a number of other conditions such as degenerative conditions, and so the investigation of dementia would have broader importance.

My Lady, the fourth implication of this overlap is about timing, and you've already had an exchange with Ms Munroe KC about this this morning, and I'll try not to repeat that, but we have two points really about timing. Firstly, given the overlap, it would be very helpful if the hearings in Modules 3 and 6 could take place closely together, and if final reports from both could be delayed until the end of the hearings of both, so that evidence from the hearings can inform both reports.

The second point about timing is, of course, urgency. We readily appreciate the huge amount the Inquiry has to do and the difficulty in preparing for these hearings, but if any way can be found to prioritise the care module and this module in particular, then there are very strong reasons why that should be done.

Some of those were canvassed in the last hearing and I won't repeat those other than to say the restrictions remain in place and they remain onerous. But another reason, which Ms Munroe touched upon, is that evidence from the people affected by the pandemic, the patients and so on in particular, will be critical for the Inquiry and the Inquiry's made it clear that that's very important to them. But by spring 2025, to put it bluntly, most care home residents from 2020 will be dead or will at least have forgotten what happened. So if the Inquiry wants to hear from them, something will need to be done very quickly.

In that context, it is of course of great concern to hear about the delay from the Department of Health and others in providing witness statements.

The fifth and final implication of this overlap, my Lady, is to really re-emphasise the importance of this Inquiry focusing on the person rather than the setting. To borrow from the Department of Health and Social Care report, the case couldn't be clearer for joining up and integrating the investigation of healthcare and care around people rather than institutional silos.

My Lady, topic C, and this is a short topic, is evidence. In our written submissions we've invited the Inquiry to instruct an expert about the critical role of carers in healthcare, and in particular the impact of the pandemic and the response on healthcare provided by carers and on the carers themselves. We'd be very happy to identify particular experts if that would help.

On the topic of expert reports, it would be very helpful if we could be given the instructions that experts receive at the same time as the reports, not before so. That's because it can be very difficult to understand opinions or the validity of those opinions in the absence of the instructions. It's done routinely in civil litigation and the reasons why it's done there apply equally here, and it also helps focus our further questions.

Every Story Matters. We would be grateful if the Inquiry could clarify how and when the information from Every Story Matters will be brought into the modules, and it would be helpful if possible if that can be done earlier rather than later so that it can inform the list of issues and the evidence which is obtained.

So, in conclusion, my Lady, we readily recognise the Inquiry has a huge amount of work to do in this module, but we respectfully submit that the investigation of the additional issues which we have identified in our submissions is critical to the proper examination of the pandemic on healthcare.

Those are my submissions.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much, Mr Straw. In relation to Every Story Matters I can only repeat what we've said a number of times, the Inquiry team try to keep all the core participants fully informed of what's happening with Every Story Matters, and Ms Carey this morning went into some detail as to how the reports would be prepared and how they would be used, but obviously I will yet again check with the team if there's anything more we can say, but we are doing out very best to keep everybody fully informed.

**Mr Straw**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

Ms Davies.
