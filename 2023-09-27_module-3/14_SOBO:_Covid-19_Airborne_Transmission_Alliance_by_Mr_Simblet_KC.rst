14. Submissions on Behalf of the Covid-19 airborne Transmission Alliance by Mr Simblet KC
=========================================================================================

**Mr Simblet**: Thank you, my Lady.

Well, my Lady, I make these submissions along with Mr Dayle, from whom you have just heard for FEHMO, and instructed by Saunders Law, on behalf of the COVID-19 :outline:`airborne` Transmission Alliance, or CATA.

In addition to submitting a detailed Rule 9 statement, CATA's provided its written submissions ahead of this hearing, and obviously I don't propose to repeat those in full, but CATA would want others to be able to read them.

Your counsel referred this morning to your discretion to publish submissions. We invite you in a public inquiry to publish the submissions that you've received.

There are still some particular points to highlight, and to append.

First, we wish to convey CATA's gratitude to the Inquiry for incorporating into the provisional Module 3 list of issues so many of the points that we'd raised earlier as to the appropriate lines of enquiry, and CATA remains cautiously optimistic that the Inquiry will carry out a thorough investigation of these Module 3 issues, and presumably that will include, as you mentioned this morning, my Lady, taking a robust attitude to those who impede the Inquiry by not supplying material when required.

It is in the spirit of constructive engagement that I would like first -- a substantive point -- to address something that we've raised in our paragraph 22 of our written submissions, and to which others have referred, and that is: CATA wants the Inquiry to take an expansive approach in its understanding and investigation of what is termed "healthcare".

CATA has previously pointed out that it's wrong to see healthcare provision as confined to hospital settings, and we commend the submissions of, for example, among several others, those from Mind and those made by the John's Campaign, Patients Association and Care Rights UK, that the healthcare provision is seen as well beyond hospital settings.

It appears from what Ms Carey was submitting this morning that your counsel at least or the Inquiry's position may not be that. But we say that it is essential for a thorough investigation on the impact on healthcare provision during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.

Like so many matters pertaining to the proper understanding of Covid-19, the appreciation of systems and their interdependence will first enable the Inquiry to see what went wrong, and secondly, discourage people in the future from departing from practices and procedures without a proper rationale. It is that issue of people departing from already established practices and procedures that is a particular concern and particular central contention of CATA.

The guidance provided to healthcare workers during the pandemic was erroneous, confused and confusing. One stark example is the UK Government's "Hands, Face, Space" campaign. That phrase initially sidelined the :outline:`airborne` route of transmission of Covid-19 altogether. Indeed, it wasn't until 29 March 2021 that the slogan was modified to "Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air". But even with that additional "fresh air" component instruction, there was further confusion for healthcare workers because this instruction did not seem to be being applied in healthcare settings.

Although the slogan now recognised the threat of the :outline:`airborne` route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, healthcare workers were still denied adequate protection against :outline:`airborne` transmission, and this problem was embedded in successive infection prevention and control cell guidance throughout the pandemic. There was a fundamental disconnect between the advice being given to the general public and those working in healthcare settings, and CATA wants to understand why.

At the last preliminary Module 3 hearing, CATA drew attention to the contention in written submissions from NHS England that at the start of the pandemic, to quote what they said, little was known about the novel coronavirus. CATA submitted and maintains that this is wrong. In fact, the position is the opposite of what NHS England submitted there, as we have previously submitted. A lot was already known about beta coronaviruses, and their transmission via an :outline:`airborne` route. Thus, as we know, SARS CoV-1 was and remains classified as an :outline:`airborne` high-consequence infectious disease. So even if, for the sake of argument, little was known, it nevertheless was known that this was SARS-CoV-2, and that the existing measures to address SARS CoV-1 and its :outline:`airborne` nature, which were known about and in place, we say should have led to obvious and basic scientific approaches in relation to the prediction of a precautionary principle, which essentially means unless there was clear, compelling and indisputable evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was not transmitted via an :outline:`airborne` route, that the proper public health response should have been to take sufficient measures to protect everyone, including healthcare workers, from a virus that could transmit via the air.

In fact there was no clear or sufficient scientific evidence for it to be asserted at the start of the pandemic that SARS-CoV-2 was not spread by the :outline:`airborne` route, nor sufficient scientific justification to make some of the other consequential decisions.

In that context, it was therefore wrong, we say, in March 2020 to remove SARS-CoV-2's status as a high-consequence infectious disease and, on the very same day, to downgrade protective equipment for healthcare workers from effective respiratory protective equipment, or RPE, to FRSMs, save in relation to some particular specific medical procedures which were arbitrarily classified as :outline:`aerosol generating procedures`.

Essentially, my Lady, the failure either to recognise the :outline:`airborne` route or to apply the precautionary principle in the formulation of infection prevention and control guidance had profound implications for the safety of patients and healthcare workers and the future of the NHS more generally.

This failure is most stark in the context of IPC cell guidance which, contrary to other government and public health bodies' eventual recognition of the :outline:`airborne` route of transmission, has never recognised this route of transmission nor recommended appropriate RPE for healthcare workers caring for infectious patients.

It seems to CATA that all of this likely arose from a lack of resources. CATA's very concerned about this, as is a large percentage of those who worked in the healthcare centre during the pandemic, and CATA asks that this issue is fully, rigorously and courageously explored.

CATA repeatedly tried to engage with governmental institutions and public bodies on this and other questions throughout the pandemic, but was routinely ignored or treated as an inconvenience, despite a large membership and wealth of expertise, and the lack of transparency and stakeholder engagement in such processes resulted in widespread confusion and frustration in the healthcare sector. It even led to some member organisations having to take it upon themselves to devise their own guidance to assist their concerned members.

So CATA therefore asks the Inquiry to uncover the manner in which the IPC cell guidance was produced. It's a process that until now remains shrouded in secrecy, and the relevant minutes of meetings and so on remain unpublished.

So on the topic, you've heard other submissions today which are welcomed by CATA from, for instance, the Royal College of Nursing, the TUC, FEHMO and others, about RPE and its suitability, and of course CATA agrees with Mind, FEHMO and the Frontline Migrant Health Workers Group that Covid and measures to combat it impacted different racial groups differentially.

One key issue which we say will need to be looked at carefully was the failure to provide RPE suitable for all persons irrespective of their ethnicity, gender or other characteristics. We've made some submissions in our written submissions at around paragraph 21 in relation to things such as different types of faces and sizes and so on, but essentially CATA's submission is that the procurement and provision of suitable RPE was not properly managed with regard to the diversity of the healthcare workforce.

The inadequacy of protective equipment features along another central concern of CATA, namely the reporting by healthcare workers -- or the non-reporting, as it may be more appropriately described -- under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrence Regulations 2013, or RIDDOR.

The Inquiry has agreed to investigate this, and CATA considers that an important area of investigation because, in its experience, there was a gross under-reporting under RIDDOR of healthcare worker contracted Covid-19 illnesses and deaths; and this under-reporting was not due to the healthcare workers themselves not raising it, it is to do with the circumstances created by situations in the health service and attitudes taken to the relevant law.

It is known that there were amendments to the law relating to coroners' inquests for Covid-19 which essentially removed a level of judicial scrutiny for certain deaths.

That approach was also applied in relation to RIDDOR, and there was a radical and, CATA would submit, egregious departure from existing health and safety law. Healthcare workers were told that it was not necessary to report Covid-19 infections for various reasons, for instance, the suggestion that RIDDOR would not apply because their trusts were complying with government guidance, or that workers were being given adequate PPE.

CATA says this was and remains incorrect, both factually and practically, and was not in compliance with the law.

There are also other ways in which Covid-19 illnesses and deaths have been under-reported, for instance, the imposition of an artificially high standard of proof in relation to the source of the infection and the expectation that people would be required to proof that this had been contracted at work.

CATA has serious concerns about maladministration at the highest levels of public health and policy apparatus in the application or disapplication of health and safety legislation during the pandemic. Some of those have in fact already been aired during a BBC Panorama investigation, but CATA submits that the Inquiry will need further to investigate whether health and safety standards were ditched and, if so, why, if it is to discharge its function sufficiently.

Now, this is an ongoing issue, because the disapplication of health and safety standards has and will continue to have a profound impact on society at large. The lack of data collected about healthcare worker illnesses and deaths contracted at work due to this under-reporting means that the extent of the impact of the pandemic on healthcare workers was hidden. This affected their ability to respond during the pandemic, and hinders planning and preparedness for future pandemics.

Additionally, my Lady, it's also a matter of justice for healthcare workers. Many suffered serious financial detriment from contraction of the Covid-19 virus while working on, essentially, the frontlines to protect the public during the most severe national emergency since the Second World War.

The failure to record healthcare workers' infections with Covid-19 while at work could limit their routes to potential compensation, and for many healthcare workers this is already a real and present issue. For example, some are struggling to obtain sick pay, or payments under the NHS Injury Allowance insurance scheme, which tops up NHS workers' pay to 85% of their salary for a year where on long-term absence from work due to accident or disease.

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Simblet, I appreciate you're speaking really quickly to try and get through it. You're already over time, I'm afraid. I'm going to have to ask you to speak more slowly and to finish now.

**Mr Simblet**: Yes, I'm pretty well at the end.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you.

**Mr Simblet**: Thank you, my Lady.

CATA endorses the proposal made by the RCN for a compensation scheme and the suggestions that we've heard today about long Covid being recognised as a disability under the Equality Act.

So, finally, if I can make a couple of points in relation to the use of experts. CATA has previously suggested potentially suitable experts. It would be interested in assisting the Inquiry further in relation to the composition of the expert panel and the instructions they are given, and we will be making our own representations after today on those sorts of topics. But I hope, my Lady, that you will see that CATA engages constructively with the Inquiry and will be keen to assist it as far as it possibly can.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Simblet, and thank you for the offer of assistance.

Right, Diya Sen Gupta KC. There you are.
