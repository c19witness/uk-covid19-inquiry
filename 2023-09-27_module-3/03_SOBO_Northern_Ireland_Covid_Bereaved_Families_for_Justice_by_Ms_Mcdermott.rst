3. Submissions on Behalf of Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice by Ms Mcdermott
=================================================================================================

**Ms McDermott**: Good morning, my Lady.

As you know, I represent the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, led by Brenda Campbell KC, Peter Wilcock KC and instructed by PA Duffy Solicitors.

May I start by thanking you for the opportunity to address you on Module 3.

Many of our group will, like me, be doing their best to avoid Storm Agnes today and will be following remotely or catching up online, and I would like to welcome and recognise their unfailing commitment to this Inquiry.

They will have listened intently to the observations we've just heard and will no doubt have strong feelings about the lack of response to Rule 9 requests by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland.

We share the concern that these delays and the detrimental effect that they will have on Module 3. Of course, my Lady, we will keep under review the possibility of a section 21 order as the hearing date hurtles closer.

Now, as your Ladyship has already observed in the last preliminary hearing for this module, Module 3 is huge. The core issues have been carefully set out by my learned friend Ms Carey this morning, and on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, whom I shall refer to as the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved, we lean into those submissions and welcome the observations made, which we will reflect upon further.

I'm aware that there are a lot of speakers today and I will try to be concise and focus on only a couple of points. That does not mean to say that by doing so I am abandoning or pushing down the priority list those matters as set out in our written submissions. Rather, I make these submissions to emphasise and complement those that have already been placed before you in writing, as well as outlined this morning by Ms Munroe KC in her characteristically skilled oral submissions.

Firstly, and in sharp focus for the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved, are the experiences of the bereaved families. In both Module 1 and Module 2, the accounts of the families have been limited by the argument that they do not have first-hand witness evidence in respect of the high-level political decision making, preparedness or political response. That refrain holds no traction in Module 3. For your Ladyship to have a real understanding of what the impact of policies and procedures within the healthcare meant for patients and their loved ones, you must view the outcomes through the prism of real experience of real people.

It is a matter of fact that the families are well placed to inform the issues under consideration in this module. Indeed, the very first paragraph of Module 3's scope states that this module will examine the impact of Covid-19 on people's experience of the healthcare.

Many of our members strongly believed that their loved ones were allowed to be exposed to Covid-19 and that the health and social care structures in Northern Ireland were so devoid of resilience in the pandemic that it was inevitable their loved ones would contract Covid-19. In short, they believe their loved ones were effectively given Covid-19 because nothing was done to prevent it. We've many examples of bereaved families attending healthcare settings for relatively routine treatments only to be infected with the virus which proved to be fatal.

Within the hospital setting, many of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved give accounts of apparent failures to use PPE in hospital. These issues naturally give rise to the concern either there were inadequate supplies of PPE or that there were inadequate instructions on how and when it should be used.

One of our members recounts how her father reported staff were wearing masks around their chins, with one individual putting the mask on after leaving the ward, or how other patients moved freely in and out of hospital buildings with no masks at all. He and his family continually raised this and enquired about the potential exposure to Covid-19. On 1 October 2021 he tested positive for Covid-19 and died less than three weeks later.

In a similar vein are the concerns about the suitability and availability of the much needed equipment in Northern Ireland. One Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved discovered following the death of her loved one and an investigation that the ventilation system on the ward was faulty and inadequate prior to the outbreak.

Other Northern Ireland group members have expressed anxiety regarding the perceived use or misuse of palliative care in hospital. This includes use such as midazolam and/or morphine in end of life care, and the use of risperidone to sedate patients, as well as issues around withholding of water. Many members have painted very distressing portraits of coming upon their loved ones in a state of dehydration.

There is sadly a belief amongst some of our members that in some cases their loved ones' lives were, in effect, actively ended by healthcare professionals.

By way of examples, two sisters have shared their account of how their mother tested positive for Covid on 31 March and died on 7 April 2020. They comment:

"They gave her sedation, midazolam and morphine, and they ultimately believed that they knew they were going to need the beds for younger people and giving sedation drugs were simply a form of euthanasia."

It is common case that people were discharged from the NHS estate into care homes, ostensibly to protect the NHS. In many cases, GPs refused to visit care homes and care home residents requiring hospital care were denied it. Many of our group believe that the care homes were flooded with patients who were discharged from hospitals to home settings without being tested or in isolation, despite the awareness of the risks of asymptomatic transmission from the early stages of the pandemic.

Before the pandemic hit our shores, Northern Ireland's healthcare system was in a state of functional collapse. The health and social care system was unfit to withstand the necessary additional surge capacity that was required for the pandemic to be fought on any proper footing. Surge capacity came about due to the redirecting and standing down of other services. It did not have additionality. The waiting lists were, as your Ladyship has heard, far worse in Northern Ireland than in any other part of the UK. For the people of Northern Ireland, that meant 57% of those on a waiting list have been on there for a year compared to 9% of the waiting list population in England.

In Module 1, Mr Robin Swann MLA, the Minister for Health, gave evidence and expressed the view that Stormont had let down the healthcare system in Northern Ireland because it had not looked after the health and social care services as well as it could and that vital services had been underfunded, short-term decisions preferred over long-term planning, and difficult choices were ducked and staff were left to feel unappreciated, with social care being particularly neglected.

Michelle O'Neill, his predecessor and First Minister for Northern Ireland, noted to your Ladyship in July this year that it was evident to her, in her previous tenure in a health minister post, that the system demanded transformation on how healthcare was delivered. She described "report fatigue" in the Department of Health from day one and that an action plan was needed to transform and fix the healthcare service and tackle health inequalities.

Unfortunately, the reforms envisaged had not been employed, such that Sir Michael McBride, the Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland, stated in his evidence that the Department of Health was inadequately resourced to respond to the multiple and competing demands of an emergency.

My Lady, that emergency came, and it came in the form of the Covid-19 pandemic. The well-documented failure to invest undoubtedly adversely impacted on how Northern Ireland and the social care system responded, and undoubtedly those who work in healthcare came up with a response plan, with policies and procedures that stemmed from emergency care to access to general practitioners.

However, in order for you to really understand where there were failings and to come to conclusions that are likely to result in real and much needed change, you must hear the direct experiences of those who bore the brunt, who lost loved ones, and have much to say about where lessons are to be learned and how the changes must be implemented.

This module will not serve its core purpose if it does not move on from a paper-based reporting and consider real people, real experiences and the very real and heartbreaking outcomes.

For those reasons, my Lady, Northern Ireland is reliant on this module in combination with M2, 2C and M6 in particular, to provide a report that goes a long way to fixing a broken health and social care system, so that when the next pandemic comes, fewer families will be bereaved. In order to do so meaningfully, the Inquiry should call upon an expert's evidence on the Northern Ireland health and social care system to assist as a guide to you through our unique system within the UK. Pertinently, Northern Ireland has a fully integrated system of healthcare and processing(?) around social services, referred to health and social care.

We acknowledge that a single expert might provide sufficient expertise across the modules, given that many and much overlap. Without that expert evidence, however, we contend that when it comes to understanding the impact of Covid-19 on the Northern Ireland health and social care services, the Inquiry will be much the poorer. We urge communication between the modules and -- in this module and M2C and with the Northern Ireland core participants in order to identify and instruct a suitable expert.

Unless, my Lady, there are any matters on which I can particularly assist you with, those are the submissions on behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid Bereaved Families for Justice.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Ms McDermott, I'm very grateful to you.

I think Ms Mitchell's also attending remotely, I think. Ms Mitchell King's Counsel.
