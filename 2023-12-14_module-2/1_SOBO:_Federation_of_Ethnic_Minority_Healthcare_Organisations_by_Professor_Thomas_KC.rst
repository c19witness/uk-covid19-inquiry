Transcript of Module 2 Public Hearing on 14 December 2023

*(10.00 am)*

**Lady Hallett**: Good morning, everyone.

Mr Thomas.

1. Submissions on Behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations by Professor Thomas KC
=============================================================================================================

**Professor Thomas**: Good morning, my Lady.

My Lady, I would like to start by reflecting back on some of what was said by Ade Adeyemi on behalf of FEMHO in the first week of the hearing:

"... the system can pick up signals and noise and disruption in other areas, but when there's noise and disruption of black, Asian ethnic minority workers, it's not heard, and it's not responded to immediately.

"... when we did say ... things, and when systemically it's happening across the NHS system, across the country, it's not being immediately believed, it's not being immediately responded to, it creates that understanding or perception that there is an institutional systemic response to one set of problems, and for our members, black and Asian ethnic minority workers, there is a different systemic response ..."

That was said on Day 4.

My Lady, the pandemic was more than just a medical challenge, it was also a political, social and economic event. It was a human rights crisis. It magnified, we say, human-made inequalities where policy reasons or a lack thereof had profound consequences on the lives of black, Asian and minority ethnic people.

As a matter of public health, societal factors, and in particular socioeconomic factors, combined to produce adverse, discriminatory outcomes. This is a reflection of structural inequality. Properly put, in the context of black, Asian and minority ethnic people, it's structural racism. As Ade Adeyemi put it, and I'm sure you'll remember this quote, my Lady, "If it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck, [then] it's a duck". These facts, as a result of the evidence heard in this module, are now firmly at the forefront of public thinking about the pandemic.

FEMHO advocates for the rights of healthcare workers on the broader principle that the government's action, or inaction, affects every individual within the wider communities. The decisions made within the corridors of power, in central government, or failures to make appropriate strategic decisions during the Covid-19 crisis, have driven and exacerbated long-standing inequalities within the black, Asian and minority ethnic healthcare workforce and communities.

Now, my Lady, allow me to repeat some of the facts that we've heard during the module about mortality, which paint a dire picture of the unequal impact of Covid-19 on ethnic minority healthcare workers.

You will remember, because it was much quoted, that Guardian newspaper article of 10 April 2020. You know, the one that reports that the first ten doctors who died from Covid-19 were doctors of colour.

This devastating fact is not merely a statistic, but it also represents the tragic loss of skilled workers, skilled individuals who put their lives on the line for the care and protection of others.

Within the NHS, a beacon of healthcare excellence globally, 1.2 to 1.5 million workers are from ethnic minority backgrounds. This is a testament to the rich diversity that makes our healthcare system resilient and renowned. Yet these very same individuals faced disproportionate risks and burdens during the pandemic, exposing a deep-seated issue that demands public attention.

The gravity of the situation becomes even more pronounced when we further examine the mortality rates. My Lady, did you know in intensive care units, where life hung in the balance, 30% to 35% of the patients were from ethnic minority backgrounds? Staggeringly, black males were found to be 4.2 times more likely to die from Covid-19-related deaths than their white counterparts, while black females faced a 4.3 times higher risk. These numbers reflect the harsh reality of a healthcare system that perpetuates inequality. Behind each number lies a human story, a life lost, a family forever changed. These figures demand more than just our acknowledgement; they demand swift and decisive action to reflect the structural issues that led to such disparities.

Now, the big question, the why. Let's delve into that question of why black, Asian and minority ethnic healthcare workers were disproportionately affected during the pandemic. Professor Nazroo defined structural racism as follows:

"Historical and ongoing structural racism means that ethnicity remains strongly associated with social location, status and power, leading to inequalities in access to key economic, physical, political, social and cultural resources."

That's INQ000280057_0015, paragraph 42 for the reference.

Structural racism meant that during the pandemic people from ethnic minority backgrounds were at a disadvantage in their access to resources for prevention against and treatment and care for Covid-19.

For FEMHO's members, the pervasiveness of structural racism left them severely exposed and without proper support they desperately needed. Ade Adeyemi poignantly stated in his evidence that ethnic minority groups were left floundering within the NHS, desperately urging the powers that be to recognise and address the issues they face.

The questions that echo in FEHMO's collective consciousness are these: why didn't our leaders have measures in place to mitigate against the predictably harsher impact of a pandemic on black, Asian and minority ethnic people? Secondly, why were there disproportionate death rates amongst ethnic minority healthcare workers? Why was it paid so little attention in real time without appropriate strategic response from the government?

My Lady, this Inquiry has heard incontrovertible evidence of failures that marred the government's response to the pandemic. From FEHMO's point of view, it's a tale of incompetence, negligence and a tragic dance that has cost lives, a dance that cannot be ignored or forgotten. The government's emergency planning and pandemic resilience efforts should have anticipated that health inequalities, exacerbated by structural racism and broader issues like austerity, would have intensified vulnerabilities leading to disproportionate, adverse health outcomes for the BAME community and BAME healthcare workers.

This perspective aligns with the reality that certain ethnic and racial groups are at higher risk of susceptible to respiratory diseases. Moreover, the substantial representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic people at a higher risk of exposure due to increased likelihood of working -- and my Lady, get this -- in public-facing roles, being on the frontline, underscores the necessity for government decision-making to have incorporated focused considerations of race and ethnicity during the pandemic.

Don't forget, my Lady, and I'm going off script here, when the former Prime Minister gave his evidence the other Thursday, he said that they knew this very early on. That was his evidence.

Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said on Day 22 he unequivocally acknowledged the foreseeability of disparities in health outcomes, including death rates based on ethnicity. These disparities, rooted in pre-existing structural health inequalities, were deemed by him as matters of public health considerations, as distinct from political considerations. The clarity of Sir Patrick's evidence is to be preferred to the colour blind approach encouraged by the former Equalities Minister, Ms Kemi Badenoch. The so-called "colour blindness" is not a virtue. Instead, it's a dangerous denial. To reduce the risk for everyone while failing to acknowledge that, because of structural racism, some people are at higher risk, is not just a misstep, it's a refusal to confront the truth.

FEHMO particularly commends to you the evidence of Mayor Sadiq Khan, which highlights the failures in government decision-making in respect of black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. He told of the lack of understanding at the highest level, including Cabinet ministers, of the unique challenges faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic people. He stated the importance of understanding multigenerational households and the varying prevalence of diseases.

Mr Khan spoke of structural inequality and structural racism, revealing the systemic disparities that plagued our response to the pandemic. He also made observations about the need for representation at the highest levels, particularly noting the absence of black, Asian and minority ethnic voices within COBR meetings, where critical decisions were being made about the pandemic. He cited that an acuity with issues affecting black, Asian and minority ethnic communities within decision-making spaces might -- and I put it no higher than that -- might have made a difference in developing appropriate strategic responses.

The Inquiry was told about the failure to acknowledge ethnicity as a risk factor within the NHS, and FEHMO's Ade Adeyemi's evidence revealed that 64% of black, Asian and minority ethnic doctors were feeling pressured to work in settings with inadequate PPE compared to 33% of their white counterparts. Shockingly, my Lady, PPE was not even fit tested for individuals with religious headwear, exposing a dangerous failure in the government's duty to protect its frontline workers.

The disregard for essential information continues with ethnicity not being recorded on death certificates, and you heard some evidence in relation to that and submissions in relation to that yesterday afternoon. We say this omission perpetuates the invisibility of the true impact of health inequalities on ethnic minority communities, hindering effective policy responses. If you don't gather the data, you won't know how big a problem it is. It's as simple as that.

My Lady, do you remember the evidence about the plight of Filipino healthcare workers who feared the visa consequences if they refused to work in unsafe conditions that Mayor Khan was telling us about? This further exposures a lack of a clear messaging. Witness after witness lamented the absence of a proper functioning system of data collection. There was almost a complete blackout in data capture for black, Asian and minority ethnic communities during the early stages of the pandemic. And because of this absence there was a disaggregation based on race and ethnicity.

Computer modelling did not even include ethnicity because there was simply no capacity to do this work, both because of an absence of data and due to the fact that models could not be built to include ethnic considerations.

On the issue of messaging and communication, FEHMO is of the view that there was not just a flaw in government decision-making, there was a deadly barrier that perpetuated disparities faced by ethnic minority communities.

Professor Chris Whitty acknowledged in his evidence that Covid guidance only reached some ethnic minority people through the efforts of groups like FEHMO, and you'll remember how he praised the efforts of those who I represent in trying to get the message out. Rather than just being hard to reach, ethnic minority communities were failed by formal systems and instead had to rely on their own community leaders to pick up the slack, including the dissemination of essential information in community languages.

So let me come to some submissions which I hope may be of assistance to you when you retire to consider everything that you've heard.

Number one, senior decision-makers knew or ought to have known that in a pandemic there would be variability in outcome based on ethnicity. It was well known that structural health inequalities would have driven vulnerability within the -- I'm going to say BAME, I hate that word, but just because of time -- BAME communities. This is not an assertion of left wing politics, but it's a well appreciated understanding within public health. So that's number one.

Number two, pandemic pre-planning was catastrophically inadequate, and was characterised by, and note this, my Lady, successive governments' -- successive governments' -- lack of engagement, and the absence of strategic planning response to a foreseeable pandemic.

As Mr Cummings put it, vulnerable groups were "almost entirely appallingly neglected by the entire planning system". And he said that on Day 15.

Number three, Mr Johnson's government then flip-flopped, with lockdown only implemented at the eleventh hour, that being in March 2020, when there was an imminent risk of the NHS being overwhelmed. In the wasted months leading up to March, there was no measures in place to mitigate the predictable, harsh compact that the pandemic would have on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.

Four, there was no real-time response to the alarming disparity in death rates in the BAME communities. Dominic Raab, deputising for Mr Johnson, claimed that the phenomenon of disproportionate deaths was not understood within Number 10 or there was no consensus that reached the threshold for actionable policymaking. He said that on Day 28.

Nothing meaningful, my Lady, was done in terms of a strategic response because of this supposed uncertainty. The absence of any strategic response from government is made even more egregious when there was little or no evidence of an attempt to engage with black, Asian and minority ethnic healthcare leaders during those early, scary days of the pandemic. Some of the first risk assessments based on ethnicity were done by FEHMO's own membership, filling the void of government inaction.

Fifthly, FEHMO submits that the failure to anticipate and respond to disproportionate death rates was a failure of the government's duty to protect life enshrined by Article 2 of the ECHR and to protect health.

So let me come to my conclusions.

Then Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in characteristically unserious manner, referred to the strategic engagement with ethnic and faith groups around Covid as "all that jazz". But, my Lady, far beyond these idiosyncrasies of one individual leader, this jarring gallows-like humour was presented over deathly inaction that successive governments, culminating in Boris Johnson's government, exposed FEMHO's members to, by failing to properly plan for the pandemic of this kind. There was a clear failure to act.

This represented, we say, a dereliction of the government's duty to protect the life and health of black, Asian and minority ethnic healthcare workers and their communities during the early stages of the pandemic. We cannot afford to ignore these realities. We must confront the truth, acknowledge the existence of structural racism, and work collectively to dismantle the barriers that perpetuate inequality.

We say, my Lady, and we say it respectfully, the time for denial is over and this Inquiry should say so when spelling out what went wrong and why.

Audre Lorde said:

"It is not our differences that divide us. It is our inability to recognise, accept, and celebrate those differences."

You see, in recognising the structural inequalities that plague our society, we acknowledge the undeniable truth that unity arises not from uniformity but embracing the richness of our diversity.

Can I say something positive: we commend the Inquiry for undertaking the investigation of the role of structural inequalities and structural racism in the pandemic, and we submit that the evidence is clear that the disproportionalities experienced by the black, Asian and minority ethnic people were not only entirely foreseeable but were as a result of government failure to take proper action to anticipate and mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

I've got 40 seconds left. Let me use my 40 seconds saying this: in the powerful words of Ade Adeyemi, taken from his witness statement on behalf of FEHMO, we say this encapsulates the essence and impact of this stark conclusion:

"Throughout the course of this pandemic, the disheartening experience of minority ethnic [healthcare workers] have underscored the systemic oversights and lapses in our health and governance systems. The poignant accounts of our members, and the stark data supporting them, reflect not just individual tragedies, but an overarching narrative of neglect."

Thank you, my Lady.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Thomas.

Now I think it's Mr Sheldon.
