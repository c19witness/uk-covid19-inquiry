Questions From Lead Counsel to the Inquiry

**Mr Keith**: Could you give the Inquiry, please, your full name.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Mark Edward John Woolhouse.

**Lead Inquiry**: Professor, thank you for your assistance to the Inquiry. You've provided a 15-page statement dated 27 April 2023. Have you appended your signature to that statement and the statement of truth at its conclusion?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: Thank you very much.

Professor, you are by profession a professor of infectious disease epidemiology, you have a multitude of qualifications, you have worked as an academic researcher, you have worked in the field of infectious diseases and global health for many years, and you are an expert on the particular topic of emerging pathogens, which is of great interest to this Inquiry, of course. You're currently the principal investigator at the Epigroup, the Epidemiological Research Group, which enquires into novel emerging pathogens; is that correct?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: You have published more than 400 scientific papers on the issues of emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. You've advised governments and national and international agencies over the years.

Of even more central importance, during the United Kingdom response to Covid, were you a member for a time of SPI-M, that's the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I was.

**Lead Inquiry**: Did you attend a meeting of NERVTAG in December 2021?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I did.

**Lead Inquiry**: We've heard evidence from Dr Calderwood that there was, in April 2020, set up in Scotland the Scottish Covid-19 Advisory Group; were you a member of that also?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I was.

**Lead Inquiry**: You're a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and a number of other renowned institutions. You're also a published author because you wrote a book on the pandemic entitled The Year the World Went Mad.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I did.

**Lead Inquiry**: I'd like to start, please, with the issue of the United Kingdom's ranking in the Global Health Security Index. My Lady has heard evidence that in 2019 the United Kingdom was ranked with an overall score of second in the Global Health Security Index, which is a joint endeavour between a number of US and UK bodies.

Did that overall score reflect different or varying marks or outcomes in a range of areas such as prevention of the emergence of release of disease or rapid response and mitigation, various different aspects to how a country might respond to a pandemic?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It did, and the category "rapid response and mitigation of the spread of an epidemic" in that report was a separate category, obviously very relevant to the work of this Inquiry, and the UK scored highest in that category, by a considerable margin.

**Lead Inquiry**: So it was first in that category, "rapid response to and mitigation of the spread of an epidemic"?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: I think I may be permitted to suggest without much chance of contradiction that things didn't quite turn out in that regard as well as might be thought from that ranking.

Was that a failure in the ranking, or was -- is there or was there a danger that countries which do well in such international rankings may fall into the perennial trap of complacency, or failing to notice that doing well in rankings and in terms of preparedness doesn't necessarily mean that that particular country may not remain very vulnerable in certain areas of response to pandemic outbreaks?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I think that's a reasonable interpretation. The global health community, compares health responses across the world, is clearly very exercised about this lack of predictive power, not only actually of the Global Health Security Index but a number of other indices that relate, health systems, resilience and so on, and there has been a number of scientific papers published on exactly what you say, that -- the very poor relationship between the two. We've done work of our own on that in Africa, where a particular index was, again, an extremely poor predictor of actual outcomes during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The designers of those indices, which is on the face of it are pretty sensible, they have very sensible criteria, I think they were defended on the grounds they weren't intended to be predictive, in that very clear sense. But if they weren't, what are they for?

**Lead Inquiry**: I'm just going to pause you there, Professor, just because you're speaking quite fast and our excellent stenographer is obliged to keep up with you, as are we all. Could you just go a little bit slower, please.

So the question then arises: for what purpose are they produced if they are both, by turn, not particularly predictive and possibly causative of complacency or the taking of one's eye off the ball?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I agree, and, as I said, this is a question with which the global health community -- research community is very exercised at the moment.

**Lead Inquiry**: Since Covid-19, have any comparable international indices been published in which the United Kingdom has appeared?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I'm not sure if there was actually rankings done, I mean, there have been a number of studies of the pandemic response, but whether they've ranked them -- if you're thinking of a particular example, please ...

**Lead Inquiry**: No, I was just wondering whether or not post-Covid that such rankings may have had introduced into them a greater degree of reality?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No. Well, if they had I would say at the moment that is premature. I think we have to deconstruct what these rankings were and weren't telling us and understand that much better.

You put your finger on it, I think, when you asked me: is there some mix-up between preparedness or having the capacity, the health system capacity, to respond, and also actual vulnerability to any particular pandemic agent? And a very good example of this is one of the biggest risk factors for a severe Covid-19 pandemic around the world is having a more urbanised population. This virus spreads particularly well in cities. Well, that wasn't part of the pandemic preparedness indices. That's a marker of vulnerability.

Another marker of vulnerability would be having an ageing population. For Covid-19 that had enormous effects on the vulnerability of countries. So the UK was very vulnerable in that particular criteria. But that wasn't included in the pandemic preparedness indices.

So -- and I believe the ex CMO, Sally Davies, has already given evidence about the possible role of poor population health. So in the UK we have a number of population health problems, including obesity, and they have an impact.

So those are all about vulnerability, and the preparedness indices are trying to get some indicator of what our level of preparedness is, and clearly those two are not the same thing and when they combine, they combine in the unpredictable way that we saw in 2020.

**Lady Hallett**: Forgive me for interrupting, Mr Keith. Are there any examples of a country that gets a low ranking and then performed well?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, there are. A number of countries in Africa -- so we went over my qualifications. I'm actually director of a global health partnership that works in Africa, worked on pre-pandemic planning in Africa and also then, of course, during the pandemic as well. The point I just made to you there was about urbanisation, so by far the worst affected country in Africa was South Africa, which has by far the strongest health system. So countries with more outdoor lifestyles, more rural populations were actually much less affected.

That's, I think -- I believe that's true globally as well.

**Mr Keith**: So would it be fair to say that there are two core weaknesses or dangers associated with placing too great a reliance on any system of international reliability? Firstly, we are dealing here, are we not, with the field of pathogenic outbreaks, and certainly respiratory viruses but perhaps all pathogenic outbreaks are inherently unpredictable and, therefore, there is a degree -- a very distinct limit on how well one can predict outcomes.

Secondly, systems that focus about governmental and structural preparedness may fail to pay sufficient account to the vulnerability that any particular country may have within its system because of comorbidities and the like, and so on.

Are those two propositions fair?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, I think that's fair, and perhaps there wasn't enough awareness of just how important those vulnerabilities were, but with the very important caveat that the ones I listed just then were, because they were relevant to Covid-19, and of course if we did have a pandemic of a very different infectious nature -- infectious agent with a very different nature, very different problem that it presented, the vulnerabilities may be different vulnerabilities.

**Lead Inquiry**: Indeed.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: For example, the UK is not thought of as particularly vulnerable to a vector-borne disease outbreak.

**Lead Inquiry**: Just pause there, vector-borne, please?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Carried by biting insects or arthropods, so a mosquito-borne one like dengue --

**Lead Inquiry**: Or a flea or --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- good example. Could be, a flea or a tick. Ticks are also common. But -- sorry, I've lost my train of thought.

**Lady Hallett**: UK not vulnerable --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, so we're not thought to be vulnerable to something like Zika virus because we don't have enough of the right kind of mosquitoes to transmit that particular disease. So vulnerability is very, very context dependent, and what makes us vulnerable to Covid-19 may not make us vulnerable to other kinds of pandemic.

**Lead Inquiry**: On that theme, I now want to ask you about the degree to which the risk of non-influenza new and emerging pathogenic outbreaks was recognised pre-Covid.

Could we have INQ000149116, please.

This is a draft of a high level summary of a paper -- well, a paper called High Level Summary of Emerging Viral Threats to Human Health, prepared by yourself and colleagues and referenced to the University of Edinburgh in March 2015.

In this summary, Professor, you address the sources, the genesis of particular types of threats facing the United Kingdom, and you divide them up into threats from viruses which present either a clear and present danger, or are matters of concern, or where you felt there were gaps presumably in the systems in place in order to be able to identify those viruses and to respond to them.

On page 2, in the first category, "Clear and present danger", you said this:

"This category covers taxa containing viruses that are well-recognised public health threats and where (better) vaccines are needed."

Was it the purpose of this paper to identify the greatest threats and therefore also what may need to be done in order to better prepare ourselves for meeting those threats?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: The paper was prepared as part of the background documents for a meeting chaired by the then CMO, Sally Davies, for something called the UK -- what became, I think, out of that meeting, the UK Vaccine Network, so the aim was to identify what kind of threat the UK should be concerned with in terms of building the capacity to produce a vaccine. Work that's been carried on since in other forum as well. So that's the context --

**Lead Inquiry**: That was the reason why.

You identify three broad categories of virus: Filoviridae, which includes Ebola and the Marburg virus, they cause haemorrhagic fever; and then this second category, Coronaviridae, including the severe respiratory infections Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus -- we know it as 1, I suppose -- and MERS, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.

"We note that although there are not currently any vaccines available against human coronaviruses there are vaccines for animal coronaviruses ..."

Then a third category, which we needn't concern ourselves with for present purposes.

Were you, in essence, identifying that the broad genus of coronavirus viruses presented a clear and present danger and that, by implication, this was something that needed to be addressed in terms of response, vaccine response of course, but presumably generally?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That was our view then, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: To what extent was the risk or the danger presented by coronaviruses recognised at the international level, for example by the WHO and its prioritisation of diseases?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I didn't become involved in the WHO prioritisation exercises until two years later, in 2017.

**Lead Inquiry**: Is that the WHO Research and Development Blueprint exercise?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: We'll have a look at that, then, straightaway. INQ000149108.

Did the WHO, for our purposes in 2017 and 2018, produce an annual review of diseases which, in its opinion, were required to be prioritised because of the risk that they posed?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's correct. Specifically, the aim of this exercise, as I understood it, was to identify gaps in R&D, in research and development, and so clearly recognised threats such as influenza were not included in this exercise. They were felt by the WHO that this was already covered. So the exercise was quite deliberately to look beyond influenza and other established threats, such as HIV/AIDS, to those where there hadn't been enough attention from the research and development communities.

**Lead Inquiry**: Influenza or at least in the form in which it might strike the United Kingdom, can be met with antivirals. There is a well known brand, Tamiflu, antiviral, there are vaccines in place, are there not, for influenza and if a seasonal influenza comes around that an existing vaccine cannot address, it's not overly difficult to modify the vaccine in order to ensure that it's an appropriate vaccine for that new seasonal variety; is that all correct?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's all correct. I wouldn't want to leave you or the room with the impression that that doesn't mean influenza is not a danger.

**Lead Inquiry**: No, no, no. I think there has been plenty of evidence on that, Professor.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Okay.

**Lead Inquiry**: The point is, though, that influenza is a pathogenic -- well, it's a pathogen for which there is already in existence a well known and quite well travelled countermeasure in the form of antivirals and vaccines.

But for coronavirus, there was none; is that correct?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, too little would be the WHO's view, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: All right.

If we look at page 16, we can see that you were on the Prioritization Committee. You will see your name towards the bottom of that list, alphabetically.

If we go to page 2, we can see the aims of the annual review set out.

So in essence, I think this process had started around May 2015, a research and development blueprint was drawn up to try to reduce the time lag between the identification of nascent pathogenic outbreaks and the approval that might be given to an antiviral or vaccine or some countermeasure.

An interim list was drawn up, and then in 2017 that original list was triaged or reduced so that you could produce a list of those viruses which really did present the greatest concern in this way.

Is that a correct summary?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It is, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: So we can see that in the middle of the page, this summary:

"The 2017 annual review determined there was an urgent need for research and development for:

"- ...haemorrhagic fevers ...

"- Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever ...

"- Filoviral diseases ...

"- Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ..."

There is our old friend MERS.

"- Other highly pathogenic coronaviral diseases (such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, (SARS) ..."

Then references to the well known diseases of Nipah, Rift, SFTS and Zika.

Is this the position, then, that this senior and august body and its committee, of which you were a member, was identifying that because of the risk posed by coronaviral diseases generally, so not just MERS and SARS, there was an urgent need for research and development?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yep, that was the conclusion of the committee, yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: If we go to page 13, we can see then the final report, if you like, or the determination of the committee, the list of diseases is then set out, and in addition some of the thinking and some of the discussion about why some diseases have made it on to that list and why others had not.

May we take it, then, Professor, from the fact that this prioritisation committee had identified coronaviral diseases as presenting the threat that it does, that there was a general acknowledgement in the scientific world, perhaps not yet politically but certainly in the scientific world, of the threat posed by coronaviral diseases?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, that's right, and you made the point of the contrast with influenza at the beginning.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was the position the same the following year in 2018, do you recall? Were MERS and SARS and, by then, something called Disease X on the list?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I wasn't a member of the same committee in 2018. I only sat on it in January 2017. Yes, they still had MERS and SARS, as I recall. They'd actually combined them into one category of the severe coronaviruses. They had at that stage added the category Disease X, although it also emerged from this 2017 meeting, and I remember it very well. It's there at the bottom of the piece of paper we have in front of us now:

"In addition to any disease identified by the Blueprint's decision instrument for new diseases."

That was taken by the WHO and developed into Disease X concept, and that actually, I believe, appeared on their website as early as March 2017 as Disease X, and we had a lot of discussions in the room in 2017 about the concept of Disease X without actually attaching that label to it.

**Lead Inquiry**: What is the concept of Disease X? My Lady heard evidence from Professor Whitworth and Dr Hammer on why this concept, Disease X, has utility and why it has come to light and why it's being pursued.

Is it in essence emblematic or reflective of the need to make sure that we never take our eye off the existence or the possible existence of a hypothetical disease that will take us all by surprise? It may not necessarily be zoonotic, it could be a different type of disease, but we need always to be aware of the need to focus upon that possibility?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, I think the wording in the report of the 2018 committee is slightly different from the one you used just now, but it is there as a marker to acknowledge that the next pandemic might be caused by a pathogenic agent that we are not currently aware of, in other words something new.

It's a very simple concept, obviously, but we felt it was important that it was explicitly recognised, so that the -- and remember, this is targeted at the research and development community, so it's a marker that the research and development community did not forget to think about: what do we do if it's an unknown pathogen? What if it's something we haven't encountered before? What are the R&D requirements in that scenario?

**Lead Inquiry**: May Disease X be either a wholly unknown pathogen or may it be an existing pathogen but with variant characteristics, so a known disease but with significantly different characteristics?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, that's a little bit of a nuanced point. So you could take that from new strains of seasonal influenza which we get every year, so those are new, but generally we're able to handle those, to something completely out of the blue. The example I give on that is variant CJD, which is the causative agent of Mad Cow Disease, which was a very worrying pandemic -- or epidemic in the UK, fortunately a small one, in the mid-1990s. That was completely unanticipated, that -- well, not completely, there were one or two scientists who had been working on those sorts of agents, but it was very surprising to the majority of us.

Whereas something like, for example, a new strain of coronavirus would not be a complete surprise but it would be new. Again, the point of this exercise is it might need significant R&D attention as to how you would deal with something like that if it did arise.

**Lead Inquiry**: It is self-evident that the prioritisation committee were thinking about the possibility of a novel pathogenic outbreak, a new disease, and by implication expressing concern about that possibility in a way that governments perhaps were not. The structural, the preparedness, the governmental paperwork which has been adduced before my Lady shows that at that same time there was not the same degree of attention being paid to non-influenza pandemics. Why was that, do you think?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's a very big question.

So there was -- undoubtedly you're correct, there was a focus on influenza in terms of thinking about pandemic threats and preparedness for them, but also again, as highlighted in this, the research being done on infectious agents, you could argue that was also very focused on influenza.

I can give you an analogy, possibly, if you would like a horseracing analogy, but the situation is this: if you're deciding whether to invest your budget and bet on a single horse running in the Grand National and you brought a committee of horseracing experts together to decide which one you should put your money on, they would pretty likely end up with the favourite, they would say put your money on the favourite, and there is no question at the time that pandemic influenza was the favourite.

The problem with that, it sounds a very rational strategy, but the problem is there's an awful lot of horses in the Grand National, and the chance of the favourite winning is actually quite small. 4 to 1 would be very, very short odds for the favourite for a Grand National. But the chance of the horse winning with the 4 to 1 odds is only 20%. If you bet on the favourite, you are very likely to lose your money. I think that's a fair analogy to how we were viewing threats, pandemic threats at the time.

**Lead Inquiry**: The sheer number of riders and racers in the Grand National is reflective of the inherent unpredictability of pathogenic outcomes and viruses, and it is folly to assume a given outcome?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. But if you'd asked me at that time, at that stage, which was the favourite in the race, I would have said pandemic influenza, but I would not and did not at the time favour putting all my money on that one bet. The correct strategy, in my view, is to hedge your bets.

**Lead Inquiry**: An each way bet on other possible finishers.

At the same time as this thinking was going on, the MERS and SARS epidemics had taken place --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Lead Inquiry**: -- and particularly so in the Far East.

At INQ00018793 there is an article entitled Lessons learned from SARS: The experience of the Health Protection Agency, England, dated -- if we go forward one page -- 16 November 2005.

If we could go to page 5, I should say that this report reports on the experiences of what was then the Health Protection Agency in England on how the United Kingdom had coped with the limited way in which SARS had impacted, relatively speaking, upon the United Kingdom.

If you could scroll back out, please, the last paragraph in the section headed "Surge capacity within the HPA", so the right-hand side, the right-hand column, thank you:

"There is currently limited surge capacity to respond to an incident such as SARS that requires a large team over a prolonged period of time to prevent fatigue and potential burn-out of key staff involved in the response."

Then if we could go to page 6 the last paragraph refers to:

"Data from countries with substantial outbreaks ..."

So the bottom right-hand corner, thank you.

"... demonstrated that basic public health and infection control measures such as contact tracing, infection control procedures, quarantine and voluntary home isolation were effective in controlling the outbreaks in the absence of a rapid diagnostic test, a vaccine or effective treatment. The outbreak highlighted that all levels of the healthcare system in the UK need to be prepared to respond; especially as the level of threat remains ever present ..."

Then, of course, there is the reference to the possibility of there being further influenza outbreaks and the "potential emergence of a strain of the ... virus with pandemic potential".

Then there is another reference the following page to the need to respond to any large outbreak by way of substantial surge capacity.

So it is obvious that in the scientific world and the academic world, and perhaps to some extent in the political world, there was a recognition by the years after SARS, so 2005, that a future pathogenic outbreak with severe potential, a pandemic, would require surge capacity to deal with the sheer numbers and also to deal with the fact that the inherent unpredictability of the characteristics of a pandemic or the virus meant that having a surge capacity in place was part of the necessary -- would be part of the necessary countermeasures.

Why do you think that national governments did not expand their surge capacity to deal with the possibility of a novel or a new emerging pathogen? Would it have been for budgetary reasons only or do you think there wasn't a sufficient understanding of the risk?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I can't answer that question for government and say what their thinking on it was. I can give you a little bit more context.

**Lead Inquiry**: Please.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So SARS was a very worrying incipient pandemic, but through what was essentially outbreak control in the affected countries, it was brought under control, and in the end the virus was actually eradicated, it was not continued. So it didn't actually develop into what we would now call a pandemic.

Scientists at the time were very clear that it had a good potential to do that, so it was an extraordinary success story, led particularly by the World Health Organisation, to bring that potential pandemic not only under control but actually to eliminate the virus, but it never actually developed into a wide-scale population problem of the sort that we would see, say, we'd expect to see with influenza.

And MERS was the same, MERS was never -- it has produced lots of outbreaks and very concerning ones, but it's not gone into community transmission, it's not spread through whole populations.

So I think even despite experience of SARS, there was probably a little bit of thinking that this was still a theoretical possibility. In the event, SARS didn't start major epidemics.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was that because of the lower rates of transmission as opposed to the fact that certain countries had been well placed to bring it under control and did so?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I'm not sure how well placed other countries were to respond to SARS. So the SARS outbreak was 2003, and it was new, it was the first severe coronavirus. We knew of other human coronaviruses, they have been around a long time, but they cause colds, basically. So SARS was the first severe one, so I can't say how countries such as China, who are at the epicentre of the outbreak, how well prepared they felt they were for it, but they responded well, and the way they responded to SARS was by this rapid detection of cases and the isolation of cases and in some cases their -- in some instances their contacts, and this was sufficient to bring that particular -- those particular set of outbreaks under control. Coupled -- I should, because this is important -- with very rigorous infection control in healthcare settings, because both SARS and MERS have a propensity to spread within healthcare settings. So they were able to bring it under control and did so, as I say, remarkably effectively.

**Lead Inquiry**: There were in the United Kingdom a number of exercises between 2015 and 2018 concerned with testing our capabilities to deal with high-consequence infectious diseases. So there was an Ebola surge capacity exercise, a coronavirus-related exercise, Exercise Valverde, the MERS exercise which you'll recall, Exercise Alice, and then, more recently, an HCID related exercise called Exercise Broad Street.

All those exercises, though, focused, did they not, upon HCIDs? Were HCIDs generally regarded, as perhaps the name identifies, as being high consequence, so very high levels of fatality, high-consequence diseases, but diseases which would be associated with limited spread, perhaps confined to healthcare settings, :outline:`close contacts`, patients and the like, and not susceptible to widespread transmission such as influenza or, as we now know, Covid?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I'm not familiar with all the exercises you listed there, but I'm familiar with some, and I would absolutely support the strategy of conducting exercises that look at high-consequence infectious disease outbreaks, so ones that don't generate into full-blown epidemics. I mean, that's clearly something that government should be doing and was doing.

The question then is whether or not people should have been looking also at the possibility that these would move beyond outbreaks into major epidemics that would affect the community.

Now, this isn't a report of one of the exercises, but I think it comes out of it, so some of the risk assessments on SARS, one of the papers you gave me, is very clear that they do have a scenario there, they have the scenario you described, where there's a major outbreak but it is containable, the exercise is about containing it, but they do also allow the possibility of a community-wide outbreak. So that is recognised within the risk assessment, but whether it was explored as an exercise I have no knowledge of that myself.

**Lead Inquiry**: But at the same time the risk assessment process divided up, by way of pigeon-holing these pathogenic outbreaks, the diseases into two categories. You had influenza pandemic, which is of course regarded as a mass event, and then, by contrast, new emerging disease, which was assumed to be confined to healthcare settings, to have a small number of casualties, in the tens or hundreds, and then casualties, those who are falling sick, in the thousands.

But there was no middle ground, it was either influenza pandemic with massive widespread transmission and pandemic potential, with hundreds of thousands of deaths, or very limited low number of deaths, HCID. There was no consideration given as a separate category to an HCID or a pathogen, a novel pathogen, with widespread potential, pandemic potential.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I agree, that is how it looks.

**Lead Inquiry**: Were you aware, was the scientific community aware of that approach being adopted in the risk assessment process at the time and also in what is now known to be the 2011 UK strategy on pandemic influenza?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Were we aware, sorry?

**Lead Inquiry**: Were you aware of that approach being adopted and applied in the government's strategic approach, its pandemic planning, or in the risk assessment procedures which the government applied?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So, yes, but there are different phases here. So in the immediate aftermath of 2003/4, when the SARS epidemic, let's describe it as, happened there was a lot of thinking about SARS-like events. But then there was the swine flu pandemic of 2009/2010, and that reignited interest in influenza pandemic. So we tend to be rather reactive, I think, in our thinking.

**Lead Inquiry**: Does it follow from the fact that that 2011 strategy was concerned only with pandemic influenza that aspects of that strategic approach were going to be inappropriate and ineffective for a coronavirus?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Well, we all know that to be the case now, and I would say yes, it was visible at the time, if anyone was looking at it through that particular lens, but it was, and it says so at the top of the document, a pandemic influenza preparedness plan and not a pandemic preparedness plan, and I would regard those as different things. The pandemic -- the influenza pandemic preparedness plan has not been fully tested yet, thank goodness, so we wouldn't know. But we weren't -- what's the phrase? We'd done our homework but it turned out we'd prepared for the wrong exam.

**Lead Inquiry**: Was it generally understood or was the scientific community conscious that there was, relatively speaking, very little debate in governmental terms of, flowing from the risk of differences in incubation period, differences in levels of transmission, differences in the R0 number, differences in the type of infection, whether it might be asymptomatic or symptomatic, that there was no widespread debate about what possible countermeasures could be devised, thought of, debated and analysed to meet a different type of pandemic outbreak, so no debate of the countermeasures of mass contact tracing, mass diagnostic testing, the impact upon schools of long-term closures, the impact upon marginalised sectors of society, the impact of mandatory quarantining? That debate in a general sense doesn't appear ever to have taken place pre-Covid.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Again, those two phases, the post SARS phase and the post swine flu phase, are relevant. In the academic and the research communities there was always a tremendous amount of interest and work on the best ways that we might come up with to control those particular challenges, but scientists are like everyone else, we also follow what happens, so we were focusing a lot on SARS-like ones in the early 2000s and then shifted more to pandemic influenza later. But not exclusively so, there was still work on that. So there's a lot of research going on about what the right ways are to respond to these different types of threat, and, as you explored with me at the beginning of this, there was also some talk about the diversity of threats, what those other types of threats might look like. But it was always apparent to me, and I'm sure to many other colleagues at the time, that by the time it got into government and Department of Health and ... influenza had somehow risen to the top again, and a lot of this other work, sort of supporting work for other types of threat, got less attention and didn't appear, as you quite rightly say, in the plans that were written in that period.

**Lead Inquiry**: I think my Lady heard from a witness a couple of weeks ago who observed that it's a necessary part -- or it's an unintended consequence, perhaps, from governance and from systems of government that officials and politicians like to be able to have a piece of paper that identifies the problem and the answer, and therefore there was a tendency to say, "We have correctly identified the greatest threat as pandemic influenza, we can focus on that", and because other threats are lesser in form they just tended to slip out of the side?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I think that's exactly right, and I have experience going back over 20 years working as an adviser to various government departments and agencies, and yes, I would say that was fair. Once the main threat had been identified, that became the priority.

Again, this is maybe a job for the Inquiry, but we had a pandemic influenza preparedness plan, and even if it was, by the time the pandemic arrived, nine years old, but we had it, but it would have been an awful lot of work by an awful lot of people to prepare pandemic preparedness plans for a SARS-like pandemic, that we're just describing, or a haemorrhagic fever threat, or a vector-borne, that is the mosquito-transmitted threat, or a food-borne threat like Mad Cow Disease. It would have been an awful lot of effort for the relevant government departments to prepare for all those separately.

**Lead Inquiry**: But a lot of lives potentially saved, of course?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: As you say, an important exercise.

**Lead Inquiry**: Are you aware that following the pandemic the Royal Academy of Engineering reported upon the risk assessment process operated by the United Kingdom Government and identified that there had been too great a focus on pandemic influenza and reported that there had to be a wider consideration of the range of possible scenarios which might ensue?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, I am, and my understanding is that is now being built into current cross-government risk assessments, but I haven't seen a final draft of that assessment yet.

**Lead Inquiry**: One separate but related point, in the scientific world there was therefore, we can see from your evidence, extensive debate about possible countermeasures that could be relied upon to meet the particular range of scenarios which might emerge. Was there extensive debate at academic and scientific level of the benefits of :outline:`wearing masks`? Putting aside whether or not they did prove to have significant benefit, was there nevertheless a debate taking place about the degree of benefit pre-Covid?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I am aware of that issue being discussed. It wasn't one that I had personally got particularly involved in, but it has long been an issue as to whether :outline:`masks` are effective or not effective and that has been discussed in scientific and health circles for many years now.

**Lead Inquiry**: A separate topic, please, Professor, data collection.

In March of 2017 you started engaging in a course of correspondence with the then Chief Medical Officer of Scotland, Dr Catherine Calderwood, from whom my Lady heard this morning, about the problems that you had encountered in getting access to data to allow you to carry out a study that you were then engaged in.

With your vast experience, is there anything that you would like to say about the inherent or strategic difficulties placed in the way of efficient data gathering across nations, in your case Scotland? Pre-Covid, was the system of data gathering for the purposes of research and healthcare an efficient one?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It was not, but again, just to slightly correct the context, we're not talking about the actual gathering of data here -- although there may be issues connected with that too --

**Lead Inquiry**: It was the access?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- we're talking about the access to that, in this particular context that you raised, for health research purposes, and the procedures for accessing data in Scotland had become so extraordinarily onerous that in what I would have thought was a fairly standard, routine, non-demanding research project that used anonymised data, so there was no risk of patient confidentiality or anything, the process of accessing those data took over a year, hundreds of person hours, and was the main job that one of my graduate students assigned to this particular project did for the whole year.

We got access to the data finally, but only because our colleagues in the various aspects of the process that were required to deliver the data were extraordinarily helpful and were working with us. But it was extremely onerous, and I have made the decision now, and I stick by it, that I will not put graduate students on that kind of research again in Scotland until this is fixed. It's just far, far too onerous.

Presumably one of the things you're referring to in that email correspondence is I wrote that I was very concerned about the implications of having such an onerous data access system in the event of an emergency like an influenza pandemic.

**Lead Inquiry**: You said:

"There is a compelling case that Scottish lives are being put at risk because research that needs to be done is not being done ... I dread to think of the consequences if we ever find ourselves facing a health emergency such as pandemic influenza."

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: That's correct.

**Lead Inquiry**: You called upon Dr Calderwood to assist and the email correspondence shows that she responded to you offering to lend her support and inviting you to contact I think some particular officials who she thought might break the logjam.

Was this the position, that it appeared to you that there was too great a weight placed upon privacy rights and, in the balance between proper medical research and data protection, the balance was out of kilter?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Completely out of kilter. The hurdles put before us in the interests of data protection were, in my view, entirely disproportionate and were a serious impediment to getting potentially life-saving research done.

**Lead Inquiry**: Are you able to say whether or not post-Covid there has been an improvement in that balance and whether or not access to proper data for the purposes of serious research is now easier?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It became easier during Covid. I realise that's not the phase you're talking about. I think it remains to be seen what the legacy of that is. I have in the past experienced this exact problem. I advised the then chief scientist, Sir David King, on the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak of 2001, advising him directly, and we had exactly the same issues there, that he wanted -- you know, this particular problem, he wanted mathematical models of how that epidemic might develop. We couldn't provide them at the time because we didn't have key data we needed from what was then the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, because of alleged data confidentiality issues. During the pandemic -- epidemic, foot-and-mouth epidemic, once it had started, data we had been seeking for several years suddenly arrived on my desk.

So during an emergency, things change. And what became -- what were barriers there -- but it would have been much more useful then to have had the data in advance, we would have been months ahead, and it would have been much more useful in the Covid pandemic to have all these arrangements sorted out in advance because we would have been months ahead.

So we were left in the position of having to deal with these data access issues in the face of a pandemic.

**Lady Hallett**: And are the issues the same for data access around the United Kingdom? You're talking about what happened to you in Scotland.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: No, I think they're not exactly the same, the procedures are not exactly the same, but I suspect many of my colleagues in England would share my views that this is not an easy logjam to break, as Mr Keith put it.

**Lady Hallett**: All right.

**Mr Keith**: I think the Data Protection Act and the GDPR apply across the United Kingdom, but --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, but the processes --

**Lead Inquiry**: -- the processes for accessing data in Scotland ...

During the pandemic in fact -- well, my Lady's heard evidence that there were a number of remarkable surveys and data-driven projects put into place, from the ZOE project, Vivaldi, the Covid-19 survey and so on. There was one in Edinburgh, the EAVE data analysis project, which I think was able to secure access to data from general practitioners in healthcare settings relating, obviously anonymously, to over 5 million people in the population for the purposes of carrying out modelling and research and the like.

So is the lesson, if there is a lesson to be drawn from this, Professor, that we cannot allow ourselves to slip back? Having, under the exigencies of the emergency, been able to access such data to save lives, we must make sure that for research purposes data access is allowed to continue?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So I think there were actually two lessons --

**Lead Inquiry**: Please.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- one might draw from that. So first of all the EAVE project was led by my colleague Sir Aziz Sheikh at the University of Edinburgh, and a very dedicated team that worked extraordinarily hard on it. It produced some tremendously important information very quickly, for the reason you suggested, because we were able to access health records and link health records, which is crucial. The linkage of health data is particularly difficult, particularly onerous in terms of data protection.

But we were able to do it, and that provided invaluable information very quickly on the efficacy of vaccines shortly after the mass vaccination programme began and also on the severity of the different variants of Covid. So this was extraordinarily important information, and the team did remarkable work on this.

But they didn't produce their first outputs until June 2020. If we'd had that in place in January, February and March 2020, we could well have produced extremely valuable data that would have informed the early response. But we didn't have it in place, and one of the reasons we didn't have it in place is we didn't have the permissions set up.

There are other reasons too, I wouldn't say that was the only one. So that's absolutely one lesson: you need all this -- sorry, I beg your pardon -- we need all this in place in advance.

The second lesson is, as I've just explained, EAVE wasn't in place ready to go in place in January 2020, it had to be set up, and the set-up included all these data access protocols that had to be -- that took months to work our way through. But it wasn't set up, nor were some of the other ones you mentioned, nor was Zoe, nor was QCovid, nor was COG-UK, the genome wide ... all of these things, and there's many other initiatives -- CoMix, you mentioned CoMix -- all of these had a tremendous impact, positive impact, on how we managed the pandemic. None of them were set up in advance. We would have been so much further forward if they had been.

If I may add one further level to this story, we, in the Royal Society of Edinburgh, which you mentioned I'm a fellow of, we produced a report saying how important it was to have this sort of data collection systems, the data pipelines, the information flows, the permissions set up in advance, but we put this in a report that was published in the wake of the swine flu pandemic, and these things weren't done, and so it was a cause of great frustration to me and many other colleagues, including in EAVE, that we were reliving, in a way, the frustrations we'd had ten years before, almost ten years before, and we were going through this again. They hadn't been set up in advance.

**Lead Inquiry**: During that time you had been lone voices in the wilderness, I expect?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: In terms of the need for data during pandemics, I would say not, but -- I would say there was a small chorus of voices, but they weren't heard. Data protection had complete sway over this. That was the priority at the time and not access to researchers or to research programmes that might turn out to be useful if there was a pandemic. That was very, very low, I think, on the list of priorities people had. But as you say, I did object to that prioritisation in writing to the then Chief Medical Officer of Scotland.

**Lead Inquiry**: Three final topics, please, briefly, Professor.

Firstly, you are now a member of the Standing Committee on Pandemic Preparedness, the body in Scotland set up by the Scottish Government, about which my Lady heard evidence from Caroline Lamb, the Director General for Health and Social Care in Scotland, and from Dr Calderwood, the former Chief Medical Officer.

Does the existence of such a body on -- a Standing Committee on Pandemic Preparedness mean that, at least insofar as Scotland is concerned, there is less risk of a loss in institutional memory? That is to say if there is a body with political clout able to keep the pot boiling, then the learning, the incredibly valuable understanding and knowledge which has been gained as a result of having to deal with a pandemic is less likely to be lost; would you agree?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I think that's exactly right, and my understanding is that's one of the primary purposes of the committee.

**Lead Inquiry**: Secondly, you call in your witness statement for further focus to be paid on the less notable or perhaps the less well known disciplines of epidemiology, clinical medicine, diagnostic medicine and public health research, as opposed to other perhaps more famous areas, genomic testing perhaps. What did you mean by that? Why is there a need for greater focus on those areas of medicine?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I think this is a tremendously important point for the scientific community, the health research community, to bear in mind. During the pandemic and since the pandemic, there has been quite rightly tremendous focus on the technological innovations, particularly, for example, the development of vaccines, and greater claim to the underpinning science, the science of -- decades of science that underpin that, and that is, as you well know, an extraordinary success story that we should all celebrate, so I'm in no way putting that to one side. But for the first year of the pandemic, slightly less -- mass vaccination in the UK started on, I think it was, December 8, 2020, remarkably fast, quite extraordinary. But up to that point, other than trials, the vaccines had not saved a single life. They weren't there, we didn't have them. So what saved lives were those disciplines you just listed, the much less glamorous and well funded and well regarded disciplines of patient care, epidemiology, working out what public health interventions work. They haven't, I think, received the same attention, they haven't been put on a pedestal to the level that -- quite rightly -- the vaccine development has been, and we will need them next time.

There is, as you're well aware, a very ambitious -- but ambition is good -- but a very ambitious plan from the G7 to deliver a vaccine within 100 days of a public health emergency being declared, and that's fine, but while we're waiting for the vaccine, we will need to control the next pandemic in other ways, and that will require knowledge from the disciplines that I've just mentioned; and it's not just 100 days, because after the roll-out started in the UK of the vaccine, that was not the end of the UK's pandemic. More than half the people who died in the UK died of Covid after the vaccination programme began.

It takes time to roll out a vaccination programme, and when you learn during that process that you actually need two doses or more, it takes more time and, while that is happening and the vaccine has yet to do its work, we're going to need all those inputs, and I really hope that is not lost in -- not just by this Inquiry but by the scientific and health communities as a whole; that we recognise we are going to need them next time.

**Lead Inquiry**: And the government?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: And the government.

**Lead Inquiry**: Finally this: a number of your colleagues in the scientific world and professional world of medicine and epidemiology have said, have observed: don't be fooled into thinking that the next pandemic will be like the last one. What could the next pandemic be? Will it necessarily be a coronaviral pandemic, or something else?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: There are many different candidates. In the document you referred to early on we identified 22 categories of virus that we -- 22 -- were concerned about that were potential threats. The ones we've talked about in the hearing today include not only SARS-like ones but Ebola, Zika, BSE or Mad Cow Disease, these are very, very, very different threats. And a preparedness plan that prepares you for another SARS-like event will not prepare you for another Mad Cow Disease-like event or any stretch of the imagination. There may be some commonalities, but they are very, very different. So one obvious lesson is: don't just prepare for the pandemic you've just had.

And the other point I would make, and I hope this doesn't sound too shocking, but it's: on the scale of potential pandemics, Covid-19 was not at the top and it was possibly quite far from the top. It may be that next time -- and there will be a next time, I don't know when, it may be quite some time in the future, but I don't know when -- but there will be a next time, and it's possible that next time we are dealing with a virus that is much more deadly and is also much more transmissible, in which case actually the things we did to control Covid-19 wouldn't have worked anyway, at least not without society completely falling apart.

Now, I'm not sitting here as a doom-monger saying "This is going to happen" or "This is going to happen soon", but I am confident enough to tell government that this is something you should be concerned about, you should be prepared for. The next pandemic could be far more difficult to handle than Covid-19 was, and we all saw the damage that that pandemic caused us.

**Mr Keith**: Thank you, Professor.

My Lady, you have granted permission to Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice United Kingdom to ask some questions on the Scottish Government's Standing Committee on Pandemic Preparedness, the body to which the professor has already referred.

**Lady Hallett**: Mr Weatherby.

Questions From Mr Weatherby KC

**Mr Weatherby**: Thank you very much.

Just a very few questions from me, Professor, and as Mr Keith has said I'm asking questions on behalf of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice United Kingdom.

I just want to ask you a small number of questions about the SCoPP, the Standing Committee on Pandemic Preparedness in Scotland, of which you're a member.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Am I right that the standing committee, the nature of a standing committee is that it sits regularly?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, we met a number of times.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I mean, it's not just every month or something, we have met many --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: But it's meant to be there permanently and going on into the future; is that right?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, that's my understanding.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Its purpose is to maintain an overview of pandemic preparedness from the view of the scientist or from a technical point of view, and to co-ordinate the scientific advice on relevant issues and identify gaps in advice to government; is that right?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: And it's primarily positioned to advise the Scottish Government --

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: -- on pandemic preparedness?

This is an approach that is post pandemic, isn't it, or brought in during the pandemic?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: It's post pandemic, yes.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes, and is this a new approach to address the gap that I think you've identified in relation to the fact that scientists have been for some years, particularly yourself, talking about the hedging of bets, whereas governments have been focused -- or the United Kingdom Government has been focused on the backing the favourite model? Is a primary role of the SCoPP to try to bridge that gap?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: I don't know if I can accurately describe it as a primary role, but certainly, yes --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- pandemic intelligence is one of our roles, yes.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes, okay.

I think that SCoPP has already identified four key themes: the need for a centre of pandemic preparedness; data gathering and analysis to be considered as part of national infrastructure, and you've spoken a lot about that; the need to strengthen scientific advice and structures and engagement with citizens; and the fourth one, the need for collaboration within the UK and collaboration between the UK and global institutions for innovation and preparedness?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes, those four priority areas were arrived at after a number of consultations within the committee, and actually some beyond as well, but that's where we've arrived at.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: That's very helpful.

Finally this: in the committee's terms of reference, the committee is asked to respond to commissions from the Scottish Government, questions essentially from the Scottish Government, and to address things that have arisen there. But the terms of reference expressly indicate that SCoPP should address other issues of its own initiative where it feels necessary, so scientific autonomy. Yes?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Is that a very important feature for a body like SCoPP?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Thank you very much for that question. Yes, I think it is. The advisory groups that I have been on over many years for many different government departments, and also working with some in Scotland, have tended to be reactive. We haven't had that autonomy --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- to bring topics of concern to the table. I mean, informally, of course, they were a vehicle for doing so, but it's not been in the terms of reference of other advisory committees --

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: -- I've sat on, and I'm very happy that it is in the terms of reference.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes, and perhaps a lesson for others?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: And this autonomy brings a diversity of input, it guards against groupthink, and it involves a challenge to orthodoxy and innovation of scientific advice; is that right?

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: Yes. I mean, one way I like to put it, you know, when you're a scientist or adviser in that role, is you can't trust government to ask the right questions.

**Mr Weatherby KC**: Yes.

**Professor Mark Woolhouse**: So that's hopefully going to enable the right questions to be asked in the future.

**Mr Weatherby**: Professor, thank you very much.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you, Mr Weatherby.

Thank you very much, Professor Woolhouse. You've finished my professorial day. Thank you very much for your help, it's been extremely interesting and helpful. Thank you.

**The Witness**: Thank you very much.

**Mr Keith**: My Lady, that concludes the evidence for today.

**Lady Hallett**: 10 o'clock tomorrow, please.
