2. Submissions on Behalf of the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice by Mr Wilcock KC
========================================================================================================

**Mr Wilcock**: My Lady, as you've just been told, I represent the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Campaign.

Your Ladyship is, we know, very aware of the importance that those whom I represent place on this module of your Inquiry, particularly given the ongoing political stalemate in Northern Ireland and the fact that a Northern Irish-specific inquiry to provide scrutiny of the actions of the Stormont Assembly during the pandemic is seemingly little closer to reality than it was at the last time you had a preliminary hearing in this module, just under nine months ago.

As we have made clear in our written submissions, we note the indication from the Inquiry that this Module 2C is coequal to 2A and 2B, and that insofar as possible and appropriate M2C will pick up issues relating to communication with the Northern Ireland Executive civil service where M2 left off.

Can I just start off my response by acknowledging the hard work and effort that your team have put into ensuring that this module can start as planned in April next year, which of course is something those who I represent are particularly anxious takes place.

We're also conscious of the efforts they have made to ensure the timely provision of disclosure to all core participants, and their recent meetings with us, with the promise of more to come, to support our clients' engagement with the module and discuss ongoing matters before the final hearings, and we are grateful for those efforts, and they bode well for the co-operation that is to follow.

We also acknowledge that in at least two areas the Inquiry has taken into account representations that we have made in previous preliminary hearings, and thus we welcome the instruction of Professors O'Connor and Gray to provide what your counsel has described as the overarching constitutional arrangements which provides for the government of Northern Ireland, as well as an explanation of how the power-sharing structures work in theory and in practice.

Could we just ask that in considering these issues and the arrangements which were made in Northern Ireland for responding to the pandemic, those experts be asked to give some explicit thought to the relationships between Belfast, Westminster and Dublin. It may well be it's inherent in what we have been told, but can we just ask, in case it isn't, that some explicit thought be given to that when they produce their reports.

We note that these reports are expected, I think, by the end of January, and that Professor Gray has been asked to provide evidence setting out the health inequalities that were evident in Northern Ireland at the time of the outbreak of the pandemic, which is a matter your Ladyship knows is of utmost concern to those whom I represent.

Then finally, we are grateful that at least some of the issues we have previously flagged up have been acknowledged in the revised and finalised indicative list of issues, and it is ambitious and we're grateful for that ambition, and we also note that, in spite of its ambition, it explicitly states that it will be kept under review to perhaps be even more ambitious in the future, and no doubt you won't be surprised that we would seek to make representations if they are required.

We welcome your team's update on the wide range of Rule 9 requests that have been made, and particularly those that have been made following representations we have previously made to Robin Swann, Sue Gray and Brandon Lewis in particular.

In relation to the latter, can I draw your attention to the potential for his evidence to fill the gaps in the issue that we have set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 of our written note. My Lady, it will be a theme of my oral representations to you that I'm not going to repeat what is already in front of you in writing simply for the sake of it, in the knowledge that I know that having drawn your attention to it your Ladyship will of course read that note.

However, that said, those that I represent share the Inquiry's concern that, although we don't seek to either, one, minimise the -- I think it's rightly called -- vast amount of work required or, two, the efforts of those involved, or, three, the practical and financial challenges presented by the lack of a functioning government in Northern Ireland, we do share your team's concern as just expressed that the Inquiry's process is not disrupted by Rule 9 requests not being complied with as fully and expeditiously as is obviously required and should be possible.

Ms Dobbin has already stated that the fact that we are the last module in this phase of the Inquiry may of course help by giving us a little extra time, but given the individuals and departments have been on notice of what is required of them in this module for a considerable time, we urge them to provide all outstanding material as a matter of urgency so that there isn't an onslaught, as it were, of outstanding material and disclosure at the 12th hour, precluding the effective and adequate consideration that my clients are yearning for in the absence that I've previously described.

To that end we are grateful for my learned friend's comments that they are closely and your team is closely monitoring the compliance of the provision of witness statements with the questions actually asked and obviously required in the Rule 9 requests.

My Lady, for reasons of brevity only I will not repeat them orally, but I trust you understand, the possibly trenchant comments that we have already set out in paragraphs 9 and 10 of our written note. They are expressed in that way because they really do -- and the Inquiry -- no one must underestimate the concerns of a very large number of those who I represent about the atmosphere that is created by such delay in the context of this Inquiry.

The same can be said in relation to the history and the extent of the data loss that your counsel has outlined to us this afternoon. Our clients have similar concerns about the ongoing difficulties, to put it euphemistically, of what CTI have rightly described in a wide sense as informal means of government messaging and the apparent factory resetting of devices linked to the former First and deputy First Ministers as well as a number of Executive officers.

We note that although CTI's note stated and we've just been told that the consequent report of the investigation by the Executive Office would be ready by November 2023, that date has passed, and it is yet to be disclosed.

I'm not going to go to it in any detail. Our concern is self-evident and set out in writing. But we do repeat our observation that, without pre-judging the content of those investigations, it may well be insufficient or at least insufficiently independent, to assuage the concerns of those that I represent and indeed the wider public as to how and why there was such apparently widespread deletion of material, to do anything other than have an independent report, and we trust that the Inquiry will actively consider whether an independent examination will be required, and that the procedure that's presently ongoing is brought to a close sufficiently far away from the Inquiry not to make such an independent report impractical, and I know I need not have said it.

So we understand that, following the further Rule 9 requests, the Inquiry has started to receive some WhatsApp material and evidence from a number of witnesses as to their use and retention of such material, but we're anxious that any investigation takes place as soon as possible.

I suppose what I'm really saying is whilst we acknowledge the efforts being put into bottoming out this issue, we trust the Inquiry will be equally cognisant of the desire of our clients to have a clear idea of the extent to which such obviously potentially relevant evidence has indeed been lost, and with that in mind I specifically draw your attention to the comments we've set out in paragraphs 12 and 13 of our written note.

The Inquiry will not and ought not to be reticent in reminding any recalcitrant material providers of its considerable powers of enforcement, and in any event we trust that the Inquiry's optimism that complete disclosure of the vast majority of signed statements and relevant material can be made in good time proves to be well-founded, particularly given the imminent Christmas interruptions and the need for the Inquiry to review what it receives before, we quite understand, it can be made available to core participants.

With all that in mind, may I make a suggestion: we wonder whether or not a further preliminary hearing might be appropriate, given the uncertainties on this topic, so that matters can be kept under review in the course of a hearing, and that any developments can be assessed with the most up-to-date information that is then available. But I float that in the light of what your counsel has said.

I move on to my next topic, witnesses.

We note and understand that no final decisions about which witnesses will ultimately be called can be or have yet to be made, and we are grateful for the indication that any observations we may seek to make on this issue can be made hopefully next month.

May we take it, and as I speak it's not altogether clear that we will, but may we take it that we may at this stage also make appropriate representations as to whether any of the expert witnesses who the Inquiry has already heard of as part of Module 2 -- and I'm thinking particularly of Professors Henderson and Hale -- might be asked to give further oral evidence updating the evidence that was received in Module 2 during the M2C hearings.

But, my Lady, that is a matter we flag up at this stage and of course can be revisited as and when it proves to be an issue.

So far as the hearings are concerned, you are already aware of our continuing concerns about the number of days presently available within the listing. Nevertheless, I urge the Inquiry to not use that as a reason to give full consideration to the request we make at paragraph 24 of our written submissions, that for the reasons there set out it would be beneficial for the Inquiry to call more than one witness from the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign in Module 2C.

This is a matter -- I started my address to you by explaining the sensitivities of this module to those that I represent uniquely within the United Kingdom, and for the reasons I set out we do ask you to consider that topic.

In the meantime, we will continue to work hard alongside your team to be ready to start the module at the end of April next year, and will continue to facilitate such productive meetings which can not only help avoid misunderstandings but also help maximise the efficient use of what will be precious Inquiry hearing time.

You, my Lady, are aware of the stance that those that I represent have taken on the awarding and of contracts for Every Story Matters, they're set out in the written representations, I'm not going to repeat them. I will simply say that, in spite of that, of course, my Lady is aware that we will try to look at the phrasing that's in the written document. In terms of the impact film we are very willing to work with the Inquiry with a view to repeating the successful impact films that have been put in M1 and M2, and our members were involved in those then and will continue to be involved to the extent that they can.

So, my Lady, I said I was going to be half an hour, I'm not, and it really is simply because we've taken a decision that having put such material in writing we're not going to improve on it orally.

Unless there are any further matters that I can assist you with, I would simply conclude by referring you to all the points I haven't orally mentioned, which are set out in the extensive written representations that we've made.

**Lady Hallett**: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Wilcock. As you know by now, I really do appreciate such a constructive and focused approach. I'm very grateful.

**Mr Wilcock**: Thank you.

**Lady Hallett**: If the stenographer will forgive me, Ms Fee -- where are you? That way -- we'll start, I think. How long roughly do you think you'll be, Ms Fee?

**Ms Fee**: Five minutes.

**Lady Hallett**: Oh, certainly.
