4. Reply Statement by Lead Counsel to the Inquiry for Module 2C
===============================================================

**Ms Dobbin**: My Lady, if I may, I'm of course very grateful to my learned friends for the care with which they have addressed you, and I'm grateful to my learned friend Mr Wilcock as well for raising some of those issues, which I think will probably be very useful for us to discuss in January, particularly when he has had sight of the expert report that the core participants will be able to comment on, and will be able to judge maybe a bit better any other issues that arise, for example, in respect of Professor Henderson or Professor Hale.

As regards having a further hearing, my Lady, I think we're confident that that will not be necessary. We're confident that we're able to keep a sufficient eye, as it were, on how things are developing. But again, those are matters about which we will be able to develop -- sorry, we'll be able to update core participants on in January as well.

**Lady Hallett**: And if it becomes necessary, then obviously people can alert me.

**Ms Dobbin**: Of course.

My Lady, unless I can assist you any further.

**Lady Hallett**: No, I'm extremely grateful again to anybody, and I really do endorse the collaborative approach and the idea of the meetings, I think it's very much the way forward when you all have such a huge task.

So thank you all very much. That completes this preliminary hearing.
